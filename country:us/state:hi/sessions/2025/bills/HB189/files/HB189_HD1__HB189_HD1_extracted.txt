The county may also allow lot sizes of less than the minimum lot size as specified by law for lots created or used for plantation community subdivisions as defined in section 205‑4.5(a)(12)[,]; for public, private, and quasi-public utility purposes[,]; and for lots resulting from the subdivision of abandoned roadways and railroad easements."
