Section 1:
HB837 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 837 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to homeowner associations. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that while homeowner association self-governance can be successful, there have been many cases of abuse of power and other acts of malfeasance by certain association boards, association management, managing agents, and association attorneys.  This is further evidenced by public statements from leading insurance professionals that Hawaii has the nation's highest number of association directors' and officers' liability insurance claims, assertions that are more alarming because Hawaii has a disproportionately small number of homeowners associations compared to other states. The purpose of this Act is to establish an ombudsman's office for homeowner associations to address and resolve disputes involving homeowners and their associations. PART II SECTION 2.  The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Chapter OMBUDSMAN'S OFFICE FOR HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS §   -1  Definitions.  As used in this chapter: "Board", "board of directors", or "homeowner association board" means the body, regardless of name, designated in the declaration or bylaws to act on behalf of a condominium association; the board of directors of a cooperative housing corporation; or the executive board or other body, regardless of name, designated in a planned community association's association documents to act on behalf of the planned community association. "Complaints and enforcement officer" means the complaints and enforcement officer established pursuant to section    -3. "Department" means the department of commerce and consumer affairs.

"Intake specialist" means the intake specialist established pursuant to section    -3. "Ombudsman" means the association ombudsman appointed pursuant to section -2. "Ombudsman's office" means the ombudsman's office for homeowner associations established pursuant to section    -2.

HB837 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 837 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to homeowner associations. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that while homeowner association self-governance can be successful, there have been many cases of abuse of power and other acts of malfeasance by certain association boards, association management, managing agents, and association attorneys.  This is further evidenced by public statements from leading insurance professionals that Hawaii has the nation's highest number of association directors' and officers' liability insurance claims, assertions that are more alarming because Hawaii has a disproportionately small number of homeowners associations compared to other states. The purpose of this Act is to establish an ombudsman's office for homeowner associations to address and resolve disputes involving homeowners and their associations. PART II SECTION 2.  The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Chapter OMBUDSMAN'S OFFICE FOR HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS §   -1  Definitions.  As used in this chapter: "Board", "board of directors", or "homeowner association board" means the body, regardless of name, designated in the declaration or bylaws to act on behalf of a condominium association; the board of directors of a cooperative housing corporation; or the executive board or other body, regardless of name, designated in a planned community association's association documents to act on behalf of the planned community association. "Complaints and enforcement officer" means the complaints and enforcement officer established pursuant to section    -3. "Department" means the department of commerce and consumer affairs.

"Intake specialist" means the intake specialist established pursuant to section    -3. "Ombudsman" means the association ombudsman appointed pursuant to section -2. "Ombudsman's office" means the ombudsman's office for homeowner associations established pursuant to section    -2. "Unit owner" means an owner of property governed by a condominium association or planned community association or a tenant shareholder of property governed by a cooperative housing corporation. §   -2  Ombudsman's office for homeowner associations established; association ombudsman; criteria for ombudsman.  (a) There is established within the department an ombudsman's office for homeowner associations.  The ombudsman's office for homeowner associations shall be headed by the association ombudsman, who shall be appointed by the director with the approval of the governor.
