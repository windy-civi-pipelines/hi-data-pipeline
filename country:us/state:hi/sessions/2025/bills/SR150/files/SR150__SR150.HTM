SR150 THE SENATE S.R. NO. 150 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII SENATE RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION TO SUBMIT AN ANNUAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE SUMMARIZING SPECIFIC SAFETY‑RELATED INFORMATION FOR EACH GENERAL AVIATION AND COMMERCIAL TOUR OPERATOR IN THE STATE, POST AN ELECTRONIC COPY OF each REPORT ON the DEPARTMENT'S WEBSITE, AND ADOPT RULES REQUIRING THE PUBLIC POSTING OF the INFORMATION AT EVERY LOCATION OF EACH OPERATOR. WHEREAS, general aviation and commercial helicopter flights are popular activities in Hawaii that have been economically successful for some private companies; and WHEREAS, general aviation and commercial helicopter flights over residential areas can create safety hazards, such as the 2019 crash on a street in Kailua on Oahu that resulted in three deaths, the risk of which may be increased in the absence of currently available safety practices and mechanisms; and WHEREAS, following the 2019 crash in Kailua, the Chair of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) stated that "each crash underscores the urgency of improving the safety of charter flights by implementing existing [board] safety recommendations," and called for small aircraft flight safety improvements; and WHEREAS, NTSB has made repeated recommendations for safety enhancements in the helicopter tour and charter industry, including the use of crash-resistant fuel systems, flotation devices for flights over water, and terrain awareness and warning systems to reduce the risk of controlled flight into terrain; and WHEREAS, the implementation of safety measures such as crash-resistant fuel tanks can significantly reduce the risk of post-crash fires, a factor that has contributed to fatalities in multiple aviation accidents; and WHEREAS, helicopters operating in the State frequently fly over the ocean and remote terrain where emergency landings may be required, and the presence of emergency flotation devices are a critical factor in survivability in the event of an unplanned water landing; and WHEREAS, radar and terrain awareness technology have proven effective in enhancing pilot situational awareness and reducing the likelihood of accidents caused by poor visibility, weather conditions, or pilot disorientation; and WHEREAS, ensuring public access to safety-related information regarding the presence or absence of flotation devices, radar technology, and crash-resistant fuel tanks in helicopters used for commercial and general aviation flights would empower consumers and the public to make informed decisions regarding their safety; and WHEREAS, increased transparency in the aviation industry would encourage helicopter tour operators and charter companies to adopt best practices in aviation safety, thereby reducing risks to passengers, crew, and the public at large; and WHEREAS, providing detailed safety information aligns with broader efforts to enhance consumer protections and uphold the State's commitment to safeguarding its residents and visitors from avoidable risks; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, that the Department of Transportation is requested to submit an annual report to the Legislature summarizing specific safety-related information for each general aviation and commercial tour operator in the State, post an electronic copy of each report on the Department's website, and adopt rules requiring the public posting of the information at every location of each operator; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the report is requested to include the: (1)  Name of any person, whether an individual or legal entity, who has twenty percent or more ownership interest in every general aviation, helicopter tour, or charter flight operator, and the name of any general aviation or commercial tour operator company owned by the person within the last ten years; (2)  Amount and type of liability insurance maintained by each general aviation and commercial tour operator; (3)  Minimum amount of pilot training hours required by each general aviation and commercial tour operator; and (4)  Participation of each company in any nationally recognized safety program, such as the Tour Operators Program of Safety, which develops air tour safety standards; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that for each aircraft operated in the State, the Department of Transportation is requested to report the type and amount of general liability insurance carried by the operator and whether each aircraft has installed: (1)  Flotation devices; (2)  Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast technology; (3)  Crash resistant tanks; and (4)  Any other provisions as determined by the department as necessary or advisable to promote public safety and consumer disclosure; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that each annual report is requested to be made available to the public via electronic posting on the Department of Transportation's website; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of Transportation is requested to require each general aviation and commercial tour operator to publicly post in each of their places of business a summary of the information provided in each report; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Chairperson of the National Transportation Safety Board and Director of Transportation.
