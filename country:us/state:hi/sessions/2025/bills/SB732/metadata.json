Repeals an income tax exemption for persons engaged in the business of motion picture and television film production for taxable years beginning after 12/31/2023.  Amends the Motion Picture, Digital Media, and Film Production Income Tax Credit by providing an additional credit to qualified productions with a workforce of at least eighty percent local hires; requiring productions to contact all local labor unions servicing Hawaii's film industry to qualify for the credit; requiring qualified production costs of a taxpayer that exceed $1,000,000 to be certified by a CPA, rather than via tax opinion; increasing the aggregate cap amount on credits allowed in any given year, ramped down by one-sixth over five years beginning on 1/1/2028; and including broadcast and streaming platform productions under the credit.  Applies the GET rate for manufacturers to productions.  Exempts from the GET amounts received by a motion picture project employer from a client equal to amounts that are disbursed by the motion picture project employer for employee wages, salaries, payroll taxes, insurance premiums, and employment benefits and payments to loan-out companies.  Repeals certain tax exemptions and the Motion Picture, Digital Media, and Film Production Income Tax Credit on 1/1/2033.  Appropriates funds.  Effective 7/1/3000.  (HD2)"
