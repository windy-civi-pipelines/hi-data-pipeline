SR107 THE SENATE S.R. NO. 107 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII SENATE RESOLUTION Requesting the Attorney General to produce and provide a list of state lands currently leased to the United States of America or any federal agency. WHEREAS, article XI, section 1 of the Hawaii State Constitution provides that "the State and its political subdivisions shall conserve and protect Hawaii's natural beauty and all natural resources . . . and shall promote the development and utilization of these resources in a manner consistent with their conservation and in furtherance of the self-sufficiency of the State"; and WHEREAS, the State currently leases tens of thousands of acres of state land to the federal government, including various sites which have been leased to the United States military for the past sixty years at the price of one dollar; and WHEREAS, the military has proven to be an unreliable steward of the State's land and waters, as demonstrated by the Red Hill water contamination crisis on Oʻahu, the indiscriminate bombing of Kahoʻolawe and subsequent incomplete cleanup of unexploded ordinance, and many other incidents; and WHEREAS, the United States Army itself has acknowledged that "continued loss of ʻāina represents a disproportionate and a long term, significant, adverse impact on communities with environmental justice concerns"; and WHEREAS, the Trump administration has taken actions that further endanger the State's natural resources, including by asserting that national parks and public lands are assets on "the nation's balance sheet," by indicating that public lands may be sold off to raise money for a new "sovereign wealth fund," and by issuing an executive order calling for the "immediate expansion" of timber production on federal lands; and WHEREAS, these policies have had an immediate negative effect on precious state lands and resources, including by eliminating funding for critical environmental and agricultural programs across the State, and by eliminating staff and caretakers at federally-owned properties within the State; and WHEREAS, these policies are poised to do further harm to the State, including as a result of the Secretary of the Interior's order requiring federal agencies to assess the feasibility of fracking, drilling, and mining across all public lands and waters, such as Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument; and WHEREAS, the federal government has thus demonstrated a clear unwillingness or inability to responsibly steward state lands entrusted to it as a lessee; and WHEREAS, the current administration's actions and stated intentions represent a clear and present danger to the conservation and protection of the State's natural beauty and natural resources; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, that the Attorney General is requested to produce and provide a list of state lands currently leased to the United States of America or any federal agency; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Attorney General is requested to review all current leases of state land to the federal government and to recommend to the Legislature and the state lessor whether the renewal of the lease would or would not be in the public interest and consistent with the Hawaii State Constitution and any applicable state law; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that any lessor of state land to the federal government is requested to furnish information to the Attorney General as necessary to assist with the tasks requested by this Concurrent Resolution; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a certified copy of this Resolution be transmitted to the Attorney General.
