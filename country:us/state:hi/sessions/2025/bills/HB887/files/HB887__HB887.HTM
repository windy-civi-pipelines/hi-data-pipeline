Section 1:
HB887 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 887 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to prevailing wages. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii provides prevailing wage protections for one hundred thirty-one unique job classifications, all of which are traditionally male-dominated occupations, for State-funded contracts.  The legislature further finds that in contrast, when the State awards contracts for human services providers, most of whom are female, it does not set prevailing wages for those professionals.  The legislature also finds that this disparity affects the economic security of these workers and the quality and continuity of care for Hawaii's children, elderly, individuals exiting the carceral system, individuals with disabilities, and individuals with mental health challenges. Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to promote equity and stability in Hawaii by establishing prevailing wage protections for human services providers hired through contracts with the State. SECTION 2.  The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Chapter WAGES AND HOURS OF HUMAN SERVICES PROVIDERS CONTRACTED BY THE STATE OR COUNTIES PART I. GENERAL PROVISIONS §   -1  Definitions. As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires: "Basic hourly rate" means the hourly wage paid to a human services provider for work performed during nonovertime hours, but shall not include the cost to an employer of furnishing fringe benefits, whether paid directly or indirectly to the human services provider as provided in the definition of "wages". "Contractor" means any person furnishing human services under a contract with a governmental contracting agency, subcontractor, or any other person under a subcontract arrangement with any person who has a contract subject to this chapter. "County" means the city and county of Honolulu, county of Hawaii, county of Kauai, and county of Maui. "Department" means the department of labor and industrial relations. "Director" means the director of labor and industrial relations of the State.

"Human services" includes social work, case work, and investigative services intended to improve the lives of individuals and families by, among other duties, evaluating an individual's needs, creating a treatment plan for the individual, implementing the plan, and providing emotional support. "Human services provider" includes a social worker, case worker, or investigator employed by a private organization providing human services under a contract with a governmental contracting agency. "Overtime compensation" means compensation based on not less than one and one-half times the human services providers' basic hourly rate of pay plus the cost to an employer of furnishing a human services provider with fringe benefits as described in the definition of "wages"; provided that if the department determines that a prevailing wage is defined by a collective bargaining agreement, the overtime compensation shall be at the rates set by the applicable collective bargaining agreement. "Wages", "rate of wages", "wage rates", "minimum wages" and "prevailing wages" mean the basic hourly rate and the cost to an employer of furnishing a human services provider with fringe benefits, including but not limited to health and welfare benefits, vacation benefits, and pension benefits, whether paid directly or indirectly to the human services provider. §   -2  Applicability; wages, hours, and other requirements.  (a)  This chapter shall apply to every contract in excess of $2,000 for human services to which a governmental contracting agency is a party.

(e) The governmental contracting agency may withhold from the contractor so much of the accrued payments as the governmental contracting agency may consider necessary to pay to the human services providers employed by the contractor or any subcontractor the difference between the prevailing wages and the wages received and not refunded by the human services providers. (f) Every contract in excess of $2,000 for human services and the specifications for such contract shall include provisions that set forth the requirements of subsections (a) to (e); provided that failure by the contracting agency to include those provisions in the contract or specifications shall not be a defense of the contractor or subcontractor for noncompliance with the requirements of this chapter. (g) For any provision of human services that is subject to this chapter but not directly caused by a governmental contracting agency, the director shall be responsible for enforcement of this chapter, including the collection and maintenance of certified copies of all payrolls that are subject to this chapter.

Any certification discrepancy found by the contracting agency shall be reported to the general contractor and the director to effect compliance. (b)  Payroll records for all human services providers performing work shall be maintained by the general contractor and the general contractor's subcontractors, if any, during the course of the work and preserved for a period of three years thereafter.  The records shall contain the name of each employee, the employee's correct classification, rate of pay, the itemized fringe benefit reporting form pursuant to subsection (a), daily and weekly number of hours worked, deductions made, and actual wages paid.

However, any claim for liquidated damages, insofar as the surety or sureties are concerned, shall not be paid until the claims of all other creditors have been satisfied. §   -28  Civil action.  (a) The following civil actions may be instituted in any court of competent jurisdiction: (1)  An action to recover unpaid wages or overtime compensation may be maintained by any one or more human services providers for and on behalf of oneself or themselves and others similarly situated; and (2)  An action for injunctive and other relief against an employer that fails to pay the prevailing wage to its employees as required by this chapter by a joint labor-management committee established pursuant to section 175a of the federal Labor Management Cooperation Act of 1978 (29 U.S.C. 175a).

The director shall adopt reasonable rules pursuant to chapter 91 to determine the prevailing wages, enforcement, administration, and general purposes of this chapter.  These rules shall have the force and effect of law. §   -30  Application of this chapter to contracts entered into without regard to other laws. The fact that a contract is or was entered into without regard to chapter 103D, or upon a cost-plus-a-fixed fee basis, or cost-plus-a-fixed percentage basis, or without advertising for proposals, shall not render this chapter inapplicable to the contract, if this chapter would otherwise be applicable. §   -31  Effect on other laws.  Neither this chapter nor any rule or other action under this chapter shall supersede or impair any minimum wage or maximum hour law or any authority otherwise granted by law to provide for the establishment of specific minimum or other wage rates. §   -32  Suspension during emergency.  During a national emergency declared by the President or the Congress of the United States, or a state of emergency declared by the governor, subject to the provisions of section 127-10 or 128-7, the governor, by executive order in writing, may suspend this chapter; provided that the governor may not suspend this chapter except in the event such an emergency occurs and is so proclaimed. §   -33  Inspection.  (a)  If work performed in accordance with this chapter, in excess of eight hours in any day or on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday of the State, requires inspection by the State or any county, the inspection shall be conducted by the State or county, as applicable. (b)  In such event, it shall be lawful, notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, for the State or any county to alter the normal working hours of public employees, as may be needed for these purposes, and to pay these public employees for all hours worked in excess of eight hours per day or on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday of the State. §   -34  Submission of collective bargaining agreement to the director.  (a)  Parties to a collective bargaining agreement covering classes of human services providers, which are included in the prevailing wage determinations made pursuant to this chapter, shall submit a copy of the agreement to the director within five days after execution of the agreement. (b)  Except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of the agreement shall be kept confidential by the director.  The director may disclose terms of the agreement to any federal or state agency for the purpose of enforcing this chapter." SECTION 3.  This Act does not affect rights and duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, and proceedings that were begun before its effective date. SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.

PART II. ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT §   -21  Governmental contracting agency responsibilities.  The governmental contracting agency shall: (1)  Pay or cause to be paid, within sixty days of a determination made by the director, directly to human services providers or to the director, from any accrued payment withheld under the terms of the contract, any wages or overtime compensation found to be due to human services providers under the terms of the contract subject to this chapter, or any penalty assessed; (2)  Order any contractor to pay, within sixty days of a determination made by the director, any wages or overtime compensation that the contractor, or any of the contractor's subcontractors, should have paid to any human services provider under any contract subject to this chapter, or any penalty assessed which the contractor, or any of the contractor's subcontractors, should have paid to the director; and (3)  Report to the director any violation of this chapter, the rules adopted thereunder, or the terms of the contract subject to this chapter. §   -22  Investigation; penalties.  (a)  The department may conduct investigations to determine compliance with this chapter. The department may examine the records of any contractor, either during or after the performance of any contract, or subpoena the records.  The department may also interview employees during working hours on the job. (b)  If any contractor interferes with or delays any investigation by the department, the governmental contracting agency, on receipt of written notice from the director of the interference or delay, shall withhold from the contractor all further payments until the director has notified the governmental contracting agency in writing that the interference or delay has ceased.  Interference or delay includes failure to provide requested records under section -4; failure to allow employees to be interviewed during working hours on the job; and falsification of records required under this chapter.  The department shall assess a penalty of $10,000 per contract for interference or delay.  For each day thereafter that the employer fails to cooperate, the director shall assess a penalty of $1,000 per contract.

(d)  A first, second, or third violation refers to each contract in which the department finds that a contractor has failed to comply with this chapter. (e)  Both the person and firm shall be listed on each notice of violation. (f)  As used in this section: "Firm" includes a non-profit, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, and limited partnership. "New work on a contract" includes any contract in which the suspended person or firm has not begun work as of the date of the suspension order. "Offense" means each section of this chapter under which the contractor is cited; provided that, with respect to prevailing wage and overtime citations under section    -2, each employee and each contract shall be considered a separate offense. "Person" includes a sole proprietor and the principal responsible managing employee of a firm. §   -25  Suspension.  (a) The director shall suspend a person and firm as follows: (1)  For a first or second violation, if a person or firm fails to pay wages found due or any penalty assessed, or both, the person and firm shall be immediately suspended from doing any work on any contract with a governmental contracting agency until all wages and penalties are paid in full; (2)  For a third violation, the suspension shall be as prescribed in section    -24(c); provided that if the person or firm continues to violate this chapter or fails to pay wages found due or any penalty assessed, or both, then the person and firm shall immediately be suspended from doing any work on any contract with a governmental contracting agency for a mandatory three-year period. If after the three-year suspension period, the wages found due or penalties assessed are still unpaid, the suspension shall remain in force until payment is made in full; or (3)  For falsification of records, or for delay or interference with an investigation pursuant to section    -22, the person and firm shall be immediately suspended for a period of three years. (b)  The director shall immediately notify the governmental contracting agency, comptroller, auditor or director of finance of the county, and, in the case of a suspended subcontractor, general contractor of any suspension order. (c)  No contract shall be awarded to the person and firm so suspended or to any firm, corporation, partnership, or association in which the person or firm has an interest, direct or indirect, until three years have elapsed from the date of suspension, unless the period of suspension is reduced or extended as herein provided. Any contract awarded in violation of this subsection shall be void. (d)  As used in this section, "person" includes a sole proprietor and the principal responsible managing employee of a firm. §   -26  Judicial review.  (a) Any party to an appeal under this chapter may obtain judicial review of the decision on the appeal in the manner provided in chapter 91. (b)  Any suspension or dismissal of any complaint under this chapter shall be subject to appeal in circuit court by the aggrieved party, under section 91-14 and rule 72 of the Hawaii rules of civil procedure. §   -27  Liability.  If the accrued payments withheld under the terms of the contract are insufficient to reimburse all the human services providers for wages or overtime compensation due under this chapter, and the contractor has failed to pay the wages or overtime compensation, the contractor and the contractor's sureties shall be liable to the human services providers in the amount of the unpaid wages and overtime compensation due, and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages. However, any claim for liquidated damages, insofar as the surety or sureties are concerned, shall not be paid until the claims of all other creditors have been satisfied. §   -28  Civil action.  (a) The following civil actions may be instituted in any court of competent jurisdiction: (1)  An action to recover unpaid wages or overtime compensation may be maintained by any one or more human services providers for and on behalf of oneself or themselves and others similarly situated; and (2)  An action for injunctive and other relief against an employer that fails to pay the prevailing wage to its employees as required by this chapter by a joint labor-management committee established pursuant to section 175a of the federal Labor Management Cooperation Act of 1978 (29 U.S.C. 175a). (b)  The court, in its action and in addition to any judgment awarded to the plaintiff or plaintiffs, shall allow reasonable attorney's fees and costs of the action to be paid by the defendant. (c)  It shall be no defense that the human services providers accepted or agreed to accept less than the required rate of wages or overtime compensation or voluntarily made refunds. (d)  When a written request is filed by any human services provider with the director claiming unpaid wages or overtime compensation under this chapter, the director, after receiving an assignment from the human services provider, may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to recover the amount of the claim.  The consent of any human services provider to the bringing of such action by the director, unless the action is dismissed without prejudice on motion of the director, shall constitute a waiver by the human services provider of any right of action the human services provider may have under subsection (a).  Any amount recovered by the director before suit and accepted by the human services provider as payment in full shall constitute a waiver of any rights under this chapter. §   -29  Rules. The director shall adopt reasonable rules pursuant to chapter 91 to determine the prevailing wages, enforcement, administration, and general purposes of this chapter.  These rules shall have the force and effect of law. §   -30  Application of this chapter to contracts entered into without regard to other laws. The fact that a contract is or was entered into without regard to chapter 103D, or upon a cost-plus-a-fixed fee basis, or cost-plus-a-fixed percentage basis, or without advertising for proposals, shall not render this chapter inapplicable to the contract, if this chapter would otherwise be applicable. §   -31  Effect on other laws.  Neither this chapter nor any rule or other action under this chapter shall supersede or impair any minimum wage or maximum hour law or any authority otherwise granted by law to provide for the establishment of specific minimum or other wage rates. §   -32  Suspension during emergency.  During a national emergency declared by the President or the Congress of the United States, or a state of emergency declared by the governor, subject to the provisions of section 127-10 or 128-7, the governor, by executive order in writing, may suspend this chapter; provided that the governor may not suspend this chapter except in the event such an emergency occurs and is so proclaimed. §   -33  Inspection.  (a)  If work performed in accordance with this chapter, in excess of eight hours in any day or on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday of the State, requires inspection by the State or any county, the inspection shall be conducted by the State or county, as applicable. (b)  In such event, it shall be lawful, notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, for the State or any county to alter the normal working hours of public employees, as may be needed for these purposes, and to pay these public employees for all hours worked in excess of eight hours per day or on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday of the State. §   -34  Submission of collective bargaining agreement to the director.  (a)  Parties to a collective bargaining agreement covering classes of human services providers, which are included in the prevailing wage determinations made pursuant to this chapter, shall submit a copy of the agreement to the director within five days after execution of the agreement. (b)  Except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of the agreement shall be kept confidential by the director.  The director may disclose terms of the agreement to any federal or state agency for the purpose of enforcing this chapter." SECTION 3.  This Act does not affect rights and duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, and proceedings that were begun before its effective date.
