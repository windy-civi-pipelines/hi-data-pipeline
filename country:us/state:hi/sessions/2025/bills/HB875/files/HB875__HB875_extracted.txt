BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the Hawaiʻi state capitol has long been a hub for civic education, offering visitors insight into the rich history, culture, and governance of our State.  Previously, a dedicated capitol tour guide provided professional and consistent tours to ensure that the public received an accurate and engaging understanding of the building's historical and architectural significance.  Since the passing of the last tour guide, however, the position has remained vacant, placing an undue burden on legislative offices to provide tours and often leading to inconsistent and incomplete experiences for visitors. The purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds for a state capitol tour guide position to be placed within the public access room. SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the funding of one full-time equivalent(1.0 FTE) state capitol tour guide position within the public access room.
