HB716 HD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 716 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO HEALTH. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that federally qualified health centers, rural health clinics, Ryan White HIV/AIDS program centers, and Native Hawaiian health centers are a vital source of health care access and public health for Hawaii's underserved population, serving twenty per cent of residents. Foundational health information technology infrastructure is needed to transform health care delivery and maintain public health readiness and recovery.  Certified, hosted, and maintained health information technology, including software and hardware upgrades and related technical support, are an essential component of equitable access to care, particularly in the artificial intelligence era.  Such systems enhance care coordination, improve patient outcomes, and assist providers in meeting regulatory obligations.  They also promote public health by equipping providers and government agencies with the information necessary to understand their community's needs and craft data-driven policies.  Equally important, health information technology systems that share information seamlessly are critical in supporting trauma informed care by ensuring that sensitive patient health information is interoperable among providers, thereby reducing the need to repeatedly ask questions that could be traumatic for patients. The legislature further finds that certified, hosted, and maintained health information technology infrastructure requires significant upfront investment that is not feasible for many providers in rural and underserved areas.  The resulting difference in the quality of health information technology available to providers creates disparities in care and public health outcomes in rural and underserved communities. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish a grant program within the department of health, to be administered by the state health planning and development agency, to support a certified, hosted, and maintained health information technology infrastructure and the implementation of interoperable health information technologies for federally qualified health centers, rural health clinics, Ryan White HIV/AIDS program centers, and Native Hawaiian health centers in Hawaii. SECTION 2.  Chapter 323D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new subpart to part II to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "   .  Health Infrastructure Grant Program §323D-     Definitions.  As used in this subpart: "Certified" means  certified under the United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology's Health IT Certification Program, which includes interoperability and cybersecurity requirements pursuant to title 45 Code of Federal Regulations, part 170, subpart B.
