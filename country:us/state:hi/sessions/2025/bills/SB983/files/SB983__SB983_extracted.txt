Section 1:
SB983 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 983 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to small business loans. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain issues, and inflation have hurt the State's economy and local businesses on every level, including the start-up industry.  Despite this, many small businesses and entrepreneurs are ready to take the leap into starting up a business, but lack the resources to do so, as access to capital is one of the biggest barriers for start-ups. The legislature further finds that new businesses and young companies under five years of age create the most net new jobs in the United States.  While the State offers a variety of financial assistance to start-up businesses in Hawaii, most of the assistance is focused on helping existing businesses expand and scale, rather than helping brand new businesses successfully launch. The legislature believes that providing support to local small businesses and entrepreneurs seeking to start a new business could lead to the creation of more jobs in the State. The purpose of this Act is to benefit the local economy and create new jobs by establishing and appropriating funds for the Hawaii Start-Up Business Loan Program to encourage entrepreneurship and promote economic diversification and resilience in the State. SECTION 2. The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Chapter HAWAII START-UP BUSINESS LOAN PROGRAM §   -1 Definitions.  As used in this chapter: "Department" means the department of business, economic development, and tourism.
