SB1218 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1218 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to the conveyance tax. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the health, happiness, and well-being of Hawaii's people depends on the State's ability to address the high cost of living, particularly the high cost of housing, that is fueling the homelessness crisis and forcing local families to move out of the State.  The sustainability of the State's unique and irreplaceable natural resources is critical to its residents' quality of life.  To address these problems and secure a prosperous future for the State's children, greater investment into public resources from a sustainable revenue source is needed to reduce the cost of housing for residents, preserve the State's natural resources, and provide solutions for community members experiencing houselessness. The legislature also finds that the conveyance tax, a one‑time tax at the time of real property sales, is an appropriate revenue source for affordable housing, land conservation, and homeless services.  Although housing prices in the State have risen dramatically over the past thirteen years, the State's conveyance tax rates have not been updated since Act 59, Session Laws of Hawaii 2009.  Presently, the State's conveyance tax is significantly lower than the rates of other high-cost areas in the country. Cities across the country are increasing their conveyance tax rates to fund affordable housing.  San Francisco increased the tax rate to 5.5 per cent on homes valued over $10,000,000 in 2020, and three years ago, Los Angeles increased the real property transfer tax to 4.5 per cent on any residential or commercial property over $5,000,000 in value and six per cent on property sales over $10,000,000 in value.  Smaller cities with high housing costs are also increasing the taxes on real estate sales to mitigate the impacts of housing costs.  Crested Butte and Telluride in Colorado, which attract wealthy buyers due to access to world class ski opportunities, have a tax of three per cent on home sales regardless of price.  Aspen, Colorado, which has the most well-developed workforce housing program in the country where almost forty per cent of the housing total housing stock is reserved as permanently affordable housing for full‑time residents, has largely funded their workforce housing program through a 1.5 per cent tax on property sales that has been in place since 1989. Presently, it is common practice to tax property sales as a means to mitigate the impacts of high home costs and the loss of land due to housing development.  Furthermore, a conveyance tax of 0.5 per cent on homes valued at less than $5,000,000, a rate of four per cent on homes valued between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000, and six per cent on homes valued at over $10,000,000, conforms to tax rates that other cities have adopted to fund their various housing programs. The legislature recognizes that the increases in housing prices, residential rent, and the homeless population over the past several years has accelerated the urgent need to sustainably fund affordable housing and homeless services in Hawaii.  The 2023 point in time count estimates that there are currently 6,223 individuals living unsheltered in the State, not including the greater number of "hidden homeless" individuals temporarily living with friends or relatives because they cannot afford to live on their own.  Investing in affordable housing and homeless services, including supportive housing, is key to addressing homelessness and ensuring that everyone in the State has an affordable place to live. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Establish the homeless services special fund; (2)  Allow counties to apply for matching funds from the affordable homeownership revolving fund for housing projects that are subject to a perpetual affordability requirement; (3)  Increase the conveyance tax rates for certain properties; (4)  Repeal the separate conveyance tax rates for the sale of a condominium or single family residence for which the purchaser is ineligible for a county homeowner's exemption or property tax and establish conveyance tax rates for multifamily residential properties; (5)  Exempt from conveyance taxes the conveyances of real property to: (A)  Organizations with certain affordability requirements; (B)  Certain nonprofit organizations; and (C)  An owner-occupant or renter-occupant of the property; and (6)  Allocate collected conveyance taxes to the affordable homeownership revolving fund, homeless services special fund, and general fund and amend allocations to the land conservation fund, and rental housing revolving fund. SECTION 2.  Chapter 346, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part XVII to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§346-    Homeless services special fund.  (a)  There is established within the state treasury a homeless services special fund, to be administered and managed by the department and into which shall be deposited: (1)  Ten per cent of the conveyance tax collected and allocated to the homeless services fund pursuant to section 247-7; (2)  Appropriations made by the legislature; and (3)  Interest earned upon any moneys in the fund. (b)  Moneys from any other private or public source may be deposited in or credited to the fund; provided that any mandates, regulations, or conditions on the funds shall not conflict with the use of the fund under this section.  Moneys received as a deposit or private contribution shall be deposited, used, and accounted for in accordance with the conditions established by the agency or person making the contribution. (c)  Moneys in the homeless services special fund shall be used by the department for homeless services and supportive housing, including homeless facilities programs for the homeless authorized by the department. (d)  The department shall submit a report to the legislature providing an accounting of the fund no later than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular session.  The report shall include, at minimum: (1)  A detailed account of all funds received; and (2)  All moneys expended from the homeless services special fund." SECTION 3.  Section 201H-206, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "[[]§201H-206[]]  Affordable homeownership revolving fund. (a)  There is established an affordable homeownership revolving fund to be administered by the corporation for the purpose of providing, in whole or in part, loans to nonprofit community development financial institutions and nonprofit housing development organizations for the development of affordable homeownership housing projects. (b)  Loans shall be awarded in the following descending order of priority: (1)  Projects or units in projects that are funded by programs of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, United States Department of Agriculture Rural Development, and United States Department of the Treasury Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, wherein: (A)  At least fifty per cent of the available units are reserved for persons and families having incomes at or below eighty per cent of the median family income and of which at least five per cent of the available units are for persons and families having incomes at or below fifty per cent of the median family income; and (B)  The remaining units are reserved for persons and families having incomes at or below one hundred twenty per cent of the median family income; and (2)  Mixed-income affordable for-sale housing projects or units in a mixed-income affordable for-sale housing project wherein all of the available units are reserved for persons and families having incomes at or below one hundred per cent of the median family income. (c)  Moneys in the fund shall be used to provide loans for the development, pre-development, construction, acquisition, preservation, and substantial rehabilitation of affordable for‑sale housing units. Uses of moneys in the fund may include but are not limited to planning, design, and land acquisition, including the costs of options, agreements of sale, and down payments; equity financing as matching funds for nonprofit community development financial institutions; or other housing development services or activities as provided in rules adopted by the corporation pursuant to chapter 91.  The rules may provide that money from the fund shall be leveraged with other financial resources to the extent possible. (d)  The fund may include [sums]: (1)  Sums appropriated by the legislature[, private]; (2)  Private contributions[, proceeds]; (3)  Proceeds from repayment of loans[, interest,]; (4)  Interest and other returns[,]; (5)  Conveyance taxes collected under chapter 247 and allocated to the affordable homeownership revolving fund pursuant to section 247-7; and [moneys] (6)  Moneys from other sources. (e)  An amount from the fund, to be set by the corporation and authorized by the legislature, may be used for administrative expenses incurred by the corporation in administering the fund; provided that moneys in the fund shall not be used to finance day-to-day administrative expenses of the projects allotted moneys from the fund. (f)  The corporation may provide loans under this section as provided in rules adopted by the corporation pursuant to chapter 91. (g)  The corporation may contract with nonprofit community development financial institutions to fund loans under this section.  The corporation may contract for the service and custody of its loans. (h)  The corporation may establish, revise, charge, and collect a reasonable service fee, as necessary, in connection with its loans, services, and approvals under this part.  The fees shall be deposited into the affordable homeownership revolving fund.

[(i)] (j)  The corporation shall submit a report to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular session describing the projects funded using moneys from the affordable homeownership revolving fund."
