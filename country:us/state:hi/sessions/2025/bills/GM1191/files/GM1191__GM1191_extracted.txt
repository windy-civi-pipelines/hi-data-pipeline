A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO LICENSE PLATES.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that numerous private
2 organizations have attempted to amend existing law to enable
3 special number plates with full-plate designs to raise revenue
4 for their causes. While successful in some cases, the
5 legislature also finds that the county agencies responsible for
6 issuing license plates bear significant burden contracting to
7 produce new license plates each time a new license plate law is
8 adopted. In addition, creating a full-plate design requires
9 acquiring non-standard specialized license plates, which can
10 cause complications with procurement and cost.
11 The legislature further finds that existing law allows
12 private organizations to apply for and have license plate
13 designs based on decals added to standard license plates limited
14 to three inches wide by three inches high, which can raise
15 revenue for their causes, without having to change the law, or
16 add burden to the counties.

1 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to reduce the
2 burden on organizations attempting to amend special number plate
3 statutes and the counties attempting to implement special number
4 plate requirements by expanding the existing decal size
S restrictions.
6 SECTION 2. Section 249-9.3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
7 amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:
8 "(a) In lieu of the number plates contracted on behalf of
9 the counties by the director of finance of the city and county
10 of Honolulu, the county directors of finance shall issue special
11 number plates to any organization in the State that meets the
12 minimum standards and qualifications established under this
13 section. Organizations are authorized to retain the fees
14 collected, less expenses, for the special number plates.
15 The director of finance of the city and county of Honolulu,
16 in consultation with the directors of finance of the counties of
17 Kauai, Maui, and Hawaii, shall establish special design
18 parameters and restrictions for decals or graphic
19 representations affixable to special number plates; provided
20 that the decal shall not be larger than [three] four inches wide
21 by [-fehr^ee] four inches high."
