SB148 SD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 148 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO COMBAT SPORTS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii has embraced full-contact combat sports that allow the use of both striking and grappling techniques; involve both standing and on‑the‑ground; and blend boxing, wrestling, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai, kickboxing, karate, judo, and other styles.  Combat sports events have drawn capacity crowds to the Neal S. Blaisdell Arena. The prestigious Ultimate Fighting Championship organization has never staged a show in Hawaii, but the idea has been floated many times.  The legislature finds that to continue growing the combat sports industry in the State and to attract events like those staged by the Ultimate Fighting Championship, Hawaii's boxing commission should be expanded to include combat sports. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Rename the existing boxing commission of Hawaii to the combat sports commission of Hawaii and expand its jurisdiction to include combat sports and mixed martial arts; and (2)  Repeal the existing mixed martial arts program under chapter 440E, Hawaii Revised Statutes.

Blaisdell Arena. The prestigious Ultimate Fighting Championship organization has never staged a show in Hawaii, but the idea has been floated many times.  The legislature finds that to continue growing the combat sports industry in the State and to attract events like those staged by the Ultimate Fighting Championship, Hawaii's boxing commission should be expanded to include combat sports. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Rename the existing boxing commission of Hawaii to the combat sports commission of Hawaii and expand its jurisdiction to include combat sports and mixed martial arts; and (2)  Repeal the existing mixed martial arts program under chapter 440E, Hawaii Revised Statutes.
