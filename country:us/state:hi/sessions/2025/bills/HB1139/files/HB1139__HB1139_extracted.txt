Section 1:
HB1139 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1139 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP FEES. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii's natural resources, including reefs, oceans, forests, streams, estuaries, shorelines, and beaches, provide irreplaceable and invaluable benefits to visitors, residents, and the global community at large. These resources, however, face unprecedented pressure from climate change and the extensive use they receive from millions who come to experience Hawaii's unique environment.  The effects of climate change and overuse are creating significant risks, including wildfires, floods, coastal erosion, the degradation of coral reefs, and the pollution of air and water supplies.  These issues threaten the lives, homes, and health of residents, as well as the stability of Hawaii's ecosystems and economy. Article XI, section 1, and article XII, sections 4 and 7, of the Hawai`i Constitution make clear that Hawaii's natural and cultural resources are the essence of the public trust, and therefore must be managed and protected for the benefit of present and future generations.  The Hawai`i Constitution also recognizes the importance of a clean and healthful environment and requires the State and its agencies to protect traditional and customary rights, which are dependent upon carefully managed and abundant natural resources.  This Act should be construed as a means for fulfilling these constitutional mandates. The legislature further finds that there has been chronic underinvestment in the protection and management of Hawaii's natural and cultural resources, limiting the ability of the State to effectively mitigate and respond to the growing challenges brought upon by climate change and overuse. Underinvestment in Hawaii's natural resources poses a significant liability to its visitor industry and the stability of its natural systems, including its effects on food systems and water quality, ecosystem services, fisheries, economic resilience, and health and safety of the citizens of the State. The legislature recognizes that Hawai`i residents have long been stewards of the State's natural and cultural resources, contributing through taxes, environmental care, subsistence and cultural practices, and the values and practices embodied in the Hawai`i Constitution.  However, with the ever increasing environmental pressures and visitor impacts, there is an immediate need to ensure that all who enjoy and benefit from Hawaii's natural and cultural resources contribute to their protection, restoration, and sustainable management.  It is pono or appropriate to ask visitors who enjoy and reap the benefits of Hawaii's natural and cultural resources to contribute to the protection, restoration, and stewardship of these resources. The legislature believes that establishing a dedicated program, supported by appropriate funding mechanisms, is essential to protect and restore Hawaii's natural and cultural heritage.  By building resilience against the impacts of human activity, this Act seeks to safeguard Hawaii's environment for the enjoyment and well-being of all, now and in the future. The purpose of this Act is to establish an environmental stewardship fee program, administered by the board of land and natural resources, that includes a license and assessment of a fee on visitors for the usage of Hawaii's state-owned designated beaches, parks, forests, trails, recreational natural areas, and coastlines, to: (1)  Provide sustained funding for the protection, restoration, regeneration, enhancement, and care of Hawaii's natural and cultural resources; and (2)  Build resilience of these resources to the impacts of increased visitor use.
