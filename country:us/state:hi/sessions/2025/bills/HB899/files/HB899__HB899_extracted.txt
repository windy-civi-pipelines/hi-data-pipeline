HB899 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 899 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to growth and development in sexuality health education curriculum. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that an understanding of fetal growth and development is essential to a comprehensive sexual health education program.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that sexual health education curricula be medically accurate and consistent with scientific research.  Further, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recognize that students with access to sexual health education programs are more likely to have fewer sexual partners, use protection during sex, and postpone engaging in sexual activity. The purpose of this Act is to provide students with a medically accurate understanding of fetal growth and development to reduce their likelihood of engaging in high-risk sexual behavior.
