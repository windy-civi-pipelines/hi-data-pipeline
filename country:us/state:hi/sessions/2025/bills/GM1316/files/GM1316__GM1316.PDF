1 "(a) The department, for the nine-month period April 1,
2 1941, to December 31, 1941, and for each calendar year
3 thereafter, except as otherwise provided in this part, shall
4 classify employers in accordance with their actual experience in

6 charged against their accounts with a view to fixing the
7 contribution rates to reflect this experience. The department
8 shall determine the contribution rate of each employer in
9 accordance with the following requirements:
10 (1) The standard rate of contributions payable by each
11 employer for any calendar year through 1984 shall be
12 three per cent. For calendar years 1985 and
13 thereafter, the standard rate of contributions payable
14 by each employer shall be five and four-tenths per
15 cent;
16 (2) No employer's rate for the calendar year 1942 and for
17 any calendar year thereafter shall be other than the
18 maximum rate unless and until the employer's account
19 has been chargeable with benefits throughout the
20 thirty-six consecutive calendar month period ending on
21 December 31 of the preceding calendar year, except

1 that, for the calendar year 1956 and for each calendar
2 year thereafter, an employer who has not been subject
3 to the law for a sufficient period to meet this
4 requirement may qualify for a rate other than the
5 maximum rate if the employer's account has been
6 chargeable throughout a lesser period but in no event
7 less than the twelve consecutive calendar month period
8 ending on December 31 of the preceding calendar year.
9 For the calendar years 1985 through 1991, the
10 contribution rate for a new or newly covered employer

14 pursuant to section 383-68 (a), until the employer's
15 account has been chargeable with benefits throughout
16 the twelve consecutive calendar month period ending on
17 December 31 of the preceding calendar year; except
18 that no employer's contribution rate shall be greater
19 than five and four-tenths per cent and no employer

2 thereafter, the contribution rate for a new or newly
3 covered employer shall be the contribution rate
4 assigned to any employer with .0000 reserve ratio,
5 until the employer's account has been chargeable with
6 benefits throughout the twelve consecutive calendar
7 month period ending on December 31 of the preceding
8 calendar year;
9 (3) Any amount credited to this State under section 903 of
10 the Social Security Act[—] of 1935, as amended, which
11 has been appropriated for expenses of administration,
12 whether or not withdrawn from the trust fund, shall be
13 excluded from the fund for the purposes of this
14 paragraph. Any advance that may be made to this State
15 under section 1201 of the Social Security Act[—] of
16 1935, whether or not withdrawn from this trust fund,
17 shall be excluded from the fund for the purposes of
18 this paragraph. No employer's rate shall be reduced
19 in any amount that is not allowable as an additional
20 credit, against the tax levied by the [-fedoral-]

2 or pursuant to any other federal statute, successor to
3 section 3302(b), which provides for the additional
4 credit now provided for in section 3302(b);
5 (4) If, when any classification of employers is to be made
6 (which may be after the commencement of the period for
7 which the classification is to be made), the
8 department finds that any employer has failed to file
9 any report required in connection therewith or has
10 filed a report that the department finds incorrect or
11 insufficient, the department shall notify the employer
12 thereof by mail addressed to the employer's last known
13 address. Unless the employer files the report or a
14 corrected or sufficient report, as the case may be,
15 within fifteen days after the mailing of the notice,
16 the maximum rate of contributions shall be payable by
17 the employer for the period for which the contribution
18 rate is to be fixed. Effective January 1, 1987, the
19 director, for excusable failure, may redetermine the
20 assignment of the maximum contribution rate in
21 accordance with this section, provided the employer

6 December 31, 1939, any employing unit in any manner
7 succeeds to or acquires the organization, trade, or
8 business, or substantially all the assets thereof
9 (whether or not the successor or acquiring unit was an
10 "employing unit", as that term is defined in section

9 accordance with the following requirements:
10 (1) The standard rate of contributions payable by each
11 employer for any calendar year through 1984 shall be
12 three per cent. For calendar years 1985 and
13 thereafter, the standard rate of contributions payable
14 by each employer shall be five and four-tenths per
15 cent;
16 (2) No employer's rate for the calendar year 1942 and for
17 any calendar year thereafter shall be other than the
18 maximum rate unless and until the employer's account
19 has been chargeable with benefits throughout the
20 thirty-six consecutive calendar month period ending on
21 December 31 of the preceding calendar year, except

6 chargeable throughout a lesser period but in no event
7 less than the twelve consecutive calendar month period

9 For the calendar years 1985 through 1991, the

6 benefits throughout the twelve consecutive calendar
7 month period ending on December 31 of the preceding
8 calendar year;
9 (3) Any amount credited to this State under section 903 of
10 the Social Security Act[—] of 1935, as amended, which
11 has been appropriated for expenses of administration,

17 shall be excluded from the fund for the purposes of
18 this paragraph. No employer's rate shall be reduced

5 (4) If, when any classification of employers is to be made
6 (which may be after the commencement of the period for
7 which the classification is to be made), the

9 any report required in connection therewith or has
10 filed a report that the department finds incorrect or
11 insufficient, the department shall notify the employer
12 thereof by mail addressed to the employer's last known
13 address. Unless the employer files the report or a

15 within fifteen days after the mailing of the notice,
16 the maximum rate of contributions shall be payable by
17 the employer for the period for which the contribution
18 rate is to be fixed. Effective January 1, 1987, the
19 director, for excusable failure, may redetermine the
