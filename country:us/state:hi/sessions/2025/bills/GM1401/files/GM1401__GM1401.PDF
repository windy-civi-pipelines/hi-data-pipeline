STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS TO HOUSE BILL NO. 958
Honorable Members
Thirty-Third Legislature
State of Hawaii
Pursuant to Section 16 of Article III of the Constitution of the State of
Hawaii, I am returning herewith, without my approval. House Bill No. 958, entitled "A Bill
for an Act Relating to Transportation."
The purposes of this bill are to provide additional clarity to existing law and
reinforce statewide education efforts to promote safe and responsible electrical bicycle
use. Among other things, the bill prohibits operating a "high-speed electric device" on a
public roadway and other designated areas.
This bill is objectionable because the definition of "high-speed electric
device" and the prohibition of such devices on public roadways may be construed to
include electric motor vehicles.
The bill defines "high-speed electric device" as "any device with a motor
exceeding seven hundred fifty watts and capable of speeds over twenty-eight miles per
hour." There are exceptions for mopeds and motorcycles, but not for electric motor
vehicles, which othenwise fall within this definition. An earlier version of the bill limited
the definition to two-wheeled electric devices, but the definition was subsequently
amended from "a two-wheeled electric device" to "any device," without adding electric
motor vehicles to the exclusions provided for mopeds and motorcycles.
Moreover, there is no definition of "device" in the current law that would
preclude electric motor vehicles from being subject to the requirements of this bill.
Instead, "vehicles" under section 291C-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS), are broadly
defined as “devices” for transporting people and property. Consequently, under the
plain language of this bill and chapter 291C, HRS, an electric motor vehicle would be
considered a "high-speed electric device" and therefore prohibited from being operated

on public roadways if this bill were to become law.
While it appears that the failure to exempt electric motor vehicles from the
prohibition in the bill was inadvertent, it would nevertheless cause confusion about the
legality of using electric motor vehicles on the State's public roadways and conflict with
my commitment to reducing greenhouse gases.
For the foregoing reasons, I am returning House Bill No. 958 without my
approval.
Respectfully,
JOSH GREEN, M.D.
Governor of Hawaii
