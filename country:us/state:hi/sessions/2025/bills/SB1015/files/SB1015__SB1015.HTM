Section 1:
SB1015 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1015 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to transportation. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that in Navahine v. Hawaii Department of Transportation, CIV.NO.ICCV-22-0000631 (Hawaii Cir.Ct.), the court denied a motion to dismiss plaintiffs' lawsuit asserting that transportation fuels violate the Hawaii State Constitution's public trust doctrine and right to a clean and healthy environment.  Emissions reduction in transportation depend on the driving public choosing a one hundred per cent clean energy transportation system by 2045, as stated by the Hawaii state energy office. The legislature further finds that while a majority of the public is already concerned about the public health crisis and impacts on climate change driven by fossil fuel consumption, many consider it a low priority to address immediately.  The legislature recognizes that "climate warming labels" are a comprehensive public education tool that addresses the pivotal role of the public in carrying out the State's stated emissions reduction goals in transportation.  Increasing consumer knowledge of fossil fuel harms is a necessary pretext for accelerating the transition towards one hundred per cent clean transportation. The legislature additionally finds that North Vancouver British Columbia, Cambridge Massachusetts, and Sweden have all instituted "climate warming labels" and have found that public knowledge of the effects of fossil fuel consumption on public health and the environment has grown significantly. Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to require self-service stations to put labels on gas dispensing equipment that advise consumers on the effects of fossil fuel consumption on human health and the environment. SECTION 2. Chapter 486H, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§486H-    Retail service stations; dispensing equipment; warning labels.  (a)  Each self-service gas pump dispensing equipment in a retail service station shall bear or have attached, a plainly written or printed warning label in the English language that provides consumers with information about the impact of fossil fuel consumption.  The label shall state that burning gasoline, diesel, and ethanol has major consequences on human health and the environment, including its contribution to climate change. (b) The text, image, or graphics of the warning label in subsection (a) shall be subject to approval by the commission." SECTION 3. New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 4. This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2025. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: PUC; Retail Service Stations; Gas Dispensing Equipment; Warning Labels; Health; Environment; Climate Change Description: Requires self-service stations to put Public Utilities Commission-approved labels on gas dispensing equipment to advise consumers on the effects of fossil fuel consumption to human health and the environment.
