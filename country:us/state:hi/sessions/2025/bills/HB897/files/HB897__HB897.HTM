(b) The general purposes of this compact are to: (1)  Facilitate the states' responsibility to protect public health and safety; (2)  Ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation; (3)  Facilitate the exchange of information between party states in the areas of nurse regulation, investigation and adverse actions; (4)  Promote compliance with the laws governing the practice of nursing in each jurisdiction; (5)  Invest all party states with the authority to hold a nurse accountable for meeting all state practice laws in the state in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered through the mutual recognition of party state licenses; (6)  Decrease redundancies in the consideration and issuance of nurse licenses; and (7)  Provide opportunities for interstate practice by nurses who meet uniform licensure requirements.

GENERAL PROVISIONS AND JURISDICTION (a)  A multistate license to practice registered or licensed practical/vocational nursing issued by a home state to a resident in that state will be recognized by each party state as authorizing a nurse to practice as a registered nurse (RN) or as a licensed practical/vocational nurse (LPN/VN), under a multistate licensure privilege, in each party state. (b) A state must implement procedures for considering the criminal history records of applicants for initial multistate license or licensure by endorsement.  The procedures shall include the submission of fingerprints or other biometric-based information by applicants for the purpose of obtaining an applicant's criminal history record information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the agency responsible for retaining that state's criminal records.

ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES INVESTED IN PARTY STATE LICENSING BOARDS (a)  In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a licensing board shall have the authority to: (1)  Take adverse action against a nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice within that party state; provided that: (A)  Only the home state shall have the power to take adverse action against a nurse's license issued by the home state; and (B)  For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state licensing board shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if the conduct had occurred within the home state.  In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action; (2)  Issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on a nurse's authority to practice within that party state; (3)  Complete any pending investigations of a nurse who changes primary state of residence during the course of investigation.  The licensing board shall also have the authority to take appropriate action(s) and shall promptly report the conclusions of the investigations to the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system.  The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the new home state of any actions; (4)  Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses, and the production of evidence.  Subpoenas issued by a licensing board in a party state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another party state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it.  The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located; (5)  Obtain and submit, for each nurse licensure applicant, fingerprint or other biometric-based information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for criminal background checks, receive the results of the Federal Bureau of Investigation record search on criminal background checks and use the results in making licensure decisions; (6)  If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected nurse the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that nurse; and (7)  Take adverse action based on the factual findings of the remote state, provided that the licensing board follows its own procedures for taking adverse action. (b)  If adverse action is taken by the home state against a nurse's multistate license, the nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice in all other party states shall be deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the multistate license.  All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a nurse's multistate license shall include a statement that the nurse's multistate licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during the pendency of the order. (c)  Nothing in this compact shall override a party state's decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action.  The home state licensing board shall deactivate the multistate licensure privilege under the multistate license of any nurse for the duration of the nurse's participation in an alternative program. ARTICLE VI. COORDINATED LICENSURE INFORMATION SYSTEM AND EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION (a)  All party states shall participate in a coordinated licensure information system of all licensed registered nurses (RNs) and licensed practical/vocational nurses (LPNs/VNs).  This system will include information on the licensure and disciplinary history of each nurse, as submitted by party states, to assist in the coordination of nurse licensure and enforcement efforts.

(g) Any information contributed to the coordinated licensure information system that is subsequently required to be expunged by the laws of the party state contributing that information, shall also be expunged from the coordinated licensure information system. (h) The compact administrator of each party state shall furnish a uniform data set to the compact administrator of each other party state, which shall include, at a minimum: (1)  Identifying information; (2)  Licensure data; (3)  Information related to alternative program participation; and (4)  Other information that may facilitate the administration of this compact, as determined by commission rules.

(b) Default, Technical Assistance and Termination. (1)  If the commission determines that a party state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall: (A)  Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other party states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default or any other action to be taken by the commission; and (B)  Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default; (2)  If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state's membership in this compact may be terminated upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the administrators, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination.  A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default; (3)  Termination of membership in this compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the governor of the defaulting state and to the executive officer of the defaulting state's licensing board and each of the party states; (4)  A state whose membership in this compact has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination; (5)  The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or whose membership in this compact has been terminated unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state; and (6)  The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the commission has its principal offices.

(d) Enforcement. (1)  The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact; (2)  By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the commission has its principal offices against a party state that is in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of this compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws.  The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.  In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees; and (3)  The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission.  The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.

GENERAL PROVISIONS AND JURISDICTION (a)  A multistate license to practice registered or licensed practical/vocational nursing issued by a home state to a resident in that state will be recognized by each party state as authorizing a nurse to practice as a registered nurse (RN) or as a licensed practical/vocational nurse (LPN/VN), under a multistate licensure privilege, in each party state. (b) A state must implement procedures for considering the criminal history records of applicants for initial multistate license or licensure by endorsement.  The procedures shall include the submission of fingerprints or other biometric-based information by applicants for the purpose of obtaining an applicant's criminal history record information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the agency responsible for retaining that state's criminal records.

(b)  If adverse action is taken by the home state against a nurse's multistate license, the nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice in all other party states shall be deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the multistate license.  All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a nurse's multistate license shall include a statement that the nurse's multistate licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during the pendency of the order. (c)  Nothing in this compact shall override a party state's decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action.  The home state licensing board shall deactivate the multistate licensure privilege under the multistate license of any nurse for the duration of the nurse's participation in an alternative program. ARTICLE VI. COORDINATED LICENSURE INFORMATION SYSTEM AND EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION (a)  All party states shall participate in a coordinated licensure information system of all licensed registered nurses (RNs) and licensed practical/vocational nurses (LPNs/VNs).  This system will include information on the licensure and disciplinary history of each nurse, as submitted by party states, to assist in the coordination of nurse licensure and enforcement efforts.

(1)  Each party state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate this compact's purposes and intent; and (2)  The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding that may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the commission, and shall have standing to intervene in a proceeding for all purposes.  Failure to provide service of process in a proceeding to the commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact or promulgated rules. (b) Default, Technical Assistance and Termination. (1)  If the commission determines that a party state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall: (A)  Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other party states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default or any other action to be taken by the commission; and (B)  Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default; (2)  If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state's membership in this compact may be terminated upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the administrators, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination.  A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default; (3)  Termination of membership in this compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the governor of the defaulting state and to the executive officer of the defaulting state's licensing board and each of the party states; (4)  A state whose membership in this compact has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination; (5)  The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or whose membership in this compact has been terminated unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state; and (6)  The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees. (c) Dispute Resolution. (1)  Upon request by a party state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among party states and between party and non-party states; (2)  The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as appropriate; (3)  In the event the commission cannot resolve disputes among party states arising under this compact: (A)  The party states may submit the issues in dispute to an arbitration panel, which will be composed of individuals appointed by the compact administrator in each of the affected party states and an individual mutually agreed upon by the compact administrators of all the party states involved in the dispute; and (B)  The decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be final and binding. (d) Enforcement. (1)  The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact; (2)  By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the commission has its principal offices against a party state that is in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of this compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws.  The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.  In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees; and (3)  The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission.  The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.
