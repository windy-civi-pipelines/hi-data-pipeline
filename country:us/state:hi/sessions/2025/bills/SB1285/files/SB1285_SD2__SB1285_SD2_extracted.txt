Section 1:
SB1285 SD2 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1285 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO HIGHWAY SAFETY. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the amount of traffic fatalities is greatly reflected in the legal limit of blood alcohol concentration.  Driving with a blood alcohol concentration of even .05 grams of alcohol per one hundred milliliters of blood can impair driving ability and lead to a greater chance of a fatal crash.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported in 2022 that thirty-two per cent of all traffic crash fatalities in the United States involved drunk drivers.  Over fifty countries around the world have a legal limit of .05 grams blood alcohol concentration including Belgium, Demark, Egypt, France, the Philippines, and more. Studies provide evidence that lower thresholds for driving under the influence citations help prevent crashes and deaths especially between .05 grams and .08 grams blood alcohol concentration, as people are more conscientious and wait longer before driving. The legislature further finds that the blood alcohol concentration of .05 grams is beneficial for restaurant and bar business sales.  As a result of increased precaution with lower blood alcohol limits, people feel they can freely order more drinks on average than they otherwise would because they may spend more time at restaurants and bars, and more frequently plan to arrange designated drivers, rideshares, or alternate transportation. The legislature further notes that there is significant evidence at both the international and national level in countless cities, states, and countries that lowering the legal limit of blood alcohol concentration reduces drunk driving.  In 1980, more than half of the United States had a legal limit of .10 grams blood alcohol concentration, including Hawaii.  In 2000, only nineteen states had lowered their blood alcohol concentration limits to .08 grams, which became the new national standard four years later.  A study funded by the National Institutes of Health found that between 1982 and 2014, states lowering their blood alcohol concentration limits to .08 grams reduced annual fatalities by 10.4 per cent. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Increase safety and reduce deaths on Hawaii's roadways due to alcohol consumption by establishing a new traffic infraction for those driving with a blood alcohol concentration between .05 grams and .079 grams; (2)  Establish a process to automatically suspend the license of a person arrested for driving under the influence; (3)  Allow a person whose license is automatically suspended for driving under the influence to contest the suspension; (4)  Amending the administrative process at the administrative driver's license revocation office; and (5)  Require the department of the attorney general to report certain information on cases relating to certain offenses related to impaired driving. SECTION 2.  Chapter 291E, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part IV to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§291E-    Operating a vehicle while impaired.  (a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle while impaired if the person operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration equal to or greater than .05 grams but less than .08 grams of alcohol per one hundred milliliters or cubic centimeters of blood, or .05 grams but less than .08 grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of breath pursuant to proceedings under chapter 291D. (b) A person committing the offense of operating a vehicle while impaired shall be fined $          , in addition to any other civil or administrative penalty. (c) The penalty established under this section shall be in addition to any other penalty established and imposed under this chapter." SECTION 3.  Section 287-20, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows: "(a) Whenever a driver's license has been suspended or revoked: (1)  Pursuant to section 291E-65 or part III of chapter 291E, except as provided in section [291E-41(f);] 291E-41(e); (2)  Upon a conviction of any offense pursuant to law, except where the conduct giving rise to the instant offense is also a violation of part III of chapter 291E and a requirement to furnish and maintain proof of financial responsibility has already been imposed pursuant to that part; or (3)  In the case of minors, pursuant to part V of chapter 571, the license shall not at any time thereafter be issued to the person whose license has been suspended or revoked, nor shall the person thereafter operate a motor vehicle, unless and until the person has furnished and thereafter maintains proof of financial responsibility; provided that this section shall not apply to a license suspended or revoked pursuant to section 291E-61(b)(1) or 291E-64(b)(1), any conviction of a moving violation, any administrative license suspension pursuant to chapter 291A, or the first conviction within a five-year period for driving without a valid motor vehicle insurance policy. This subsection shall not apply to a suspension or revocation of a provisional license under section 286-102.6(d)." SECTION 4.  Section 291E-31, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§291E-31 Notice of administrative revocation; effect.  As used in this part, the notice of administrative revocation: (1)  Establishes that the respondent's license and privilege to operate a vehicle in the State or on or in the waters of the State shall be terminated: (A)  Thirty days after the date the notice of administrative revocation is issued in the case of an alcohol related offense; (B)  Forty-four days after the date the notice of administrative revocation is issued in the case of a drug related offense; or (C)  Such later date as is established by the director under section 291E-38[, if the director administratively revokes the respondent's license and privilege;]; (2)  Establishes the date on which administrative revocation proceedings against the respondent were initiated; (3)  Serves as a temporary permit, if applicable, to operate a vehicle as provided in section 291E-33; and (4)  Notifies the respondent that the respondent shall obtain an ignition interlock permit and keep an ignition interlock device installed and operating in any vehicle the respondent operates during the revocation period if the respondent had a valid license at the time of the arrest."
