SB1285 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1285 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT Relating to HighWay Safety. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the amount of traffic fatalities is greatly reflected in the legal limit of blood alcohol concentration.  Driving with a blood alcohol concentration of even .05 grams of alcohol per one hundred milliliters of blood can impair driving ability and lead to a greater chance of a fatal crash.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported in 2022 that thirty-two per cent of all traffic crash fatalities in the United States involved drunk drivers.  Over fifty countries around the world have a legal limit of .05 grams blood alcohol concentration including Belgium, Demark, Egypt, France, the Philippines, and more. Studies provide evidence that lower thresholds for driving under the influence citations help prevent crashes and deaths especially between .05 grams and .08 grams blood alcohol concentration, as people are more conscientious and wait longer before driving. The legislature further finds that the blood alcohol concentration of .05 grams is beneficial for restaurant and bar business sales.  As a result of increased precaution with lower blood alcohol limits, people feel they can freely order more drinks on average than they otherwise would because they may spend more time at restaurants and bars, and more frequently plan to arrange designated drivers, rideshares, or alternate transportation. The legislature further notes that there is significant evidence at both the international and national level in countless cities, states, and countries that lowering the legal limit of blood alcohol concentration reduces drunk driving.  In 1980, more than half of the United States had a legal limit of .10 grams blood alcohol concentration including Hawaii.  In 2000, only nineteen states had lowered their blood alcohol concentration limits to .08 grams, which became the new national standard four years later.  A study funded by the National Institutes of Health found that between 1982 and 2014, states lowering their blood alcohol concentration limits to .08 grams reduced annual fatalities by 10.4 per cent. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Increase safer transportation and reduce deaths on Hawaii's roadways due to alcohol consumption by establishing a new traffic fine for those driving with a blood alcohol concentration between .05 grams and .079 grams; and (2)  Prohibit a prosecuting attorney from dismissing a charge for violation of operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant in exchange for a defendant's agreement to a change of plea on a lesser charge. SECTION 2.  Chapter 291E, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part IV to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§291E-    Operating a vehicle while impaired.  (a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle while impaired if the person operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration equal to or greater than .05 grams but less than .08 grams of alcohol per one hundred milliliters or cubic centimeters of blood, or .05 grams but less than .08 grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of breath. (b) A person committing the offense of operating a vehicle while impaired shall be fined $          . (c) The penalty established under this section shall be in addition to any other penalty established and imposed under this chapter. (d)  The department of transportation may implement administrative actions against any person who violates this section." SECTION 3.  Section 291E-61, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant.  (a)  A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: (1)  While under the influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair the person's normal mental faculties or ability to care for the person and guard against casualty; (2)  While under the influence of any drug that impairs the person's ability to operate the vehicle in a careful and prudent manner; (3)  With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of breath; or (4)  With .08 or more grams of alcohol per one hundred milliliters or cubic centimeters of blood. (b)  A person committing the offense of operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant shall be sentenced without possibility of probation or suspension of sentence as follows: (1)  Except as provided in paragraph (4), for the first offense, or any offense not preceded within a ten-year period by a conviction for an offense under this section or section 291E-4(a): (A)  A fourteen-hour minimum substance abuse rehabilitation program, including education and counseling, or other comparable programs deemed appropriate by the court; (B)  Revocation of license to operate a vehicle for no less than one year and no more than eighteen months; (C)  Installation during the revocation period of an ignition interlock device on all vehicles operated by the person; (D)  Any one or more of the following: (i)  Seventy-two hours of community service work; (ii)  [No] Not less than forty-eight hours and [no] not more than five days of imprisonment; or (iii)  A fine of [no] not less than $250 and [no] not more than $1,000; (E)  A surcharge of $25 to be deposited into the neurotrauma special fund; and (F)  A surcharge, if the court so orders, or up to $25 to be deposited into the trauma system special fund; (2)  For an offense that occurs within ten years of a prior conviction for an offense under this section: (A)  A substance abuse program of at least thirty-six hours, including education and counseling, or other comparable programs deemed appropriate by the court; (B)  Revocation of license to operate a vehicle for [no] not less than two years and [no] not more than three years; (C)  Installation during the revocation period of an ignition interlock device on all vehicles operated by the person; (D)  Either one of the following: (i)  [No] Not less than two hundred forty hours of community service work; or (ii)  [No] Not less than five days and [no] not more than thirty days of imprisonment, of which at least forty-eight hours shall be served consecutively; (E)  A fine of [no] not less than $1,000 and [no] not more than $3,000, to be deposited into the drug and alcohol toxicology testing laboratory special fund; (F)  A surcharge of $25 to be deposited into the neurotrauma special fund; and (G)  A surcharge of up to $50, if the court so orders, to be deposited into the trauma system special fund; (3)  In addition to a sentence imposed under paragraphs (1) and (2), any person eighteen years of age or older who is convicted under this section and who operated a vehicle with a passenger, in or on the vehicle, who was younger than fifteen years of age, shall be sentenced to an additional mandatory fine of $500 and an additional mandatory term of imprisonment of forty-eight hours; provided that the total term of imprisonment for a person convicted under this paragraph shall not exceed the maximum term of imprisonment provided in paragraph (1) or (2), as applicable.  Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), the revocation period for a person sentenced under this paragraph shall be [no] not less than two years; (4)  In addition to a sentence imposed under paragraph (1), for a first offense under this section, or an offense not preceded within a ten-year period by a conviction for an offense, any person who is convicted under this section and was a highly intoxicated driver at the time of the subject incident shall be sentenced to an additional mandatory term of imprisonment for forty-eight consecutive hours and an additional mandatory revocation period of six months; provided that the total term of imprisonment for a person convicted under this paragraph shall not exceed the maximum term of imprisonment provided in paragraph (1).
