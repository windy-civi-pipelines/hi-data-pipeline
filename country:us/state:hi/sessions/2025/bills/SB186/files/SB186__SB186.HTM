Section 1:
SB186 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 186 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to motor carrier vehicles. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the requirements for motor carrier vehicle inspections are ineffective and inconsistently applied. The costs of overseeing and enforcing the inspections are not justified by the inspections' benefits.  Vehicle component failure is a factor in a very small percentage of motor vehicle accidents, and many states have eliminated inspection requirements without increased accidents or injuries.  In Hawaii, the department of transportation found that alcohol, speed, and distracted driving are leading causes of fatal traffic accidents in the State, rather than causes related to vehicle condition. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to repeal the inspection requirements for motor carrier vehicles. SECTION 2.  Section 286-26, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (h) to read as follows: "(h)  This section shall not apply to: (1)  Any motor vehicle that is covered by part XI, governing safety of motor carrier vehicle operation and equipment; [provided that the rules adopted pursuant to part IA impose standards of inspection at least as strict as those imposed under subsection (g) and that certification is required at least as often as provided in subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d);] (2)  Aircraft servicing vehicles that are being used exclusively on lands set aside to the department of transportation for airport purposes; and (3)  Tractor trucks, forklifts, and top picks being used as marine terminal equipment temporarily moving in or between terminals at: (A)  Sand Island and along Sand Island Parkway and Sand Island Access Road; (B)  Kalanianaole Avenue between Kuhio Street and Kahanu Street, abutting Hilo Harbor; (C)  Kawaihae-Mahukona Road abutting Kawaihae Harbor; (D)  East Kaahumanu Avenue between Hobron Avenue and Kane Street, abutting Kahului Harbor; and (E)  Waipaa Road abutting Nawiliwili Harbor." SECTION 3.  Section 286-202, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§286-202  General duties and powers of the director.  The general duties and powers of the director shall be: (1)  To establish rules promoting the safety of operations, motor vehicle and equipment of motor carriers; provided that the maximum hours of service to be performed by an operator of a motor carrier vehicle shall be determined by the director based on conditions existing in the State or in particular sections of the State and shall be compatible with those prescribed by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety regulations of the United States Department of Transportation[.]; (2)  To coordinate the various motor carrier safety programs in the State including the formulation of statewide standards as necessary[.]; (3)  To develop and implement, on a priority basis, a recordkeeping and information system for the motor carrier safety program[.]; (4)  To develop standards relating to the qualification of motor carrier vehicle drivers[.]; (5)  To establish standards for continuous driver training and periodic evaluation of the driver performance of motor carrier vehicle drivers[.]; [(6)  To establish standards for motor carrier vehicle safety inspection, motor carrier vehicle inspection stations, and motor carrier vehicle inspection personnel. (7)] (6) To revise and update the standards relating to motor carrier vehicle maintenance and establish a system for the enforcement of such standards[.]; [(8)] (7) To develop the standards for size and weight of vehicles, including motor carrier vehicles, pursuant to chapter 291[.]; [(9)] (8)  To establish standards for the issuance of special permits to carry oversized and overweight loads on the highway[.]; [(10)] (9)  To establish standards for the transportation of hazardous materials on the highways[.]; [(11)] (10) To develop comprehensive rules governing the modification of motor carrier vehicles which will at any time be operated upon the highway[.]; [(12)] (11)  To review and approve all plans and specifications for construction in the State or modification of motor carrier vehicles which will at any time be operated upon the highway[.]; [(13)] (12)  To adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 necessary for the purposes of this part[.]; and [(14)] (13)  To investigate all motor carrier vehicle accidents under this part resulting in death of a human being or other accidents as the director determines necessary to advance the motor carrier safety program." SECTION 4.  Section 286-215, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§286-215 Fees and charges.  The director shall establish fair and reasonable fees for applications for approval of plans and specifications for construction or modification of a motor vehicle or class of motor vehicles in Hawaii which will at any time be operated upon the highways as provided in section [286‑202(12).] 286-202(11)." SECTION 5.  Section 286-209, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is repealed. ["§286-209 Safety inspection of motor carrier vehicles.  (a) Motor carrier vehicles, including but not limited to trucks, truck-tractors, semitrailers, trailers, or pole trailers, having a gross vehicle weight rating of more than ten thousand pounds, motor carrier vehicles having a gross vehicle weight rating of ten thousand pounds or less which transport passengers in the furtherance of a commercial enterprise, including car rental transport vehicles, and motor carrier vehicles used in transporting material found by the United States Secretary of Transportation to be hazardous under 49 U.S.C. section 5103 and transported in a quantity requiring placarding under 49 C.F.R., subtitle B, chapter I, subchapter C, shall be inspected and certified annually.
