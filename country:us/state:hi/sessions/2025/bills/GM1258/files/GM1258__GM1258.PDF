THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the Center for
2 Cultural and Technical Interchange Between East and West Act of
3 1960, Public Law 86-472, authorized the establishment in Hawaii
4 of a center for cultural and technical interchange between East
5 and West, and Act 82, Session Laws of Hawaii 1975 (Act 82),
6 established an educational non-profit public corporation, the
7 Center for Cultural and Technical Interchange Between East and
8 West, Inc., better known and referred to as the "East-West
9 Center", to administer and operate the center. Act 82 specifies
10 the purposes of the East-West Center, which include, among other
11 things, the promotion of better relations and understanding
12 between the United States and the nations of the East through
13 the administration and operation of the East-West Center as an
14 educational institution operating in furtherance of the
15 objectives of Public Law 86-472 and the promotion, among the
16 nations of the East and West, of the use of the East-West Center
17 by qualified persons for cooperative study, training, and
2025-2881 SB1578 CDl SMA.docx

C.D. 1
1 research in matters of East-West significance, thus leading to
2 better relations and understanding as to such matters.
3 The legislature further finds that the East-West Center has
4 become a pivotal institution in fostering understanding and
5 cooperation between the United States and the nations of Asia
6 and the Pacific. Hawaii's unique geographical location and
7 multicultural heritage make it an ideal location for promoting
8 international relations, particularly within the Asia-Pacific
9 region. For over six decades, the East-West Center has
10 significantly contributed to the State's role as a bridge
11 between the East and West, enhancing the State's position in
12 international affairs.
The legislature further finds that the East-West center's
14 programs in research, education, and exchange have directly
15 benefited the State's economy, culture, and diplomatic
16 relations. While the federal government has provided
17 significant funding to the East-West center, this federal
18 support has fluctuated over the years. The legislature
19 recognizes that the center would benefit from regular,
20 predictable state resources to support the development of
21 programs and initiatives that align with the State's strategic
2025-2881 SB1578 CDl SMA.docx 2

S.B. NO.
C.D. 1
1 goals in international relations, education, and economic
2 development.
3 The legislature finds that the East-West center has served
4 and continues to serve a public purpose of promoting better
S relations and understanding between the United States and the
6 nations of the East and that granting authorization to the
7 East-West center to receive appropriations of state funds exempt
8 from the requirements of chapter 42F, Hawaii Revised Statutes,
9 complies with the public purpose requirement of article VII,
10 section 4, of the Hawaii State Constitution.
11 The legislature further finds that strong sister-state,
12 sister-school, and similar relationships benefit the State's
13 businesses and economy, improve access to flights and
14 transportation, expand high school and college student
15 educational exchanges, broaden access to Pacific culture and
16 arts, preserve the State's relationships to the places of origin
17 of its immigrant communities, and spur sub-national government
18 collaborations to address common priorities, including the
19 eradication of invasive species, promotion of economic
20 development, advancement of clean energy, and preservation of
21 peace between nations. Further, it is appropriate for the State

C.D. 1
1 to explore and take advantage of additional ways that Hawaii can
2 benefit from international partnerships, including generating
3 revenue abroad similar to many other jurisdictions. For example,
4 hosting facilities abroad for local farmers and retailers to more
5 easily sell Hawaii products in key markets, or investing in
6 projects that generate a return, could create revenue to support
7 Hawaii programs and services without additional expense to local
8 taxpayers.
9 The legislature also finds that international relations
10 across the Pacific have been rapidly changing. Additionally,
11 previous generations of the State's key community, business, and
12 government leaders who have carefully fostered and maintained
13 these important relationships are retiring or passing on. In
14 order for residents to continue to benefit from the State's
15 international ties, and for Hawaii to take advantage of
16 international business and revenue opportunities abroad, as so
17 many other jurisdictions currently do, it is critical that the
18 State adjust its engagement strategy, ensure continuity with its
19 sister-state communities and partners, and plan for the future.
20 Therefore, the legislature finds that in celebration of the
21 fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the East-West
2025-2881 SB1578 GDI SMA.docx z

C.D. 1
1 center, the State must update its international engagement strategy
2 and reaffirm its commitment to building and maintaining the
3 international partnerships that have benefitted the State over
4 the years so they can continue to benefit local residents for
5 generations to come.
6 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
7 (1) Establish the official designation of the East-West
8 center as the center for cultural and technical
9 interchange between East and West, Inc., and exempt
10 state fund appropriations to the East-West center from
11 chapter 42F, Hawaii Revised Statutes;
12 (2) Rename the Hawaii sister-state committee as the Hawaii
13 sister-state and international partnerships commission
14 and amends its functions and membership;
15 (3) Require the office of international affairs to provide

1 partnerships and other partnerships that promote and
2 enrich the people, cultures, environments, and
3 economies of the State and its international partners,
4 generate revenue for the State, and buy property; and
S (5) Appropriate funds.
6 SECTION 2. Chapter 201, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
7 amended by adding a new section to part I to be appropriately
8 designated and to read as follows:
9 ”§201- East-West center. (a) The official designation
10 of the East-West center shall be the center for cultural and
11 technical interchange between East and West, Inc.
12 (b) The gualifying standards and conditions related to the

16 if the center for cultural and technical interchange between
17 East and West, Inc, contracts with a recipient or provider, then
18 the gualifying standards, conditions, and other provisions of
19 chapter 42F shall apply to the recipient or provider and the
20 contract.
