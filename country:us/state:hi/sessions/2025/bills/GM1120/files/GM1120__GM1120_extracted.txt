Aloha President Kouchi, Speaker Nakamura, and Members of the Legislature:

THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO SEX TRAFFICKING.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that sex trafficking is a
2 form of modern-day slavery. According to a 2018 report
3 published by Arizona State University and the Hawaii state
4 commission on the status of women, one out of every eleven adult
5 male residents of Hawaii are online sex shoppers. The report
6 also estimated that there were 74,362 potential sex buyers in
7 Hawaii. Moreover, Imua Alliance, a victim service provider for
8 survivors of sex trafficking and sexual violence, estimates that
9 one hundred fifty establishments participate in the commercial
10 sex trade in the State, increasing the high risk for sex
11 trafficking. During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, a
12 service provider for sex trafficking victims in Hawaii reported
13 seeing a three hundred per cent increase in demand for victim
14 services.
15 The legislature additionally finds that Native Hawaiians
16 and Pacific Islanders are disproportionately overrepresented in
17 the State's sex trafficking survivor population. In a survey
2025-0550 HB HMSO
Page 2
H.B. NO. Ill
1 conducted by the Hawaii state commission on the status of women
2 and Arizona State University, sixty-four per cent of individuals
3 identified as victims of sex trafficking reported at least
4 partial Native Hawaiian ancestry. According to the report,
5 ''[t]he overutilization of Native Hawaiians to meet sex buyer
6 demand may be directly linked to structural economic coercion
7 and vulnerabilities connected to land dispossession, exposure to
8 sexual violence, hypersexualization, incarceration, cultural
9 dislocation, intergenerational trauma, mental and emotional
10 distress, racism, poverty, and ongoing inequities."
11 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to support
12 survivors of sex trafficking by:
13 (1) Authorizing civil claims to be made against a person,
14 business, business owner, or business operator that
15 profits from sexual exploitation or sex trafficking;
16 and
17 (2) Extending the statute of limitations for civil claims
18 related to sexual exploitation or sex trafficking to
19 ten years.

21 amended by amending its title to read as follows:
