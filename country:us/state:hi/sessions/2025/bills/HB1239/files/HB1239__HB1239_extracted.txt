HB1239 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1239 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to independent legal counsel. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Congress, through the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920, as amended (Hawaiian Homes Commission Act), set aside lands to be used for the benefit of native Hawaiians.  As required by the Admission Act and as a compact with the United States, the State of Hawaii and the people of Hawaii adopted the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act as a provision of the Hawaii State Constitution, and agreed to faithfully carry out the spirit of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act for the rehabilitation of the Hawaiian race.  These trust responsibilities remain to this day.
