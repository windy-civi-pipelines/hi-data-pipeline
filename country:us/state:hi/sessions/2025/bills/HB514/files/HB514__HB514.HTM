Section 1:
HB514 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 514 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to wind energy. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that offshore wind power is in the early stages of development in the United States, with numerous state and federal offshore wind energy production targets having been set for the coming years. The legislature also finds the offshore wind development is not a net-gain for every community.  While it is a source of inexhaustible, cost-effective, and clean power, it can also lead to negative environmental, cultural, and socioeconomic impacts. Areas off the coast of Oahu have been subject to unsolicited wind energy lease requests following the establishment of the State's 2045 one hundred per cent renewable energy goal.  In response, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has assessed offshore wind deployment scenarios, while communities targeted by lease requests and studies have typically been vocal in their rejection of proposals. As offshore wind energy grows in adoption and Hawaii considers adding developments to its waters, it is vital to balance the benefits of this energy source with infrastructure capacities and community sentiment. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish an offshore wind energy working group to evaluate suitability and the best means to approach possible offshore wind development projects. SECTION 2.  (a)  There is established an offshore wind energy working group to consider and compile existing data, involve community stakeholders in the conversations regarding offshore wind energy development, consider its suitability for Hawaii, make recommendations regarding possible changes to the State's 2045 renewable energy portfolio, and establish best practices as a clear path forward for the State to follow in setting energy goals and initiating offshore wind energy projects. (b)  The working group shall develop an offshore wind roadmap that defines standards to be considered in the development process for offshore wind energy.  The standards must support: (1)  Effective stakeholder engagement; (2)  Local and regional coastal communities; (3)  The creation of economic opportunities and sustainment of existing local and regional economies; (4)  The creation of an offshore wind energy workforce that is local, trained, housed and equitable; (5)  Protection of cultural resources, with special consideration to the rights, customs, and traditional practices of native Hawaiians; (6)  Protection of the environment; and (7)  The achievement of state energy policy objectives. (c)  In making their recommendations and roadmap, the working group shall consult with industry experts and consider existing reports such as the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's Hawaii Floating Offshore Wind Regional Ports Assessment and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's report on The Cost and Feasibility of Floating Offshore Wind Energy in the Oahu Region. (d)  The working group shall consist of the following individuals: (1)  The chair of the house committee on energy and environmental protection; (2)  The chair of the senate committee on energy and intergovernmental affairs; (3)  The chair of the public utilities commission, or the Chair's designee; (4)  The chief energy officer of the Hawaii state energy office, or the chief energy officer's designee; (5)  The chairperson of the board of land and natural resources, or the chairperson's designee; (6)  The director of the office of planning and sustainable development, or the director's designee; and (7)  The chief executive officer of the office of Hawaiian affairs, or the chief executive officer's designee. (e)  The working group shall invite the following representatives to join the working group: (1)  The director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, or the Director's designee. (2)  A representative of the office of climate change, sustainability and resilience of the city and county of Honolulu, to be selected by the chief resilience officer and executive director of the office of climate change, sustainability and resilience of the city and county of Honolulu; (3)  A representative with familiarity, experience, or expertise in native Hawaiian rights, customs, and traditional practices to be appointed by the governor; (4)  A representative from Hawaiian Electric Company; and (5)  A representative from each community affected by proposed offshore wind lease development to be appointed by the governor. The working group may invite other persons to participate on the working group. (f)  The working group shall select a chairperson from among its members. (g)  The members of the working group shall not be subject to chapter 84, Hawaii Revised Statutes, solely based on their participation on the working group. (h)  Members of the working group shall serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for reasonable expenses, including travel expenses, necessary for the performance of their duties. (i)  The working group shall prepare and submit a report of its findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 2027. SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: Working Group; Offshore Wind Energy; Recommendations; Roadmap Description: Creates an offshore wind energy working group to generate a roadmap to define standards to consider in the developmental process for offshore wind energy.  Requires the working group to submit a report to the legislature prior to the 2027 regular session.
