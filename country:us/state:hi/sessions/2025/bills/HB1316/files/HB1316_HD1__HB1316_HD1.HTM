HB1316 HD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1316 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF LAND AND NATURAL RESOURCES. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the people of Hawaii have significant concerns about the effects of over-tourism, including impacts to the environment, and particularly the proliferation of rental kayaks and stand-up paddleboards statewide.  The legislature further finds that it is beneficial for the residents and natural resources of the State to regulate commercial rentals where a state park itself is the location of the watercraft activity.  The legislature additionally finds that Wailua river state park on Kauai, Kealakekua bay state historic park on Hawaii island, and Ahupuaa O Kahana state park on Oahu are the only navigable waters within a state park. Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to require the registration and numbering of rental vessels before they are provided or offered to the public for transiting the navigable waters of a state park. SECTION 2.  Chapter 184, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§184-     Registration required for rental vessels; registration number; fees.  (a) Beginning January 1, 2026, no person shall provide or offer to provide a rental vessel to the public for transiting the navigable waters of a state park, unless the rental vessel is registered and numbered with the division of state parks of the department in accordance with rules adopted by the department pursuant to chapter 91 or authorized by a special use permit. (b)  Beginning January 1, 2026, every rental vessel provided or offered for rent to the public for transiting the navigable waters of a state park shall have a registration number affixed to the rental vessel. (c)  The department may adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to establish conditions of use for rental vessels transiting the navigable waters of a state park and reasonable fees for the initial registration, annual renewal registration, and ancillary decals of those rental vessels. (d)  As used in this section, "vessel" has the same meaning as in section 200-6 and includes but is not limited to boats, motorboats, houseboats, rowboats, powerboats, jet skis, sailboats, fishing boats, towboats, scows, flatboats, cruisers, motor vessels, ships, barges, tugs, floating cabanas, party boats, charter boats, windsurfers, catamarans, ferryboats, canoes, rafts, kayaks, stand-up paddleboards, or any similar buoyant devices permitting or capable of free flotation." SECTION 3. New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 3000.
