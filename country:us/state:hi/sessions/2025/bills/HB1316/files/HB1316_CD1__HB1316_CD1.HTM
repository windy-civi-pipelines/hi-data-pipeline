The legislature finds that the people of Hawaii have significant concerns about the effects of over-tourism, including impacts to the environment, and particularly the proliferation of rental kayaks and stand-up paddleboards statewide.  The legislature further finds that it is beneficial for the residents and natural resources of the State to regulate commercial rentals where a state park is the location of the watercraft activity.  The legislature additionally finds that Wailua river state park on Kauai, Kealakekua bay state historical park on Hawaii island, and Ahupuaa O Kahana state park on Oahu are the only navigable waters within a state park.

(b)  Beginning January 1, 2026, every rental vessel rented or leased, or offered for rent or lease, to the public for transiting the navigable waters of a state park shall have a registration number affixed to the rental vessel. (c)  The department may adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to establish conditions of use for rental vessels transiting the navigable waters of a state park and reasonable fees for the initial registration, annual renewal registration, and ancillary decals of those rental vessels, to be deposited to the credit of the state parks special fund. (d)  For the purposes of this section, "vessel" has the same meaning as in section 200-6 and includes but is not limited to barges, boats, canoes, catamarans, charter boats, cruisers, ferryboats, fishing boats, flatboats, floating cabanas, houseboats, jet skis, kayaks, motor vessels, motorboats, party boats, powerboats, rafts, rowboats, sailboats, scows, ships, stand-up paddleboards, towboats, tugs, windsurfers, or any similar buoyant devices permitting or capable of free flotation." SECTION 3.  Section 184-3.4, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows: "(a)  There is established within the state treasury a fund to be known as the state parks special fund, into which shall be deposited all proceeds collected by the state parks programs involving park user fees, any leases or concession agreements, any fees collected pursuant to section 184-   , the sale of any article purchased from the department to benefit the state parks programs, or any gifts or contributions; provided that proceeds derived from the operation of Iolani Palace shall be used to supplement its educational and interpretive programs."
