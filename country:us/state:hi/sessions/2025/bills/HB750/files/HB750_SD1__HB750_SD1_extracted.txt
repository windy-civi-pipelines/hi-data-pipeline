Section 1:
HB750 SD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 750 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII S.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE ENVIRONMENT. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1. The legislature finds that solid waste may soon exceed landfill capacity in all of the State's counties. Most waste created in the State is landfilled or incinerated, which places the burden for managing waste on taxpayers, is costly, and creates pollution that is harmful to residents and the environment.  Landfills discharge leachate, a highly toxic fluid that has the potential for leakage that can cause harm to surrounding communities and nearshore and marine environments downslope.  The Waimanalo gulch landfill on Oahu produces around nine thousand eight hundred gallons of leachate per day.  Waste that is incinerated produces air pollutants and toxic ash; this toxic ash is often buried in landfills.  On Oahu, more than four hundred tons of toxic ash are buried in the landfill every day. The legislature finds that the State will benefit from reduced waste production by expanding alternative strategies like reuse, refill, composting, and recycling. The legislature further finds that extended producer responsibility promotes a market-based, circular economy that encourages alternative waste management strategies as well as product design innovations that lead to source reduction of waste.  Extended producer responsibility programs shift responsibility for a product's lifecycle, including end-of-life management, from consumers or governments to producers of the product.  This encourages sustainable product design that leads to less waste and more fully recyclable or reusable products and packaging.  Extended producer responsibility programs also typically reduce the financial burden on government for waste management and lead to better recycling services for residents.  Furthermore, these programs help create local jobs by expanding collection services, local processing of waste, and reuse and refill programs. The legislature finds that extended producer responsibility strategies can be applied to packaging waste as well. Packaging waste is a large part of the waste stream and includes containers for food products, cleaning products, and personal care products, as well as waste associated with shipping and transporting products.  Extended producer responsibility programs for packaging waste exist in Asia, Europe, Canada, and five states across the United States.  Furthermore, several other states are in the process of implementing programs by funding needs assessments, a necessary preliminary step to inform the development of an extended producer responsibility program. The purpose of this part is to: (1)  Clarify the authorized uses of the deposit beverage container deposit special fund to include evaluating and promoting recyclable market development activities; and (2)  Require and appropriate funds for the department of health to conduct a statewide needs assessment and establish an advisory council with relevant stakeholders to determine what would be needed to transition to a more circular system with less waste generation and more reuse, and the necessary infrastructure to sort and locally process recyclable materials through an extended producer responsibility program for packaging materials and paper products. SECTION 2.  Section 342G-104, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows: "(b)  Moneys in the deposit beverage container deposit special fund shall be used to reimburse refund values and pay handling fees to redemption centers.  The department may also use the money to: (1)  Fund administrative, audit, and compliance activities associated with collection and payment of the deposits and handling fees of the deposit beverage container program; (2)  Conduct recycling education and demonstration projects; (3)  [Promote] Evaluate and promote recyclable market development activities; (4)  Support the handling and transportation of the deposit beverage containers to end-markets; (5)  Hire personnel to oversee the implementation of the deposit beverage container program, including permitting and enforcement activities; and (6)  Fund associated office expenses." SECTION 3.  (a) The department of health shall conduct a statewide needs assessment to determine what will be needed to reduce waste generation, increase reuse, improve collection services, and expand local processing of materials through an extended producer responsibility program for packaging materials and paper products. (b)  The needs assessment shall detail the resources required in each county to reduce as much as feasible the packaging materials waste and paper products that the county sends to a landfill or power plant that burns municipal solid waste. Additionally, the needs assessment shall consider the following: (1)  Waste and recycling characterizations, including baseline studies of what is in the waste stream, what is being recycled, what is being composted, and how these vary across local jurisdictions; (2)  Existing collection infrastructure, including: (A)  What materials are being collected and the processes and procedures for collection; (B)  Who currently has access to refuse, recycling, and composting collection services; (C)  How collection services are arranged and funded; and (D)  Improvements in services needed; (3)  Processing and materials recovery facility infrastructure, including: (A)  How collected materials are currently being processed and marketed; (B)  Whether the sorting technology is up to date; (C)  Whether there is sufficient capacity to process the volume of materials; (D)  Opportunities and infrastructure needed for more local processing of materials; and (E)  Costs to implement infrastructure improvements; (4)  Markets, including the state of markets for recovered materials and finished compost; (5)  Education, including the effectiveness of the existing outreach in educating residents; (6)  Levels of contamination in collected packaging materials and organics for composting; (7)  The impact of the composition of packaging materials on the reuse, recyclability, and compostability of packaging materials; (8)  An evaluation of how extended producer responsibility program laws are designed and work in other states and countries; (9)  An evaluation of an appropriate definition of "producer" for an extended producer responsibility program in the State; (10)  Equity and environmental justice, including: (A)  Consideration of how the existing system is operating and how extended producer responsibility could increase equity; and (B)  An assessment of equity issues in education efforts; (11)  Economic impact, including estimates in job development from increased reuse, recycling, and composting; (12)  Environmental benefits from reduction and reuse and local versus off-island materials processing; (13)  How extended producer responsibility can promote upstream improvement, such as source reduction, packaging redesign and optimization, and reduction of packaging materials that are harmful to human health or the environment, and reuse and refill practices, including: (A)  Identifying opportunities for source reduction, reuse, and refill in packaging systems; and (B)  Cost and infrastructure needs to implement these systems; and (14)  Suggested diversion targets and timeline using baseline data from the needs assessment to determine the resources, infrastructure, educational program, and other initiatives needed to reach conservative, moderate, and aggressive waste reduction goal scenarios. (c)  The department of health shall conduct the assessment in consultation with the following stakeholders: (1)  Each county department responsible for waste management; (2)  Global and national producer responsibility organizations, including producer responsibility organizations actively working on reusable packaging systems; (3)  Producers of packaging materials and paper products; (4)  Refuse and recycling collection and processing service providers; (5)  Compost facility operators; (6)  Retailers, including restaurants, wholesalers, and distributors; (7)  Organizations and community groups involved with waste management and waste reduction; and (8)  Environmental and human health scientists; provided that additional stakeholders may be included as the department deems necessary and relevant. (d)  The department of health shall convene an advisory council to review the draft needs assessment and propose recommendations throughout the assessment process.  The advisory council shall include the following members selected or invited by the director of health: (1)  One representative from each county department responsible for waste management; (2)  One representative from a national producer or producer trade association; (3)  One representative from a Hawaii-based producer or producer association; (4)  Two representatives who are experts or operators of reuse, refill, or circular economy systems; (5)  One representative from a Hawaii-based refuse service provider; (6)  One representative from a Hawaii-based recycling collection and processing service provider; (7)  One representative from a Hawaii-based retailer; (8)  One representative from a Hawaii-based restaurant; (9)  One representative from a Hawaii-based wholesaler; (10)  One representative from a Hawaii-based distributor of food products; (11)  Two representatives from Hawaii-based organizations and community groups involved with waste management or relevant environmental advocacy; (12)  One representative who is an environmental or human health scientist; (13)  One representative from a business that manufactures consumer packaged goods for sale in the State; and (14)  One representative from the composting industry. (e)  The department of health shall hold a public hearing to obtain comments on the draft needs assessment. (f)  The department of health shall complete and submit the needs assessment, including any proposed legislation, to the legislature no later than December 31, 2028. (g)  For the purposes of this section: "Packaging materials" includes materials used for the containment, protection, or serving of products, including but not limited to paper, paperboard, cardboard, plastics, glass, or metal, or a mixture of any of these materials.  "Packaging materials" excludes deposit beverage containers included under the Hawaii deposit beverage container program. "Paper products" includes printed materials such as office paper, magazines, newspaper, and junk mail.  "Paper products" does not include bound books. "Refill" means the employment of packaging materials that consumers reuse. "Reuse" means the return of or to return packaging materials to the economic stream for use in the same kind of application intended for the original packaging without changing the original composition of the package, the identity of the product, or the components thereof. PART II SECTION 4.  The legislature finds that Act 151, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022 (Act 151), amended the Electronic Device Recycling and Recovery Act to make wholesale changes to the state electronic waste recycling program.  The purpose of Act 151 included, among other things, expanding the definition of "electronic waste" to cover more electronic devices, establishing manufacturer recycling goals, and requiring manufacturers to pay for convenient recycling options for consumers. However, the changes made through Act 151 have been slow to increase the number of electronic waste collection sites and make recycling electronic waste more convenient for residents of the State.  In addition, in the implementation of Act 151, manufacturers have struggled to comply with all new requirements, especially due to increased weight targets and increased penalties for failing to meet the electronic device collection requirements.  Weight targets have been particularly problematic since the weights of electronic devices have decreased over time, and for that reason, many other states and localities have moved away from using weight requirements. The legislature further finds that incentivizing more permanent electronic waste recycling sites and events and adding certain legacy and peripheral devices to the law will expand recycling access and increase convenience to the general public. Accordingly, the purpose of this part is to amend the Electronic Device Recycling and Recovery Act by: (1)  Allowing manufacturers to coordinate activities directly related to the recycling of covered electronic devices; (2)  Expanding the scope of covered electronic devices to include electronic device peripherals and certain legacy devices; and (3)  Requiring manufacturers to provide free collection service locations for residents of every zip code containing twenty-five thousand or more residents, one on-site collection service location on the island of Molokai, and at least four collection events annually on the county of Hawaii outside of Kona and Hilo. SECTION 5.  Chapter 339D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part IV to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§339D-    Manufacturer coordination.  A manufacturer, a group of manufacturers, or a coordinating body acting in accordance with this part may negotiate, enter into contracts with, collaborate, coordinate, or otherwise conduct business with each other and with any other entity developing, implementing, operating, participating in, or performing any other activities directly related to a plan to recycle covered electronic devices approved pursuant to this part.  The manufacturer, group of manufacturers, and any entity developing, implementing, operating, participating in, or performing any other activities related to a plan to recycle covered electronic devices approved pursuant to this part shall not be subject to damages, liability, or scrutiny under federal antitrust law or chapter 480, regardless of the effects of their actions on competition.  The supervisory activities described in this part are sufficient to confirm that activities of the manufacturers, a group of manufacturers, and any entity developing, implementing, operating, participating in, or performing any other activities related to a manufacturer plan to recycle covered electronic devices that is approved are authorized and actively supervised by the State." SECTION 6.  Section 339D-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended as follows: 1.

(g)  For the purposes of this section: "Packaging materials" includes materials used for the containment, protection, or serving of products, including but not limited to paper, paperboard, cardboard, plastics, glass, or metal, or a mixture of any of these materials.  "Packaging materials" excludes deposit beverage containers included under the Hawaii deposit beverage container program. "Paper products" includes printed materials such as office paper, magazines, newspaper, and junk mail.  "Paper products" does not include bound books. "Refill" means the employment of packaging materials that consumers reuse. "Reuse" means the return of or to return packaging materials to the economic stream for use in the same kind of application intended for the original packaging without changing the original composition of the package, the identity of the product, or the components thereof. PART II SECTION 4.  The legislature finds that Act 151, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022 (Act 151), amended the Electronic Device Recycling and Recovery Act to make wholesale changes to the state electronic waste recycling program.  The purpose of Act 151 included, among other things, expanding the definition of "electronic waste" to cover more electronic devices, establishing manufacturer recycling goals, and requiring manufacturers to pay for convenient recycling options for consumers. However, the changes made through Act 151 have been slow to increase the number of electronic waste collection sites and make recycling electronic waste more convenient for residents of the State.  In addition, in the implementation of Act 151, manufacturers have struggled to comply with all new requirements, especially due to increased weight targets and increased penalties for failing to meet the electronic device collection requirements.  Weight targets have been particularly problematic since the weights of electronic devices have decreased over time, and for that reason, many other states and localities have moved away from using weight requirements. The legislature further finds that incentivizing more permanent electronic waste recycling sites and events and adding certain legacy and peripheral devices to the law will expand recycling access and increase convenience to the general public. Accordingly, the purpose of this part is to amend the Electronic Device Recycling and Recovery Act by: (1)  Allowing manufacturers to coordinate activities directly related to the recycling of covered electronic devices; (2)  Expanding the scope of covered electronic devices to include electronic device peripherals and certain legacy devices; and (3)  Requiring manufacturers to provide free collection service locations for residents of every zip code containing twenty-five thousand or more residents, one on-site collection service location on the island of Molokai, and at least four collection events annually on the county of Hawaii outside of Kona and Hilo. SECTION 5.  Chapter 339D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part IV to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§339D-    Manufacturer coordination.  A manufacturer, a group of manufacturers, or a coordinating body acting in accordance with this part may negotiate, enter into contracts with, collaborate, coordinate, or otherwise conduct business with each other and with any other entity developing, implementing, operating, participating in, or performing any other activities directly related to a plan to recycle covered electronic devices approved pursuant to this part.  The manufacturer, group of manufacturers, and any entity developing, implementing, operating, participating in, or performing any other activities related to a plan to recycle covered electronic devices approved pursuant to this part shall not be subject to damages, liability, or scrutiny under federal antitrust law or chapter 480, regardless of the effects of their actions on competition.  The supervisory activities described in this part are sufficient to confirm that activities of the manufacturers, a group of manufacturers, and any entity developing, implementing, operating, participating in, or performing any other activities related to a manufacturer plan to recycle covered electronic devices that is approved are authorized and actively supervised by the State." SECTION 6.  Section 339D-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended as follows: 1. By amending the definitions of "brand" and "collector" to read: ""Brand" means a symbol, word, or mark that identifies [an] a covered electronic device, rather than any of its components. "Collector" means a person that accepts covered electronic devices for reuse or delivers the devices to a recycler for the purposes of this chapter." 2. By amending the definition of "electronic device" to read: "["Electronic] "Covered electronic device": (1)  Means: (A)  A computer, computer printer, computer monitor, facsimile machine, videocassette recorder, portable digital music player that has memory capability and is battery powered, digital video disc player, digital video disc recorder, router designed for household use, modem designed for household use, or portable computer with a screen size greater than four inches measured diagonally; [and] (B)  Any device that is capable of receiving broadcast, cable, or satellite signals and displaying television or video programing, including any direct view or projection television with a viewable screen of nine inches or larger with display technology based on cathode ray tube, plasma, liquid crystal, digital light processing, liquid crystal on silicon, silicon crystal reflective display, light emitting diode, or similar technology; and (C)  Electronic device peripherals, including: (i)  A keyboard, mouse, or other device sold exclusively for external use with a covered electronic device as a wireless or corded device that provides input into, or output from, a covered electronic device; (ii)  Cords used with a covered electronic device or other electronic device peripheral; (iii)  Power supplies and adapters designed to support a covered electronic device; (iv)  Speakers used with a computer or television and television sound bars; and (v)  Video game consoles; and (2)  Shall not include: (A)  [An] A covered electronic device that is a part of a motor vehicle or any component part of a motor vehicle assembled by or for a motor vehicle manufacturer or franchised dealer, including replacement parts for use in a motor vehicle; (B)  [An] A covered electronic device that is functionally or physically required as a part of a larger piece of equipment designed and intended for use in an industrial, commercial, or medical setting, including diagnostic, monitoring, or control equipment; (C)  [An] A covered electronic device that is contained within a clothes washer, clothes dryer, refrigerator, refrigerator and freezer, microwave oven, conventional oven or range, dishwasher, room air conditioner, dehumidifier, or air purifier; (D)  A telephone of any type including a mobile telephone; or (E)  A global positioning system." 3.

By amending the definitions of "recycler", "recycling", "retailer", and "reuse" to read: ""Recycler" means any person who engages in the recycling of covered electronic devices for the purposes of this chapter. "Recycling" means processing, including disassembling, dismantling, or shredding, covered electronic devices or their components to recover a useable product. "Retailer" means any person who offers covered electronic devices for sale, other than for resale by the purchaser, through any means, including sales outlets, catalogs, or the Internet. "Reuse" means any operation by which [an] a covered electronic device changes ownership and is used for the same purpose for which it was originally purchased." SECTION 7.  Section 339D-23, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§339D-23  Manufacturer responsibility.
