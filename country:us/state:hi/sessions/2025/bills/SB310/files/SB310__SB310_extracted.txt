Section 1:
SB310 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 310 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO TAXATION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Act 247, Session Laws of Hawaii 2005, authorized the counties to adopt a surcharge of up to one-half of one per cent on state tax to support public transportation projects. The law has been subsequently amended, including by Act 1, Special Session Laws of Hawaii 2017, and Act 11, Session Laws of Hawaii 2018,and Act 48, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023, to extend the time period in which a county may adopt and impose the surcharge on state tax.  The law currently authorizes a county that has previously adopted a surcharge on state tax to extend the surcharge through December 31, 2030.  Counties that had not previously adopted a surcharge on state tax had until December 31, 2023, to adopt a surcharge that could be imposed through December 31, 2030.  The legislature concludes that it is appropriate to authorize the counties to permanently adopt and impose a public transportation surcharge, which shall be at a lower rate of one-fourth of one per cent after December 31, 2030. The legislature further finds that a county with a population greater than five hundred thousand is currently restricted to using the surcharge revenues for capital costs of mass transit projects while smaller counties may use their surcharge for other purposes, including operational costs of public transportation systems and housing infrastructure, and that the restrictions on the larger counties should be amended to allow for wider use of the funds. The purpose of this Act is to further amend the county surcharge on state general excise and use taxes by: (1)  Authorizing a county with a pre-existing surcharge on state general excise and use taxes to permanently extend its surcharge to be imposed after December 31, 2030 at a lower rate of one-fourth of one per cent; (2)  Authorizing counties that have not previously adopted an ordinance to establish a surcharge on state general excise and use taxes to establish a surcharge at the rate of one-half of one per cent until December 31, 2030, and thereafter at a rate of one-fourth of one per cent; and (3)  For counties with a population greater than five hundred thousand, authorizing use of surcharge revenues for more than capital costs of mass transit systems, as smaller counties are not restricted to using those revenues only for capital costs of public transportation. SECTION 2.  Section 23-14, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows: "(a) Beginning on September 5, 2017, and ending on December 31, 2031, the auditor, on an annual basis, shall conduct a review of any rapid transportation authority in the State charged with the responsibility of constructing, operating, or maintaining a locally preferred alternative for a mass transit project that receives moneys from a surcharge on state tax established pursuant to section 46-16.8, transient accommodations tax revenues pursuant to section 237D-2(e), or both.  The annual review shall include a review of documents, including but not limited to invoices, contracts, progress reports, and time schedules, to determine that: (1)  Expenditures by the authority comply with the criteria established pursuant to section [46-16.8(f);] 46-16.8(g); and (2)  The authority follows accounting best practices for substantiating its expenditures." SECTION 3. Section 40-81.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended as follows: 1. By amending subsection (a) to read: "(a) Beginning on September 5, 2017, [and ending on December 31, 2031,] the comptroller, upon the request for payment by the rapid transportation authority, shall verify that the authority's invoices for the [capital] costs of a locally preferred alternative for a mass transit project comply with section [46‑16.8(f).] 46‑16.8(g)." 2. By amending subsection (c) to read: "(c) After submission of invoices by the rapid transportation authority for capital costs of a locally preferred alternative for a mass transit project are verified by the comptroller as an acceptable use of funds received pursuant to a surcharge on state tax authorized pursuant to section 46-16.8, the comptroller shall submit a certification statement, including any appropriate supporting documents, to the department of budget and finance for the allocation of funds, if available, pursuant to sections 248-2.7 and 248-2.6(d).  The certification statement shall include, at a minimum, the total amount contained in the invoices for [capital] costs that are verified as an appropriate use of funds pursuant to section 46‑16.8(f)."

The legislature further finds that a county with a population greater than five hundred thousand is currently restricted to using the surcharge revenues for capital costs of mass transit projects while smaller counties may use their surcharge for other purposes, including operational costs of public transportation systems and housing infrastructure, and that the restrictions on the larger counties should be amended to allow for wider use of the funds.
