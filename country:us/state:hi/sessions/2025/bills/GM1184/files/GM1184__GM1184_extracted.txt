Aloha President Kouchi, Speaker Nakamura, and Members of the Legislature:
This is to inform you that on May 27, 2025, the following bill was signed into law:
S.B. NO. 691, S.D. 1, RELATING TO FAMILY COURTS.

THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO FAMILY COURTS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAH:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the United States is
2 the only country in the world that has not fully established a
3 minimum age for juvenile delinquency adjudication, in violation
4 of Article 40 of the United Nations Convention of the Rights of
5 the Child, which requires nations to set a minimum age below
6 which children are deemed incapable of transgressing the
7 criminal law. In the United States, only a bare majority of
8 states have established any minimum age of delinquency
9 adjudication, and most states that have set a minimum age have
10 set it at the low age of ten years old.
11 The legislature further finds that young children under the
12 age of twelve do not have the ability to form mens rea or
13 criminal intent, but should still receive services and treatment
14 when they engage in what would otherwise be delinquent or
15 criminal behavior. These children lack the intellectual
16 capability and maturity to fully understand the consequences of
17 their actions, as well as the proceedings in juvenile court.

1 Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to establish a
2 minimum age of twelve before a child may be adjudicated for any
3 alleged or attempted violation of law.

5 amended to read as follows:

8 original jurisdiction in proceedings:
9 (1) Concerning any person who is at least twelve years old
10 and is alleged to have committed an act before
11 achieving eighteen years of age that would constitute
12 a violation or attempted violation of any federal,

14 of where the violation occurred, jurisdiction may be

16 resides, is living, or is found, or in which the
17 offense is alleged to have occurred;
18 (2) Concerning any child living or found within the
