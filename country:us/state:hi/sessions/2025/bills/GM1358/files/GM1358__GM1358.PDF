THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO WASTE OR DISPOSAL FACILITIES.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the search for a new
2 landfill for the city and county of Honolulu cannot be
3 prioritized over the protection of Oahu's freshwater aquifers.
4 In 2021, approximately twenty thousand gallons of jet fuel
5 leaked from the Red Hill bulk fuel storage facility and
6 contaminated the Pearl Harbor-Hickam water system that serves
7 ninety-three thousand military and civilian customers. The leak
8 also affected the Honolulu board of water supply, and the city
9 and county has shut down three wells that supply fourteen
10 million gallons of water a day to urban Honolulu. The Honolulu
11 board of water supply is in search of new wells that can supply
12 urban Honolulu, which may not be ready until 2025. To protect
13 and preserve freshwater, a new landfill cannot be built inland
14 of underground injection control lines.
15 The legislature further finds that prime agricultural land
16 should be protected, preserved, and reserved for agricultural

1 and related uses. Therefore, a new landfill should not be
2 located on those agricultural lands.
3 The legislature also finds that the city and county of
4 Honolulu is required to relocate the Waimanalo Gulch sanitary
5 landfill by 2028. The department of environmental services of
6 the city and county of Honolulu proposed six potential sites
7 upon which to relocate the landfill, and all sites were rejected
8 by the landfill advisory committee because of concerns that
9 locating a landfill above freshwater aquifers may damage the
10 State's water sources. Section 183C-4 (b), Hawaii Revised
11 Statutes, prohibits waste or disposal facilities in a
12 conservation district, except in emergency circumstances where
13 it may be necessary to mitigate significant risks to public
14 health and safety. Furthermore, section 342H-52 (b), Hawaii
15 Revised Statutes, prohibits the construction, modification, or
16 expansion of a waste or disposal facility within a one-half mile
17 buffer zone between the edge of the waste or waste activity and
18 the nearest residential, school, or hospital property line.
19 The purpose of this Act is to:
20 (1) Prohibit landfill units on land in an agricultural
21 district having soil classified by the land study

4 (2) Beginning July 1, 2025, narrow the existing
5 prohibition on the construction, modification, or
6 expansion of waste or disposal facilities within a
7 one-half mile buffer zone of residential, school, or
8 hospital property lines to apply specifically to
9 landfill units or components of landfill units; and
10 (3) Beginning July 1, 2025, prohibit the construction,
11 modification, or expansion of a landfill unit, or any
12 component of a landfill unit, inland of an underground
13 injection control line in a county with a population
14 greater than five hundred thousand, with certain
15 exemptions.
16 SECTION 2. Section 205-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
17 amended by amending subsection (d) to read as follows:
18 "(d) Agricultural districts shall include:
19 (1) Activities or uses as characterized by the cultivation
20 of crops, crops for bioenergy, orchards, forage, and

1 section and to the condition that the uses shall be primarily in
2 pursuit of an agricultural activity.
3 Any deed, lease, agreement of sale, mortgage, or other
4 instrument of conveyance covering any land within the
5 agricultural subdivision shall expressly contain the restriction
6 on uses and the condition, as prescribed in this section^ that
7 these restrictions and conditions shall be encumbrances running
8 with the land until [such time that] the land is reclassified to
9 a land use district other than an agricultural district.
10 If the foregoing requirement of encumbrances running with
11 the land jeopardizes the owner or lessee in obtaining mortgage
12 financing from any of the mortgage lending agencies set forth in
13 the following paragraph, and the requirement is the sole reason
14 for failure to obtain mortgage financing, then the requirement
15 of encumbrances shall, insofar as [sueh] the mortgage financing
16 is jeopardized, be conditionally waived by the appropriate
17 county enforcement officer; provided that the conditional waiver
18 shall become effective only in the event that the property is
19 subjected to foreclosure proceedings by the mortgage lender.

A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO WASTE OR DISPOSAL FACILITIES.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the search for a new
2 landfill for the city and county of Honolulu cannot be
3 prioritized over the protection of Oahu's freshwater aquifers.
4 In 2021, approximately twenty thousand gallons of jet fuel
5 leaked from the Red Hill bulk fuel storage facility and
6 contaminated the Pearl Harbor-Hickam water system that serves
7 ninety-three thousand military and civilian customers. The leak
8 also affected the Honolulu board of water supply, and the city
9 and county has shut down three wells that supply fourteen
10 million gallons of water a day to urban Honolulu. The Honolulu
11 board of water supply is in search of new wells that can supply
12 urban Honolulu, which may not be ready until 2025. To protect
13 and preserve freshwater, a new landfill cannot be built inland
14 of underground injection control lines.
15 The legislature further finds that prime agricultural land
16 should be protected, preserved, and reserved for agricultural

3 The legislature also finds that the city and county of

6 the city and county of Honolulu proposed six potential sites
7 upon which to relocate the landfill, and all sites were rejected
8 by the landfill advisory committee because of concerns that
9 locating a landfill above freshwater aquifers may damage the
10 State's water sources. Section 183C-4 (b), Hawaii Revised
11 Statutes, prohibits waste or disposal facilities in a
12 conservation district, except in emergency circumstances where
13 it may be necessary to mitigate significant risks to public
14 health and safety. Furthermore, section 342H-52 (b), Hawaii
15 Revised Statutes, prohibits the construction, modification, or
16 expansion of a waste or disposal facility within a one-half mile
17 buffer zone between the edge of the waste or waste activity and
18 the nearest residential, school, or hospital property line.
19 The purpose of this Act is to:
20 (1) Prohibit landfill units on land in an agricultural
21 district having soil classified by the land study

11 modification, or expansion of a landfill unit, or any
12 component of a landfill unit, inland of an underground
13 injection control line in a county with a population
14 greater than five hundred thousand, with certain
15 exemptions.
16 SECTION 2. Section 205-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
17 amended by amending subsection (d) to read as follows:

5 SECTION 3. Section 205-4.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
6 amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows:
7 " (b) Uses not expressly permitted in subsection (a)^.

3 Any deed, lease, agreement of sale, mortgage, or other
4 instrument of conveyance covering any land within the
5 agricultural subdivision shall expressly contain the restriction
6 on uses and the condition, as prescribed in this section^ that
7 these restrictions and conditions shall be encumbrances running
8 with the land until [such time that] the land is reclassified to
9 a land use district other than an agricultural district.
10 If the foregoing requirement of encumbrances running with
11 the land jeopardizes the owner or lessee in obtaining mortgage
12 financing from any of the mortgage lending agencies set forth in
13 the following paragraph, and the requirement is the sole reason
14 for failure to obtain mortgage financing, then the requirement
15 of encumbrances shall, insofar as [sueh] the mortgage financing
16 is jeopardized, be conditionally waived by the appropriate
17 county enforcement officer; provided that the conditional waiver
18 shall become effective only in the event that the property is
19 subjected to foreclosure proceedings by the mortgage lender.
