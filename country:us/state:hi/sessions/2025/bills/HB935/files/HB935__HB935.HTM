Section 1:
HB935 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 935 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to digital equity. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that digital equity in every community across the State is essential to the well-being and economic reality of the State's residents.  The lack of digital equity is a pressing community issue in Hawaii, and isolates those in rural and socio-economically disadvantaged communities.  This inequality creates a digital divide, which is especially exacerbated amongst the State's most vulnerable and underserved populations. The legislature also finds that digital equity has meant the difference between an employee being able to work remotely and an employee possibly facing unemployment.  Additionally, digital literacy and broadband access are critical tools for persons seeking to access social services, such as unemployment claims; supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits; vital records; and other essential government, educational, and medical services. The legislature further finds that digital equity in the State will enhance Hawaii's overall economic development and education, health care, and emergency services. The purpose of this Act is to establish and appropriate funds for a digital navigator pilot program to offer technical assistance with computers and electronic devices to residents. SECTION 2.  (a) The Hawaii broadband and digital equity office shall establish a two-year navigator pilot program that offers technical assistance with computers and electronic devices for members of the public.
