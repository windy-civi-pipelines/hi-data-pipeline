BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that unauthorized occupancy and trespassing on private and public properties create significant challenges for property owners, residents, and local communities.  The legislature further finds that existing remedies available to property owners regarding unauthorized persons illegally entering or remaining on residential real property is insufficient and do not protect the rights of the property owner.

If appropriate, the law enforcement officer may arrest any person found in the dwelling for trespass, outstanding warrants, or any other legal cause. (d) The law enforcement officer shall be entitled to the same fee for service of the notice to immediately vacate as if the law enforcement officer were serving a writ of possession under section 666-11.  After the law enforcement officer serves the notice to immediately vacate, the property owner or authorized agent of the property owner may request that the law enforcement officer stand by to keep the peace while the property owner or authorized agent of the property owner changes the locks and removes the personal property of the unlawful occupants from the premises to or near the property line. When such a request is made, the law enforcement officer may charge a reasonable hourly rate, and the person requesting the law enforcement officer to stand by and keep the peace shall be responsible for paying the reasonable hourly rate set by the law enforcement agency of the law enforcement officer.  The law enforcement officer shall not be liable to the unlawful occupant or any other party for loss, destruction, or damage of property.  The property owner or the authorized agent of the owner shall not be liable to an unlawful occupant or any other party for the loss, destruction, or damage to the personal property unless the removal was wrongful. §   -3  Civil cause of action for wrongful removal.  (a)  A person may bring a civil cause of action for wrongful removal under this chapter.

(c) The court shall give priority to a cause of action for wrongful removal."
