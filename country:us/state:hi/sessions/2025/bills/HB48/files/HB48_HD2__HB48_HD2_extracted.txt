Section 1:
HB48 HD2 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 48 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO COFFEE LABELING. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that, despite recent amendments to existing laws on coffee labeling and advertising, further amendments are necessary to avoid confusion regarding foreign-grown coffee that is processed in the State. Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to support Hawaii's coffee growers by clarifying the existing laws on the labeling and advertising of certain coffee products and making necessary distinctions between the definitions of "geographic origin" and "regional origin". SECTION 2.  Section 486-120.6, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended as follows: 1. By amending its title and subsections (a) and (b) to read: "§486-120.6  Hawaii-grown and [Hawaii-processed] -processed coffee; labeling or advertising requirements.

(b)  A listing of the geographic origins of the various Hawaii-grown and [Hawaii-processed] -processed coffees and the regional origins of the various coffees not grown [or] and processed in Hawaii that are included in a blend under subsection (a)(2) shall be shown on the label.  This list shall consist of the term "Contains:", followed by, in descending order of per cent coffee by weight and separated by commas, the respective geographic origin or regional origin of the various coffees in the blend.  Each geographic origin or regional origin shall be preceded by the per cent coffee by weight represented by that geographic origin or regional origin, expressed as a number followed by the per cent sign.  In place of separate listings of regional origins of coffee not grown [or] and processed in Hawaii in the blend, the list may include the words "Foreign-grown Coffee", preceded by the per cent coffee by weight in the blend.  The type size used for this list shall be no less than half that of the identity statement.

"Per cent coffee by weight" means the percentage calculated by dividing the weight in pounds of roasted green coffee beans of one geographic or regional origin used in a production run of roasted coffee, instant coffee, or ready-to-drink coffee beverages by the total weight in pounds of the roasted green coffee beans used in that production run of roasted coffee, instant coffee, or ready-to-drink coffee beverages, and multiplying the quotient by one hundred.
