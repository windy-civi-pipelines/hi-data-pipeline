Section 1:
SB665 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 665 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to energy. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the settlement agreement to Navahine F. v. Hawaii Department of Transportation, Civ. No. 1CCV-22-0000631 (Environmental Court), requires the department of transportation, in consultation with other state and local agencies, to develop and implement a greenhouse gas reduction plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the statewide transportation system on a timeline that complies with existing law and to establish interim greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets to achieve the goals established in Hawaii's zero emissions clean economy target law no later than 2045.  The settlement agreement also notes the department of transportation's duty to take any actions necessary to achieve the State's zero emissions transportation goals, specifically to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions across all transportation modes within the State, including across all sectors of ground transportation and sea and air interisland transportation. The legislature further finds that any combustion of carbon-based fuels releases greenhouse gas emissions and cannot be a legitimate part of the greenhouse gas reduction plan.  Electrifying transportation can only be considered zero emission once the electric generation sector is combustion-free. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to require the Hawaii state energy office to commission a study to identify the most cost-effective investments for clean energy alternatives to combustible fuels. SECTION 2. (a)  The Hawaii state energy office shall commission a study of different energy consumption sectors, such as electricity, transportation, and heating, to determine which sector can be most quickly and cost-effectively decarbonized through additional public investment in combustion-free renewable energy sources.  The study shall evaluate residential, commercial, and industrial sectors for electricity and heating consumption, as well as ground transportation, sea and air interisland transportation, and international cargo shipping.  The study shall also include and prioritize conservation and efficiency strategies, as well as storage strategies to ensure firm energy. (b) The Hawaii state energy office shall submit a report of its findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 2026. SECTION 3. This Act shall take effect upon its approval. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: HSEO; Energy; Combustible Fuel Alternatives; Study; Report Description: Requires the Hawaii State Energy Office to conduct a study to identify the most cost-effective investments for clean energy alternatives to combustible fuels.  Requires a report to the Legislature.
