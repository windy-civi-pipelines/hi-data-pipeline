SB625 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 625 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO HAWAIIAN HOME LANDS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature recognizes the importance of effective governance and qualified members to guide the Hawaiian homes commission.  In 1921, the United States Congress enacted the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act to provide homesteading for native Hawaiians, reserving for this purpose approximately 200,000 acres of "available land".  The legislature, however, acknowledges the challenges faced by the Hawaiian homes commission since its inception. The department of Hawaiian home lands has distributed lots to ten thousand beneficiaries, but over twenty-nine thousand people remain on the waitlist, and more than two thousand have died while on the waitlist.  Following the 2023 Maui wildfires in Lahaina, advocates for beneficiaries have urged lawmakers to amend the organization of the Hawaiian homes commission and the qualifications and selection process for members of the commission. The purpose of this Act is to amend the qualifications of commission members, require commission members to be elected, place term limits on commission members, and establish the office of director of the commission, to be filled by election. SECTION 2. Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, as amended, is amended by adding five new sections to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§A.  Qualifications of commission members.  (a) No person shall be eligible for election to the commission unless the person: (1)  Is a beneficiary under this Act; (2)  Will be a resident of the State for at least three years by the date of the person's election to the commission; (3)  Has attained the age of eighteen years or will have attained that age within one year of the date of the next election of commission members; and (4)  Is otherwise qualified to register to vote in the State. (b)  No member of the commission shall hold or be a candidate for any other public office under the state or county governments in accordance with article II, section 7, of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii; nor shall a person be eligible for election to the commission if that person is also a candidate for any other public office under the state or county governments.  For the purposes of this subsection, the term "public office" shall not include notaries public, reserve police officers, or officers of emergency organizations for civilian defense or disaster, or disaster relief. §B.  Qualifications of the director of Hawaiian home lands.  (a)  No person shall be eligible for election to the office of director of Hawaiian home lands unless the person: (1)  Meets all qualifications for the office as established by state law; (2)  Will be a resident of the State for at least three years by the date of the person's election to the commission; and (3)  Is otherwise qualified to register to vote in the State.

(e)  The cost of the election of commission members and director of Hawaiian home lands shall be borne by the department of Hawaiian home lands using the Hawaiian home lands trust fund. §D.  Qualification of voters; registration.  No person shall be eligible to register as a voter for the election of commission members or the director of Hawaiian home lands unless the person is qualified to register to vote in the State under applicable law. §E.  Commissioners; directors; terms of office; vacancies.  (a)  The term of office of members of the commission and director of Hawaiian home lands shall be two years, beginning on the day of the special election held in conjunction with the general election of the year in which they are elected and ending on the day of the special election held in conjunction with the following general election.
