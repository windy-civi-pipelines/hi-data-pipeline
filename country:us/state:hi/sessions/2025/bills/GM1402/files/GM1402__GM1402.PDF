STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS TO HOUSE BILL NO. 1296
Honorable Members
Thirty-Third Legislature
State of Hawaii
Pursuant to Section 16 of Article III of the Constitution of the State of
Hawaii, I am returning herewith, without my approval. House Bill No. 1296, entitled "A
Bill for an Act Relating to the Major Disaster Fund."
The purposes of this bill are (1) to add to the existing requirement that the
Administrator of Emergency Management (Administrator) file a report following an
allotment from the Major Disaster Fund (Fund) by also requiring a report following a
"transfer" from the Fund; (2) to shorten from sixty days to thirty days the time that the
Administrator has to file a report following an allotment or transfer; (3) to add a
requirement that the report must include a description of the allotment and use of funds;
(4) to require that the report include an accounting of Federal Emergency Management
Agency eligible and ineligible expenses; and (5) to require the Governor and the
Administrator to submit a report no later than October 1,2025, for the prior fiscal year.
This bill is objectionable because it will interfere with the ability of the
Administration to quickly deploy resources in the Fund in response to emergencies.
During emergencies, it is critical that the Administration have flexibility to address
rapidly changing situations. The Administration is committed to using state funds in a
transparent and efficient manner. However, the new administrative burdens this bill
places on utilizing the Fund may jeopardize public safety.
For the foregoing reasons, I am returning House Bill No. 1296 without my
approval.
Respectfully,
JOSH GREEN, M.D.
Governor of Hawaii

STATE OF HAWAII S.D. 1
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO THE MAJOR DISASTER FUND.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the devastating
2 wildfires brought on by winds from hurricane Dora on August 8,
3 2023, resulted in one of the worst natural disasters in the
4 State's history. The wildfires caused loss of life and the
5 displacement of thousands on the island of Maui. The disaster
6 also destroyed nearly all of Lahaina.
7 The legislature further finds that to support response and
8 recovery efforts and address immediate 2023 Maui wildfire
9 funding needs, the governor, through several emergency
10 proclamations relating to wildfires and other executive powers,
11 has redirected appropriations from selected general fund
12 operating appropriations originally intended for specific
13 purposes and capital improvement projects, to the department of
14 budget and finance. The department of budget and finance
15 subsequently transferred funds to the major disaster fund. With
16 the veto of S.B. No. 3068, C.D. 2 (2024), and in light of the
17 provisions of S.B. No. 582, C.D. 1 (2024), provisions regarding
2025-3418 HB1296 CDl HMSO
iMiiiiiiiiiimwiii

H.B. NO.
C.D. 1
1 transparency and accountability for the use of appropriations
2 redirected no longer exist in statute.
3 The legislature believes that full transparency and
4 accountability requires a full accounting of all appropriations
5 transferred and deposited into the major disaster fund, and all
6 reimbursements of Federal Emergency Management Agency funds
7 received by the major disaster fund. In addition, assessing the
8 impacts to departments of the transfers made from various
9 appropriations is vital to ensuring that programs from which
10 funding was transferred remain effective.
11 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish timely
12 notice and reporting requirements to the legislature regarding
13 the transfer of appropriations to the major disaster fund.
14 SECTION 2. Section 127A-16, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
15 amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows:
16 " (b) No later than [-sixty] thirty days after any allotment
17 or transfer by the governor or the expenditure of any fund
18 moneys, the administrator shall report to the legislature on the
19 purpose of the allotment, transfer, or expenditure. The report
20 shall:

6 (B) The amount of allotment, transfer, or
7 expenditure;
8 (C) The program identification number from which
9 funds were transferred or expended;
10 (D) The program identification number to which funds
11 were transferred;
12 (E) The impact on the program identification number
13 from which funds are transferred or expended; and
14 (F) A detailed explanation of:
15 (i) The uses of the resources transferred or
16 expended; and
17 (ii) The public purposes served by the transfer
18 of the resources."
19 SECTION 3. No later than October 1, 2025, the governor and
20 administrator of the Hawaii emergency management agency shall
21 submit to the legislature a summary report containing the
2025-3418 HB1296 CDl HMSO
