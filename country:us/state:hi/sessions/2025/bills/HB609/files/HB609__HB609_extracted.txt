HB609 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 609 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to sex trafficking. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that sex trafficking is a pervasive problem that is part of the larger phenomenon of commercial sexual exploitation.  A 2020 report by the Office of Sex Trafficking Intervention Research of Arizona State University and the Hawaii state commission on the status of women noted that sex trafficking victims have been found throughout Hawaii's urban and rural areas and include youth who attend school.  The report also observed that the "lack of a general understanding of the scope and complexity of sex trafficking in Hawaii has allowed the victimization of Hawaii residents to continue". Similarly, the National Human Trafficking Resource Center observed that the widespread lack of awareness and understanding of human trafficking has resulted in low levels of survivor identification by the people who most often encounter them.  Because trafficking occurs in legitimate business settings and residential neighborhoods in addition to underground markets, exploited or trafficked persons are often in plain view and interacting with unsuspecting community members. The legislature also finds that the adverse impacts of sex trafficking are far-reaching and affect individuals, families, and communities.  Further, traffickers may target school-aged children by having classmates or peers befriend the victim and lure the victim to parties and other activities. Traffickers also use social media platforms and websites to attract potential victims.  However, victims are often reluctant to report their traffickers, who commonly employ tactics such as emotional manipulation and control, intimidation, threats, and deceit.  In some cases, the trafficker may be a family member or romantic partner of the victim. For these reasons, the legislature recognizes the urgent need for educational and outreach activities that will help to identify and prevent sex trafficking before it occurs. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to require: (1)  The posting of informational placards containing information on sex trafficking and resources available to sex trafficking victims in public buildings and at other specified locations; (2)  The department of education to provide training to teachers, school administrators, and other school personnel on the dynamics of sex trafficking and strategies for prevention and response; and (3)  The department of the attorney general to develop and implement a series of public education and outreach events on the dynamics of sex trafficking and the importance of community involvement in sex trafficking prevention and response efforts, and to appropriate moneys to the department for this purpose. SECTION 2.  Chapter 27, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part I to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§27-     Sex trafficking prevention; posting of notice required.  (a) Each of the locations specified below, upon the availability of the model placard described in subsection (c), shall have posted in a conspicuous place near the public entrance or in another conspicuous location in clear view of the public and employees, and in a place where similar notices are customarily posted, an informational placard that complies with the requirements of this section: (1)  All offices of state agencies under the executive, judicial, and legislative branches; (2)  All offices of county agencies; (3)  All school campuses under the jurisdiction of the department of education; and (4)  All offices and classrooms at each school campus in the university of Hawaii system. (b)  The informational placard required to be posted pursuant to subsection (a) shall be at least eight and one-half inches by eleven inches in size, written in a sixteen-point font or larger, and shall include: (1)  An explanation of sex trafficking and typical forms of sex trafficking; (2)  A statement that victims of sex trafficking are protected under federal and state law; (3)  Information on resources and support, including the National Human Trafficking Hotline; and (4)  Detailed information on the National Human Trafficking Hotline, including specific statements that the hotline: (A)  May be reached by calling a telephone number, to be printed on the placard, or by sending a text message to a number, to be printed on the placard, to access help and services; (B)  Is available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, every day of the year; (C)  Can provide help, referral to services, training, and general information in more than two hundred languages; (D)  Is operated by a nonprofit, non-governmental organization; and (E)  Will ensure that all communications with the hotline are anonymous and confidential.

SECTION 3.  Chapter 302A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part III to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§302A-     Sex trafficking prevention and response training.  (a) The department shall provide training for teachers, educational officers, and school-based behavioral health specialists on the dynamics of sex trafficking and strategies for prevention and response, including: (1)  Methods used by sex traffickers to lure children into sex trafficking; (2)  Ways to identify victims of sex trafficking; (3)  Effects of sex trafficking on victims' social, mental, and physical health; (4)  Impacts of sex trafficking on children of different racial and ethic backgrounds, sexual orientations, and gender identities; (5)  Strategies to assist in the prevention of child sex trafficking; (6)  Trauma-informed strategies for responding to victims of sex trafficking; (7)  Informational resources for victims of sex trafficking; (8)  Information on victim service providers that provide services to students who have been identified as victims of sex trafficking or who are at risk of victimization; and (9)  Information on the importance of obtaining enthusiastic consent, in the context of dating and intimate relationships, with respect to preventing sex trafficking and other forms of sexual violence.
