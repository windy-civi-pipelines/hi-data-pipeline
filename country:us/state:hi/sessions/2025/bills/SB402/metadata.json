      "abstract": "Establishes notice requirements for employers under Hawaii's Workers' Compensation Law.  Requires employers who deny the compensability of an employee's injury to submit a written report supporting the denial to the Director of Labor and Industrial Relations within a specified period.  Requires employers to furnish to the injured employee up to $10,000 for medical care, services, and supplies for the period immediately following the injury and so long as reasonably needed or until the employer files a written report with the Director denying the compensability of the injury, whichever is earlier.  Clarifies that failure to give an employer notice of an employee's injury does not bar a claim for compensation if any person having authority in the interest of the employer had knowledge of the injury."
