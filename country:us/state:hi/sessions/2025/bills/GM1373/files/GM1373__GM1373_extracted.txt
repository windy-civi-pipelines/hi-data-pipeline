C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO LAULAU DAY.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII;
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that one of the most
2 popular traditional dishes to eat in the State is laulau.
3 Laulau is made from pork or fish wrapped in kalo and ti leaves
4 and then steamed, traditionally in an underground oven known as
5 an imu. The preparation and consumption of laulau are cherished
6 practices in Hawaiian communities, often shared at family
7 gatherings, celebrations, and feasts, serving as a symbol of
8 unity and cultural pride.
9 The legislature further finds that the preservation and
10 promotion of Hawaiian food traditions are essential to honoring
11 the rich legacy of Native Hawaiian culture and fostering a
12 deeper understanding of the cultural practices that have been
13 passed down through generations. The designation of "Laulau
14 Day" will provide an opportunity to celebrate and recognize this
15 iconic dish, raise awareness of its cultural significance, and
16 support local farmers, chefs, and communities who continue to
17 keep these traditions alive.
