A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO STATE BONDS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. Declaration of findings with respect to the
2 general obligation bonds authorized by this Act. Pursuant to
3 article VII, section 13, of the state constitution, which
4 states: "Effective July 1, 1980, the legislature shall include
5 a declaration of findings in every general law authorizing the
6 issuance of general obligation bonds that the total amount of
7 principal and interest, estimated for such bonds and for all
8 bonds authorized and unissued and calculated for all bonds
9 issued and outstanding, will not cause the debt limit to be
10 exceeded at the time of issuance", the legislature finds and
11 declares as follows:
12 (1) Limitation on general obligation debt. The debt limit
13 of the State is set forth in article VII, section 13,
14 of the state constitution, which states in part:
15 "General obligation bonds may be issued by the State;
16 provided that such bonds at the time of issuance would
17 not cause the total amount of principal and interest

1 payable in the current or any future fiscal year,
2 whichever is higher, on such bonds and on all
3 outstanding general obligation bonds to exceed: a sum
4 equal to twenty percent of the average of the general
5 fund revenues of the State in the three fiscal years
6 immediately preceding such issuance until June 30,
7 1982; and thereafter, a sum equal to eighteen and one-
8 half percent of the average of the general fund
9 revenues of the State in the three fiscal years
10 immediately preceding such issuance." Article VII,
11 section 13, of the state constitution also provides
12 that in determining the power of the State to issue
13 general obligation bonds, certain bonds are
14 excludable, including "[r]eimbursable general
15 obligation bonds issued for a public undertaking,
16 improvement or system but only to the extent that
17 reimbursements to the general fund are in fact made
18 from the net revenue, or net user tax receipts, or
19 combination of both, as determined for the immediately
20 preceding fiscal year" and bonds constituting
21 instruments of indebtedness under which the State

1 incurs a contingent liability as a guarantor, but only
2 to the extent the principal amount of those bonds does
3 not exceed seven per cent of the principal amount of
4 outstanding general obligation bonds not otherwise
5 excluded under article VII, section 13, of the state
6 constitution.
7 (2) Actual and estimated debt limits. The limit on
8 principal and interest of general obligation bonds
9 issued by the State, actual for fiscal year 2024-2025

11 2028-2029, is as follows:

13 on estimates made by the department of budget and
14 finance of those receipts that cannot be included as
15 general fund revenues for the purpose of calculating

2 general obligation bonds is $4,256,835,085. The
3 total amount of general obligation bonds
4 authorized in this Act is $1,913,987,000. The
5 total amount of general obligation bonds
6 previously authorized and unissued, as adjusted,
7 and the general obligation bonds authorized in
8 this Act is $6,134,440,085.
9 (B) As reported by the department of budget and
10 finance, the outstanding principal amount of
11 bonds constituting instruments of indebtedness
12 under which the State may incur a contingent
13 liability as a guarantor is $233,500,000, all or
14 part of which is excludable in determining the
15 power of the State to issue general obligation
16 bonds, pursuant to article VII, section 13, of
17 the Hawaii State Constitution.
18 (5) Proposed general obligation bond issuance. As
19 reported therein for the fiscal years 2024-2025, 2025-
20 2026, 2026-2027, 2027-2028, and 2028-2029, the State
21 proposes to issue $800,000,000 in general obligation

C.D. 1
1 bonds during the second half of fiscal year 2024-2025,
2 $775,000,000 in general obligation bonds semi-annually
3 during fiscal year 2025-2026, $700,000,000 in general
4 obligation bonds semi-annually during fiscal year
5 2026-2027, $650,000,000 in general obligation bonds
6 semi-annually during fiscal year 2027-2028, and
7 $550,000,000 in general obligation bonds semi-annually
8 during fiscal year 2028-2029. The State anticipates
9 issuing a combination of twenty-year serial bonds with
10 principal repayments beginning the first year and
11 seven-year serial bonds with principal repayments
12 beginning the first year, payable in substantially
13 equal annual installments of principal and interest
14 payment with interest payments commencing six months
15 from the date of issuance and being paid semi-annually
16 thereafter. It is assumed that this practice will
17 continue to be applied to the bonds that are proposed
18 to be issued.
19 (6) Sufficiency of proposed general obligation bond
20 issuance to meet the requirements of authorized and
21 unissued bonds, as adjusted, and bonds authorized by
2025-3447 HB794 GDI HMSO 9

C.D. 1
1 this Act. From the schedule reported in paragraph
2 (5), the total amount of general obligation bonds that
3 the State proposes to issue during the fiscal years
4 2024-2025 to 2027-2028 is $5,050,000,000. An
5 additional $1,100,000,000 is proposed to be issued in
6 fiscal year 2028-2029. The total amount of
7 $5,050,000,000 that is proposed to be issued through
8 fiscal year 2027-2028 is sufficient to meet the
9 requirements of the authorized and unissued bonds, as
10 adjusted, the total amount of which is $6,134,440,085
11 reported in paragraph (4), except for $1,084,440,085.
12 It is assumed that the appropriations to which an
13 additional $1,084,440,085 in bond issuance needs to be
14 applied will have been encumbered as of June 30, 2028.
15 The $1,100,000,000 that is proposed to be issued in
16 fiscal year 2028-2029 will be sufficient to meet the
17 requirements of the June 30, 2028 encumbrances in the
18 amount of $1,084,440,085. The amount of assumed
19 encumbrances as of June 30, 2028, is reasonable and
20 conservative, based upon an inspection of June 30
21 encumbrances of the general obligation bond fund as
2025-3447 HB794 GDI HMSO 10

C.D. 1
1 reported by the state comptroller. Thus, taking into
2 account the amount of authorized and unissued bonds,
3 as adjusted, and the bonds authorized by this Act
4 versus the amount of bonds proposed to be issued by
5 June 30, 2028, and the amount of June 30, 2028
6 encumbrances versus the amount of bonds proposed to be
7 issued in fiscal year 2028-2029, the legislature finds
8 that in the aggregate, the amount of bonds proposed to
9 be issued is sufficient to meet the requirements of
10 all authorized and unissued bonds and the bonds
11 authorized by this Act.
12 (7) Bonds excludable in determining the power of the State
13 to issue bonds. As noted in paragraph (1), certain
14 bonds are excludable in determining the power of the
15 State to issue general obligation bonds.
16 (A) General obligation reimbursable bonds can be
17 excluded under certain conditions. It is not
18 possible to make a conclusive determination as to
19 the amount of reimbursable bonds which are
20 excludable from the amount of each proposed bond
21 issued because:
2025-3447 HB794 GDI HMSO 11
Page 12 H.B. NO.
hJj
C.D. 1
1 (i) It is not known exactly when projects for
2 which reimbursable bonds have been
3 authorized in prior acts and in this Act
4 will be implemented and will require the
5 application of proceeds from a particular
6 bond issue; and
7 (ii) Not all reimbursable general obligation
8 bonds may qualify for exclusion.
9 However, the legislature notes that with respect
10 to the principal and interest on outstanding
11 general obligation bonds, according to the
12 department of budget and finance, the average
13 proportion of principal and interest that is
14 excludable each year from the calculation against
15 the debt limit is 0.37 per cent for approximately
16 ten years from fiscal year 2025-2026 to fiscal
17 year 2034-2035. For the purpose of this
18 declaration, the assumption is made that 0.25 per
19 cent of each bond issue will be excludable from
20 the debt limit, an assumption that the
2025-3447 HB794 CDl HMSO 12

kdi
C.D. 1
1 legislature finds to be reasonable and
2 conservative.
3 (B) Bonds constituting instruments of indebtedness
4 under which the State incurs a contingent
5 liability as a guarantor can be excluded, but
6 only to the extent the principal amount of those
7 guaranties does not exceed seven per cent of the
8 principal amount of outstanding general
9 obligation bonds not otherwise excluded under
10 subparagraph (A) of this paragraph (7); and
11 provided that the State shall establish and
12 maintain a reserve in an amount in reasonable
13 proportion to the outstanding loans guaranteed by
14 the State as provided by law. According to the
15 department of budget and finance and the
16 assumptions presented herein, the total principal
17 amount of outstanding general obligation bonds
18 and general obligation bonds proposed to be
19 issued, which are not otherwise excluded under
20 article VII, section 13, of the Hawaii State
21 Constitution for the fiscal years 2024-2025,

C.D. 1
1 2025-2026, 2026-2027, 2027-2028, and 2028-2029
2 are as follows:
3 Total amount of
4 General Obligation Bonds
5 not otherwise excluded by
6 Article VII, Section 13
7 Fiscal year of the State Constitution
8 2024-2025 $9,499,257,832
9 2025-2026 11,045,387,832
10 2026-2027 12,441,887,832
11 2027-2028 13,738,637,832
12 2028-2029 14,835,887,832
13 Based on the foregoing and based on the assumption
14 that the full amount of a guaranty is immediately due
15 and payable when the guaranty changes from a
16 contingent liability to an actual liability, the
17 aggregate principal amount of the portion of the
18 outstanding guaranties and the guaranties proposed to
19 be incurred, which does not exceed seven per cent of
20 the average amount set forth in the last column of the
21 above table and for which reserve funds have been or
22 will have been established as heretofore provided, can
23 be excluded in determining the power of the State to
24 issue general obligation bonds. As it is not possible
25 to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty when
2025-3447 HB794 CDl HMSO 14
IIIIIIIHIOilMlllllllliil
Page 15
H.B. NO.
C.D. 1
1 a guaranty will change from a contingent liability to
2 an actual liability, it is assumed in conformity with
3 fiscal conservatism and prudence, that all guaranties
4 not otherwise excluded pursuant to article VII,
5 section 13, of the Hawaii State Constitution will
6 become due and payable in the same fiscal year in
7 which the greatest amount of principal and interest on
8 general obligation bonds, after exclusions, occurs.
9 Thus, based on these assumptions and on the
10 determination in paragraph (8), all of the outstanding
11 guaranties can be excluded.
12 (8) Determination whether the debt limit will be exceeded
13 at the time of issuance. From the foregoing and on
14 the assumption that all of the bonds identified in
15 paragraph (5) will be issued at an interest rate not
16 to exceed 7.50 per cent in fiscal years 2025 through
17 2029, it can be determined from the following schedule
18 that the bonds that are proposed to be issued, which
19 include all authorized and unissued bonds previously
20 authorized, as adjusted, general obligation bonds, and
21 instruments of indebtedness under which the State

30 (9) Overall and concluding finding. From the facts
31 estimates, and assumptions stated in this declaration

34 general obligation bonds authorized in this Act, and

1 for all bonds authorized and unissued, and calculated
2 for all bonds issued and outstanding, and all
3 guaranties, will not cause the debt limit to be
4 exceeded at the time of issuance.
5 SECTION 2. The legislature finds the bases for the
6 declaration of findings set forth in this Act are reasonable.
7 The assumptions set forth in this Act with respect to the
8 principal amount of general obligation bonds that will be
9 issued, the amount of principal and interest on reimbursable
10 general obligation bonds that are assumed to be excludable, and
11 the assumed maturity structure shall not be deemed to be
12 binding, it being the understanding of the legislature that
13 these matters shall remain subject to substantial flexibility.
14 SECTION 3. Authorization for issuance of general
15 obligation bonds. General obligation bonds may be issued as
16 provided by law in an amount that may be necessary to finance
17 projects authorized in House Bill No. 300, H.D. 1, S.D. 1, C.D.

A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO STATE BONDS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. Declaration of findings with respect to the
2 general obligation bonds authorized by this Act. Pursuant to
3 article VII, section 13, of the state constitution, which
4 states: "Effective July 1, 1980, the legislature shall include
5 a declaration of findings in every general law authorizing the
6 issuance of general obligation bonds that the total amount of
7 principal and interest, estimated for such bonds and for all
8 bonds authorized and unissued and calculated for all bonds
9 issued and outstanding, will not cause the debt limit to be
10 exceeded at the time of issuance", the legislature finds and
11 declares as follows:
12 (1) Limitation on general obligation debt. The debt limit
13 of the State is set forth in article VII, section 13,
14 of the state constitution, which states in part:
15 "General obligation bonds may be issued by the State;
16 provided that such bonds at the time of issuance would
17 not cause the total amount of principal and interest

1 payable in the current or any future fiscal year,
2 whichever is higher, on such bonds and on all
3 outstanding general obligation bonds to exceed: a sum
4 equal to twenty percent of the average of the general
5 fund revenues of the State in the three fiscal years
6 immediately preceding such issuance until June 30,
7 1982; and thereafter, a sum equal to eighteen and one-
8 half percent of the average of the general fund
9 revenues of the State in the three fiscal years
10 immediately preceding such issuance." Article VII,
11 section 13, of the state constitution also provides
12 that in determining the power of the State to issue
13 general obligation bonds, certain bonds are
14 excludable, including "[r]eimbursable general
15 obligation bonds issued for a public undertaking,
16 improvement or system but only to the extent that
17 reimbursements to the general fund are in fact made
18 from the net revenue, or net user tax receipts, or
19 combination of both, as determined for the immediately
20 preceding fiscal year" and bonds constituting
21 instruments of indebtedness under which the State

1 incurs a contingent liability as a guarantor, but only
2 to the extent the principal amount of those bonds does
3 not exceed seven per cent of the principal amount of
4 outstanding general obligation bonds not otherwise
5 excluded under article VII, section 13, of the state
6 constitution.
7 (2) Actual and estimated debt limits. The limit on
8 principal and interest of general obligation bonds

5 total amount of general obligation bonds
6 previously authorized and unissued, as adjusted,
7 and the general obligation bonds authorized in
8 this Act is $6,134,440,085.
9 (B) As reported by the department of budget and

C.D. 1
1 bonds during the second half of fiscal year 2024-2025,
2 $775,000,000 in general obligation bonds semi-annually
3 during fiscal year 2025-2026, $700,000,000 in general
4 obligation bonds semi-annually during fiscal year
5 2026-2027, $650,000,000 in general obligation bonds
6 semi-annually during fiscal year 2027-2028, and
7 $550,000,000 in general obligation bonds semi-annually
8 during fiscal year 2028-2029. The State anticipates
9 issuing a combination of twenty-year serial bonds with
10 principal repayments beginning the first year and
11 seven-year serial bonds with principal repayments
12 beginning the first year, payable in substantially
13 equal annual installments of principal and interest
14 payment with interest payments commencing six months
15 from the date of issuance and being paid semi-annually
16 thereafter. It is assumed that this practice will
17 continue to be applied to the bonds that are proposed
18 to be issued.
19 (6) Sufficiency of proposed general obligation bond
20 issuance to meet the requirements of authorized and
21 unissued bonds, as adjusted, and bonds authorized by
2025-3447 HB794 GDI HMSO 9

C.D. 1
1 this Act. From the schedule reported in paragraph
2 (5), the total amount of general obligation bonds that
3 the State proposes to issue during the fiscal years
4 2024-2025 to 2027-2028 is $5,050,000,000. An
5 additional $1,100,000,000 is proposed to be issued in
6 fiscal year 2028-2029. The total amount of
7 $5,050,000,000 that is proposed to be issued through
8 fiscal year 2027-2028 is sufficient to meet the
9 requirements of the authorized and unissued bonds, as
10 adjusted, the total amount of which is $6,134,440,085
11 reported in paragraph (4), except for $1,084,440,085.
12 It is assumed that the appropriations to which an
13 additional $1,084,440,085 in bond issuance needs to be
14 applied will have been encumbered as of June 30, 2028.
15 The $1,100,000,000 that is proposed to be issued in
16 fiscal year 2028-2029 will be sufficient to meet the
17 requirements of the June 30, 2028 encumbrances in the
18 amount of $1,084,440,085. The amount of assumed
19 encumbrances as of June 30, 2028, is reasonable and
20 conservative, based upon an inspection of June 30
21 encumbrances of the general obligation bond fund as
2025-3447 HB794 GDI HMSO 10

1 reported by the state comptroller. Thus, taking into
2 account the amount of authorized and unissued bonds,
3 as adjusted, and the bonds authorized by this Act
4 versus the amount of bonds proposed to be issued by
5 June 30, 2028, and the amount of June 30, 2028
6 encumbrances versus the amount of bonds proposed to be
7 issued in fiscal year 2028-2029, the legislature finds
8 that in the aggregate, the amount of bonds proposed to
9 be issued is sufficient to meet the requirements of
10 all authorized and unissued bonds and the bonds
11 authorized by this Act.
12 (7) Bonds excludable in determining the power of the State
13 to issue bonds. As noted in paragraph (1), certain
14 bonds are excludable in determining the power of the
15 State to issue general obligation bonds.
16 (A) General obligation reimbursable bonds can be
17 excluded under certain conditions. It is not
18 possible to make a conclusive determination as to
19 the amount of reimbursable bonds which are
20 excludable from the amount of each proposed bond
21 issued because:
2025-3447 HB794 GDI HMSO 11

Page 12 H.B. NO.
hJj
C.D. 1
1 (i) It is not known exactly when projects for
2 which reimbursable bonds have been
3 authorized in prior acts and in this Act
4 will be implemented and will require the
5 application of proceeds from a particular
6 bond issue; and
7 (ii) Not all reimbursable general obligation
8 bonds may qualify for exclusion.
9 However, the legislature notes that with respect
10 to the principal and interest on outstanding
11 general obligation bonds, according to the
12 department of budget and finance, the average
13 proportion of principal and interest that is
14 excludable each year from the calculation against
15 the debt limit is 0.37 per cent for approximately
16 ten years from fiscal year 2025-2026 to fiscal
17 year 2034-2035. For the purpose of this
18 declaration, the assumption is made that 0.25 per
19 cent of each bond issue will be excludable from
20 the debt limit, an assumption that the
2025-3447 HB794 CDl HMSO 12

C.D. 1
1 legislature finds to be reasonable and
2 conservative.
3 (B) Bonds constituting instruments of indebtedness
4 under which the State incurs a contingent
5 liability as a guarantor can be excluded, but
6 only to the extent the principal amount of those
7 guaranties does not exceed seven per cent of the
8 principal amount of outstanding general
9 obligation bonds not otherwise excluded under
10 subparagraph (A) of this paragraph (7); and
11 provided that the State shall establish and
12 maintain a reserve in an amount in reasonable
13 proportion to the outstanding loans guaranteed by
14 the State as provided by law. According to the
15 department of budget and finance and the
16 assumptions presented herein, the total principal
17 amount of outstanding general obligation bonds
18 and general obligation bonds proposed to be
19 issued, which are not otherwise excluded under
20 article VII, section 13, of the Hawaii State
21 Constitution for the fiscal years 2024-2025,

6 Article VII, Section 13
7 Fiscal year of the State Constitution
8 2024-2025 $9,499,257,832
9 2025-2026 11,045,387,832
10 2026-2027 12,441,887,832
11 2027-2028 13,738,637,832
12 2028-2029 14,835,887,832
13 Based on the foregoing and based on the assumption
14 that the full amount of a guaranty is immediately due
15 and payable when the guaranty changes from a
16 contingent liability to an actual liability, the
17 aggregate principal amount of the portion of the
18 outstanding guaranties and the guaranties proposed to
19 be incurred, which does not exceed seven per cent of
20 the average amount set forth in the last column of the
21 above table and for which reserve funds have been or
22 will have been established as heretofore provided, can
23 be excluded in determining the power of the State to
24 issue general obligation bonds. As it is not possible
25 to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty when

1 a guaranty will change from a contingent liability to
2 an actual liability, it is assumed in conformity with
3 fiscal conservatism and prudence, that all guaranties
4 not otherwise excluded pursuant to article VII,
5 section 13, of the Hawaii State Constitution will
6 become due and payable in the same fiscal year in
7 which the greatest amount of principal and interest on
8 general obligation bonds, after exclusions, occurs.
9 Thus, based on these assumptions and on the
10 determination in paragraph (8), all of the outstanding
11 guaranties can be excluded.
12 (8) Determination whether the debt limit will be exceeded
13 at the time of issuance. From the foregoing and on
14 the assumption that all of the bonds identified in
15 paragraph (5) will be issued at an interest rate not
16 to exceed 7.50 per cent in fiscal years 2025 through
17 2029, it can be determined from the following schedule
18 that the bonds that are proposed to be issued, which
19 include all authorized and unissued bonds previously
20 authorized, as adjusted, general obligation bonds, and
21 instruments of indebtedness under which the State

1 for all bonds authorized and unissued, and calculated
2 for all bonds issued and outstanding, and all
3 guaranties, will not cause the debt limit to be
4 exceeded at the time of issuance.
5 SECTION 2. The legislature finds the bases for the
6 declaration of findings set forth in this Act are reasonable.
7 The assumptions set forth in this Act with respect to the
8 principal amount of general obligation bonds that will be
9 issued, the amount of principal and interest on reimbursable
10 general obligation bonds that are assumed to be excludable, and
11 the assumed maturity structure shall not be deemed to be
12 binding, it being the understanding of the legislature that
13 these matters shall remain subject to substantial flexibility.
14 SECTION 3. Authorization for issuance of general
15 obligation bonds. General obligation bonds may be issued as
16 provided by law in an amount that may be necessary to finance
17 projects authorized in House Bill No. 300, H.D. 1, S.D. 1, C.D.
18 1 (the General Appropriations Act of 2025); House Bill No. 400,

5 bond fund with debt service cost to be paid from special funds;
