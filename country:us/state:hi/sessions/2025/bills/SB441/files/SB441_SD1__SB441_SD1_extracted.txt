SB441 SD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 441 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE HAWAII SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the Hawaii Symphony Orchestra provides a significant public service to the State of Hawaii and makes significant musical contributions to the artistic and cultural education of the community through its performances. The legislature further finds that the Hawaii Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1900 to establish and operate a professional symphony orchestra in Hawaii. The symphony hosts shows and programs featuring musicians and performing artists from around the world, in addition to promoting local talent within Hawaii. The legislature recognizes that the State has a certain responsibility to the Hawaii Symphony Orchestra for the public services it provides.  The legislature notes that designating the Hawaii Symphony Orchestra as the "State of Hawaii Symphony Orchestra" will enable the Hawaii Symphony Orchestra to regularly obtain state funds to help cover its general operating costs in exchange for other services to the State, to be mutually negotiated. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to designate the Hawaii Symphony Orchestra as the "State of Hawaii Symphony Orchestra". SECTION 2. Chapter 9, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§9-     Hawaii Symphony Orchestra; designation; funding.  (a)  The Hawaii Symphony Orchestra shall be designated the State of Hawaii Symphony Orchestra. (b)  The qualifying standards and conditions related to the receipt of funds contained in chapter 42F shall not apply to funds received by the State of Hawaii Symphony Orchestra; provided that if the State of Hawaii Symphony Orchestra, in turn, contracts with a recipient or provider, then the qualifying standards, conditions, and other provisions of chapter 42F shall apply to the recipient or provider and the contract. (c)  The designation of the Hawaii Symphony Orchestra as the State of Hawaii Symphony Orchestra shall not impinge on the autonomy of the Hawaii Symphony Orchestra, nor imply state control over its programs or policies, except as specifically provided in this section. (d)  The comptroller and the legislative auditor shall have the authority to examine the use of state funds and shall report any findings to the legislature. (e)  The president and chief executive officer of the Hawaii Symphony Orchestra shall provide an annual report to the legislature no later than twenty days before the legislature convenes each regular session.  At a minimum, the annual report shall include an explanation of the operations, maintenance, and other functions accomplished by state fund expenditures in the previous fiscal year."
