Section 1:
SB746 HD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 746 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO INVASIVE SPECIES. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the coconut rhinoceros beetle, scientifically known as oryctes rhinoceros, is an invasive species that threatens coconut palms and other vegetation.  The beetle bores into the crowns of coconut trees, feeding on the sap and causing severe damage.  However, the beetle's appetite is not limited to coconut palms, and it threatens other tropical plants such as hala, sugarcane, taro, banana, and pineapple. From reduced property values and loss of tourism due to dying palms to increased costs for pest control and tree replacement, the economic consequences are vast and significant. The legislature further finds that the coconut rhinoceros beetle endangers the State's cultural heritage by damaging plants, including hala and taro, that are integral to native Hawaiian practices.  The protection of these plants is essential for preserving local traditions and maintaining a balanced ecosystem.  Wreaking havoc since it was discovered in 2013 at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, the beetle has spread across Oahu and to the islands of Kauai, Maui, and Hawaii. The purpose of this Act is to establish a two-year coconut rhinoceros beetle eradication pilot program under the department of land and natural resources to provide community-based incentives to eradicate the coconut rhinoceros beetle in certain areas of the State. SECTION 2. For the purposes of this Act: "Coconut rhinoceros beetle" means the species scientifically known as oryctes rhinoceros. "Community member" means any resident, military personnel member, farmer, cultural practitioner, golf course staffer, green waste or compost facility worker, retailer, landscape professional, botanical garden staffer, or maintenance worker. SECTION 3. (a)  There is established within the department of land and natural resources a two-year coconut rhinoceros beetle eradication pilot program to incentivize community members to collect and submit to the department the coconut rhinoceros beetle and its larvae; provided that the program shall only be conducted in areas where there are established infestations of coconut rhinoceros beetles within counties with a population of five hundred thousand or more. The Hawaii invasive species council shall oversee the pilot program and ensure the participation of stakeholders, including community members. (b) The department of land and natural resources shall compensate community members for the collection and submission of coconut rhinoceros beetles and larvae that are captured.  The compensation shall be determined by the department in consultation with the Hawaii invasive species council; provided that in no event shall the department compensate any person for collecting or submitting any beetle or larva that was bred by human intervention. SECTION 4. The department of land and natural resources shall submit a report regarding the coconut rhinoceros beetle eradication pilot program, including its findings, recommendations, and any proposed legislation, to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 2026. SECTION 5. There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the costs of operating the coconut rhinoceros beetle eradication pilot program, including: (1)  Compensation to community members; (2)  Program administration; (3)  Community engagement, workshops, and training events; (4)  Digital and social media campaigns; (5)  Media advertising; and (6)  Educational materials and outreach.
