C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF LAND AND NATURAL RESOURCES.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAH:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the people of Hawaii
2 have significant concerns about the effects of over-tourism,
3 including impacts to the environment, and particularly the
4 proliferation of rental kayaks and stand-up paddleboards
5 statewide. The legislature further finds that it is beneficial
6 for the residents and natural resources of the State to regulate
7 commercial rentals where a state park is the location of the
8 watercraft activity. The legislature additionally finds that
9 Wailua river state park on Kauai, Kealakekua bay state
10 historical park on Hawaii island, and Ahupuaa O Kahana state
11 park on Oahu are the only navigable waters within a state park.
12 Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to require:
13 (1) The registration and numbering of rental vessels
14 before they are rented or leased, or offered for rent
15 or lease, to the public for transiting the navigable
16 waters of a state park; and

8 person shall rent or lease, or offer for rent or lease, a vessel

13 authorized by a special use permit.
14 (b) Beginning January 1, 2026, every rental vessel rented
