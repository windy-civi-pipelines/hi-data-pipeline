Section 1:
SB1040 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1040 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to medical debt. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that medical debt has become a widespread issue across the United States.  Approximately four out of every ten Americans, including individuals with health insurance, have some form of medical debt.  According to a 2022 report from the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker, approximately three million Americans have medical debt in amounts exceeding $10,000.  Although Hawaii residents generally have less medical debt than residents in other states, approximately one in ten residents have outstanding medical debt on their credit report.  In other states and cities that have acquired and forgiven unpaid medical debt, most of the forgiven debt was owed by those with health insurance, indicating that many families in the State may also have medical debt, despite having health insurance coverage. The legislature also finds that medical debt is a social determinant of health as patients with burdensome medical debt often delay the care they need, may experience issues obtaining employment and housing, have difficulty escaping poverty, and experience increased mental stress.  The legislature recognizes that due to the significant amount of outstanding debt owed to hospitals and service providers, a secondary market has emerged in which commercial debt buyers purchase outstanding and dormant debt owed to health care providers and take aggressive action to collect from families who find themselves unable to pay, further exacerbating the severity of the medical debt crisis. The legislature further finds that other states and cities in the United States have partnered with a nonprofit organization that has successfully purchased billions of dollars in medical debt from health care providers and collection agencies for about 0.01 per cent of the overall cost and abolished the respective patients' debts altogether.  Health care providers whose owed debt is sold to third parties for abolishment can equally benefit by receiving revenue for dormant patient accounts, while mitigating the effects of social determinant of health and enhancing community well-being. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to require the office of wellness and resilience to develop, implement, and administer a program to acquire and forgive outstanding medical debt. SECTION 2. (a)  The office of wellness and resilience shall develop, implement, and administer a medical debt acquisition and forgiveness program to acquire and forgive outstanding medical debt for households in the State. (b)  The program shall: (1)  Acquire and forgive the medical debt of households with a household income not to exceed four hundred per cent of the federal poverty level for the State, or households with a medical debt balance greater than or equal to five per cent of their household income; and (2)  Ensure that any specific personal identifying information or health data is collected in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability Act and Accountability of 1996, as amended, and is used for no purpose other than the acquisition and forgiveness of medical debt, and provision of financial education, insurance, preventative measures, or similar assistance. (c) The office of wellness and resilience shall contract with an entity with demonstrated experience and success partnering with hospitals and the Hawaii health systems corporation or any of its regional systems in acquiring and forgiving outstanding medical debt on behalf of state and municipal governments. (d)  The office of wellness and resilience may receive appropriations from the legislature, private funds, federal funds for the purpose of acquiring and forgiving outstanding medical debt for the purposes of this Act. (e) The office of wellness and resilience shall submit a report of its findings and recommendations on the medical debt acquisition and forgiveness program, including its progress, to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular session.  The report shall also include an analysis of actions taken by other states in the preceding year which are reasonably related to the cancellation of medical debt, including prohibiting medical debt from appearing on credit reports, and any related recommendations, including any proposed legislation. SECTION 3. There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the development, implementation, and administration of the medical debt acquisition and forgiveness program established pursuant to section 2 of this Act. The sums appropriated shall be expended by the office of wellness and resilience for the purposes of this Act. SECTION 4. This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2026; provided that section 3 shall take effect on July 1, 2025. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: Office of Wellness and Resilience; Medical Debt Acquisition and Forgiveness Program; Reports; Appropriations Description: Requires the Office of Wellness and Resilience to develop, implement, and administer a Medical Debt Acquisition and Forgiveness Program to acquire and forgive medical debt owed by certain households in the State.  Requires annual reports to the Legislature.
