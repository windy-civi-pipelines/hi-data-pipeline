C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO WASTEWATER.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION I. The legislature finds that existing
2 administrative rules allow an individual wastewater system to
3 serve no more than five bedrooms, whether the five bedrooms are
4 in one dwelling unit or two dwelling units. However, the
5 definition of a dwelling unit under chapter 62, Hawaii
6 Administrative Rules, does not clearly consider the varied types
7 of development, such as dwelling units that may have exterior
8 bedrooms without a kitchen or guest houses with a bathroom but
9 without a kitchen. Certain dwelling units may be prohibited
JO from using an individual wastewater system solely because the
11 bedrooms are outside the dwelling unit.
12 Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to allow an
13 individual wastewater system to serve up to five bedrooms,
14 regardless of the number of dwellings, dwelling units, or
15 accessory units, whether the dwellings, dwelling units, or
16 accessory units are attached or detached, with certain
17 exclusions.

9 whether the dwellings, dwelling units, or accessory units are
10 attached or detached; provided that this section shall not apply
11 to any new requests to connect additional dwelling units to an
12 existing cesspool."
13 SECTION 3. New statutory material is underscored.
14 SECTION 4. This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
