STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS TO HOUSE BILL NO. 1369
Honorable Members
Thirty-Third Legislature
State of Hawaii
Pursuant to Section 16 of Article III of the Constitution of the State of
Hawaii, I am returning herewith, without my approval. House Bill No. 1369, entitled "A
Bill for an Act Relating to Taxation."
The purpose of this bill is to amend and repeal certain exemptions under
the general excise tax (GET) and use tax laws. Specifically, the bill: (1) limits the GET
exemption under section 237-24(14), Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS), for amounts
received by sugarcane producers to amounts received on or before December 31,
2030; (2) repeals the use tax exemption under section 238-3(h), HRS, for the value of
certain vessels constructed before July 1, 1969; and (3) repeals the GET exemptions
under section 237-24.5, HRS, related to a stock exchange.
This bill is objectionable because removing these specific tax exemptions
would provide little financial benefit to the State while harming, in particular, sugarcane
producers.
For the foregoing reasons, I am returning House Bill No. 1369 without my
approval.
JOSH GREEN, M.D.
