SB373 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 373 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to online fantasy sports. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the determination that online fantasy sports contests constitute gambling under Hawaii law is not established in statute, administrative rule, or a court opinion, but the opinion of a previous attorney general.  Online fantasy sports contests, unlike gambling activities, are predominantly a game of skill and not of chance.  The notion that online fantasy sports contests are a game of chance has existed since the early days of online fantasy sports contests, but given overwhelming research to the contrary, this theory has been rejected by many states. The legislature further finds that studies have shown that the premise of daily fantasy sports is akin to solitaire and other entertainment recognized as games of skill in the State.  For example, a leading study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2018 looked at the seasonal win and loss record of skilled and unskilled players in a dataset.  When all performances were plotted on the same graph, the graph skewed linear, which indicated a game of skill.  The study subsequently found that if online fantasy sports contests were a game of chance, the graph would present circular with around a fifty per cent win fraction.  In a separate study, the research team split the population into two groups; one group of players who had played a significant number of games, and one group of players who had played only a few.  The group of players who had played more games had a statistically higher win fraction, even after a correction for biases, which the study reported indicated a game of skill.  Furthermore, another rigorous data-driven study undertaken by the researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Columbia University and led by Professor Vishal Mishra, Professor Devavrat Shah, and Doctor Sudarsan V.S. Ranganathan, unequivocally quantifies the degree to which online fantasy sports contests exhibit the predominance of skill.  The study found that the use of skill is more present in online fantasy sports contests than investing in mutual funds, which is a legally recognized activity in the State.  The study also found that not only did the data indicate a predominance of skill in online fantasy sports contests, but that luck may play more of a role in mutual fund management than in team selection in online fantasy sports contests because the variance in skill was higher in online fantasy sports contests than in mutual fund management. The legislature additionally finds that the revenue from online fantasy sports contests, not only from the general excise tax but also an additional online fantasy sports contests tax, could create additional funding for the State.  In addition to residents being able to participate in the highly regulated and recognized industry of online fantasy sports contests, visitors who are presently barred from participating would be able to continue to play in their leagues, which will provide a large stream of additional revenue for the State. The revenue generated through online fantasy sports contests could be used to grant funds with special concerns, such as for Lahaina community recovery efforts.  Furthermore, many highly-regulated entities that are platforms for online fantasy sports contests have offered to act as a common collector of tax revenue for the State, which will ensure a readily available stream of income that will be meticulously monitored, reported on, and held accountable to generally accepted accounting principles and other principles of oversight. The legislature further finds that aligning Hawaii with other states that provide a legal avenue for online fantasy sports contests will not affect the legality of sports book betting, which would remain illegal. The purpose of this Act is to legalize online fantasy sports contests in Hawaii by: (1)  Establishing an online fantasy sports contests registration and monitoring program under the department of the attorney general; (2)  Imposing an online fantasy sports contests tax; (3)  Establishing the online fantasy sports contests special fund and allocating proceeds of the fund for Lahaina community recovery efforts; (4)  Exempting registered online fantasy sports contests from state gambling laws; and (5)  Appropriating funds to the department of the attorney general to establish and implement a registration and monitoring program for online fantasy sports contests.
