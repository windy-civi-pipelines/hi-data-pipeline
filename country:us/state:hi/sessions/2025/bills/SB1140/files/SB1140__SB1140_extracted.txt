SB1140 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1140 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO INSURANCE OF LAST RESORT. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that fair access to insurance requirements programs, which are commonly called "FAIR plans", are state-mandated property insurance programs that fill a critical insurance market gap by offering coverage to individuals and businesses who are unable to obtain property insurance on the regular market.  Often used as an insurer of last resort, FAIR plans are especially important for properties that are considered high-risk or difficult to insure due to their location, age, or type of construction. The legislature further finds that state governments have experienced significant challenges in establishing and operating FAIR plans, including financial instability, administrative inefficiencies, and limited access to essential reinsurance markets.  These limitations have placed undue burdens on state resources and policyholders, leading to higher premiums, reduced overage options, and delays in claims processing. The legislature also finds that Hawaii's unique geographic location and natural risk profile necessitate a specialized approach to FAIR insurance.  Hawaii's insurance market benefits from the presence of insurance companies that are primarily domiciled within the State. These companies possess an inherent understanding of Hawaii's unique risk landscape and housing market. Unlike state-run programs, these local insurers already maintain the operational infrastructure, including experienced adjusters, claims processors, and support staff required to manage complex insurance needs effectively and efficiently. Additionally, local insurance companies have greater capacity to access and establish lines of reinsurance and other risk-sharing guarantees. This advantage allows these companies to respond rapidly to catastrophic events and stabilize premiums in high-risk areas. The State, while capable of providing some financial support, cannot always capitalize on reinsurance markets with the same agility as private entities having established industry relationships and networks. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish the fair access to insurance requirements program, which shall be administered by a private insurer and overseen by the department of commerce and consumer affairs, to give residents in high-risk areas an opportunity to purchase affordable and comprehensive property insurance coverage. SECTION 2. The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Chapter FAIR ACCESS TO INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS PROGRAM PART I.
