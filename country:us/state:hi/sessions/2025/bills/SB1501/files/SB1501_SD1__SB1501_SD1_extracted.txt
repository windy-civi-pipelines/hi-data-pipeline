Section 1:
SB1501 SD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1501 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO ENERGY. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that it is imperative to enable the development of affordable clean energy resources for the benefit of utility customers in the State.  Many existing generating units in Hawaii will need to be retired in the next few years due to obsolescence and environmental permitting requirements.  The impending retirement of these units makes it urgent to obtain replacement resources, without which the reliability of electrical supplies in the State will be at risk.  In addition, continued reliance on these aging units, even if feasible, would result in increased costs for utility customers and continued reliance on fossil fuels, contrary to the State's policy to transition to renewable, non-carbon-emitting resources. The procurement of replacement clean energy resources by a certain investor-owned electric utility and its electric utility subsidiaries is ongoing in its stage 3 request for proposals and further anticipated in its first integrated grid planning request for proposals.  These requests for proposals implement energy plans that are developed through extensive engagement with local stakeholders and communities and reviewed and approved by the public utilities commission.  The legislature finds that successful procurement of clean energy resources is in the public interest and necessary to avoid significant detrimental reliability and affordability impacts to electric utility customers. The legislature also finds that the development of clean energy resources by independent power producers is essential to achieve the State's goals of one hundred per cent net electricity sales from renewable sources by 2045, a zero emissions economy by 2045, and greater energy security and energy diversification, as established by the Hawaii State Planning Act and existing public utility laws. The legislature further finds that continued development of clean energy resources requires adequate assurances to independent power producers that prompt and full payments for purchased power will be made, irrespective of the financial strength of an electric utility.  The current sub‑investment‑grade status of a certain investor-owned electric utility and its subsidiaries, arising from the tragic events that occurred in the 2023 Maui wildfires, has led independent power producers, and those who would finance renewable energy projects, to raise concerns about the reliability of payment by the utility and its subsidiaries under new power purchase agreements.  Those concerns may cause independent power producers to cancel renewable energy projects or increase the prices they would charge for deliveries to address this perceived credit risk.  Either outcome would be contrary to the interests of electric utility customers in the State. The legislature further finds that the public interest could be served by the State providing limited credit support through step-in agreements, under which the State will agree to make payments to independent power producers in the event of a default in payment by an electric utility.  These agreements can provide assurances to independent power producers that prompt and full payments for purchased power will be made.  The legislature also finds that the intent of this Act is further served by appointing, authorizing, and empowering the electric utility to serve as the billing, collection, payment, and management agent of the State. The legislature also finds that the State's obligations in connection with step-in agreements do not constitute contingent liabilities of the State pursuant to article VII, section 13, clause 8, of the Hawaii State Constitution, because the State will be vested with all ownership of and title to revenues resulting from on-bill charges for power purchase costs, and the full faith and credit of the State will not be pledged for obligations under these step-in agreements. In the event of a default by an electric utility on its payment obligations, these revenues would cover all payment obligations of the State for electric energy and related products. In the absence of default, the electric utility will be authorized to utilize these revenues to discharge its obligations to pay independent power producers for electric energy and related products.  The obligations of the State under this Act are undertaken for a public purpose, namely, the protection of public health, safety, and welfare by supporting the development of clean energy resources that are needed for the reliable provision of electric supply at a reasonable cost. Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Allow the State to enter into step-in agreements for payment obligations arising under new power purchase agreements entered into between an investor‑owned electric utility and its regulated subsidiaries and independent power producers; (2)  Establish a trust fund within the State treasury that shall be capitalized immediately in the event of a default to fulfill state-backed payment obligations arising from power purchase agreements subject to step-in agreements; (3)  Establish that revenues from on-bill charges for covered power purchase agreements and accompanying reserves shall be held in trust by the State, and that independent power producers shall hold a beneficial interest in the revenues and reserves to the extent they are owed under the covered power purchase agreements; and (4)  Appoint, authorize, and empower an electric utility to serve as the billing, collection, payment, and management agent of the department of budget and finance in the service of performing step-in agreements. SECTION 2. Chapter 269, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part .  STEP-IN AGREEMENTS COVERING POWER PURCHASE COSTS §269-A  Definitions.  As used in this part: "Covered power purchase agreement" means a power purchase agreement that is subject to a step-in agreement. "Default" means the failure by an electric utility to pay power purchase costs when due to an obligee under a covered power purchase agreement after the expiration of any applicable grace or cure periods and extensions thereto.  "Default" does not mean a bankruptcy filing by an electric utility. "Department" means the department of budget and finance, or any successor by law. "Electric utility" means a public utility that produces, conveys, transmits, delivers, or furnishes electric power. "Energy cost recovery clause" means the provision, or other equivalent, in an electric utility's rate schedules that allows the electric utility to recover its costs of fuel, expenses, and related taxes for energy costs of power purchased under a power purchase agreement. "Fund" means the power purchase costs trust fund established pursuant to section 269-D. "Investment grade status" means a credit rating for the electric utility's senior unsecured long-term debt obligations or an issued credit rating for the electric utility (in each case, not supported by third party credit enhancements) from at least two out of the three of the following: (1)  At least BBB- or higher from S&P Global Ratings, or any successor by law; (2)  At least BAA3 or higher from Moody's Investor Services, Inc., or any successor by law; or (3)  At least BBB- or higher from Fitch Ratings, Inc., or any successor by law. "Obligee" means any user, owner, or operator of the Hawaii electric system that is owed payment of power purchase costs by the electric utility under a power purchase agreement. "Power purchase agreement" means a contract between an electric utility and a user, owner, or operator of the Hawaii electric system, approved by the public utilities commission, pursuant to which the electric utility agrees to purchase, and the user, owner, or operator of the Hawaii electric system agrees to sell, electric energy and related products produced by plants or facilities that have not provided, sold, or transmitted electricity to the electric utility before July 1, 2025. "Power purchase charges" means the on-bill charges authorized by the public utilities commission to be imposed on and collected from all existing and future customers of an electric utility or any successor for power purchase costs, including the energy cost recovery clause and the purchased power adjustment clause.  "Power purchase charges" do not include any amounts for state and county revenue taxes, including any franchise tax, public service company tax, and public utility commission fee. "Power purchase costs" means costs incurred by an electric utility pursuant to the terms of a power purchase agreement, including but not limited to termination payments payable by an electric utility in connection with the termination of a power purchase agreement as a result of a default by the electric utility.  "Power purchase costs" also include all categories of costs recoverable under the energy cost recovery clause and the purchased power adjustment clause under its respective tariffs in effect on July 1, 2025. "Purchased power adjustment clause" means the provision, or other equivalent, in an electric utility's rate schedules that allows the electric utility to recover expenses and related taxes for non-energy costs of power purchased under a power purchase agreement. "Step-in agreement" means a contract by which the State undertakes an obligation of prompt and full payment for power purchase costs owed to an obligee by an electric utility under a power purchase agreement following a default.

(b)  The department shall enter into a step-in agreement only if the power purchase agreement subject to the step-in agreement arises from the stage 3 request for proposals under docket number 2017-0352 before the public utilities commission or the first integrated grid planning request for proposals issued under docket number 2024-0258 before the public utilities commission.  The department shall enter into a step-in agreement when the power purchase agreement subject to the step-in agreement is executed, or if the power purchase agreement has already been executed as of July 1, 2025, as soon as reasonably possible. (c)  Payment by the department under a step-in agreement shall commence not later than two days after the date of a notice from the department to the electric utility pursuant to section 269-C(a). (d)  The step-in agreement shall terminate when the credit rating of the electric utility or its successor achieves investment grade status or by express agreement of the obligee. (e)  Following a default of a covered power purchase agreement and any payment by the department, the electric utility, within its sole discretion, may elect to resume payments for power purchase costs owed by the electric utility, regardless of the credit rating of the electric utility at that time, in which case the electric utility may use the revenue from power purchase charges as specified in subsection (h); provided that the payments shall not terminate the step-in agreement, which shall remain in effect until terminated pursuant to subsection (d), and the department shall remain obligated to pay the obligee upon a subsequent payment default by the electric utility. (f)  The department may impose other conditions, and may include other terms, in a step-in agreement that the department deems necessary to implement the requirements of this part; provided that the conditions and terms shall not adversely affect the obligation of the department to make prompt and full payments for power purchase costs owed by an electric utility to an obligee as and when due to a default as required under subsection (a) or otherwise be inconsistent with the covered power purchase agreement. (g)  As consideration for the State entering into the step‑in agreement, the electric utility or its successor shall enter into an agreement to assign and transfer any ownership in and title to the revenue from power purchase charges attributable to the covered power purchase agreement to the department, and, under the agreement, the department shall be deemed to be the sole holder in trust of all ownership and title to the revenue for the benefit of the obligees under the covered power purchase agreements to the extent the obliges are owed.  The revenue shall not be subject to appropriation for any other purpose.  The revenue, if held in a depository other than the state treasury, shall be exempt from the requirements of chapters 36 and 38.  The electric utility or its successor shall be obligated to bill and collect the power purchase charges and to manage the revenue attributable to the agreement as an agent for the department. (h)  Except in the case of any bankruptcy filing by an electric utility, if any payment obligation of the electric utility under a covered power purchase agreement for power purchase costs becomes owed and due, any ownership of or title to the revenue from power purchase charges for the payment obligation owed and due shall divest from the department and vest in the electric utility or its successor at the time the payment by the electric utility is made to the obligee. Any vesting of revenues to the electric utility when payment obligations are owed and due may be made without appropriation or allotment by the legislature.  The department may not otherwise assign, sell, or transfer any ownership of, or title to, any claim or right to the revenue from power purchase charges. (i) To meet the requirements of the State and the public utilities commission as it pertains to electric reliability, energy security, and energy diversification under this chapter and any rules adopted pursuant thereto, an electric utility shall ensure that it maintains sufficient availability of electric energy and related products, to the extent provided by an obligee in accordance with a covered power purchase agreement.  The department shall exercise its regulatory powers to ensure that an electric utility complies with its obligations under the covered power purchase agreements. (j)  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, an electric utility shall file with the public utilities commission, and the public utilities commission shall allow to become effective, monthly rate adjustments provided under the energy cost recovery clause and purchased power adjustment clause to establish or adjust power purchase charges in a manner designed to: (1)  Generate sufficient revenue to timely and fully pay amounts when owed and due under covered power purchase agreements; and (2)  Ensure that in no event shall revenues fall below the amounts owed and due under covered power purchase agreements by a sum that exceeds the amounts in the reserve established under section 269-E. To achieve the objectives established pursuant to this subsection, unless the public utilities commission otherwise directs, the electric utility may retain revenue collected in excess of amounts owed and due under the covered power purchase agreement.  The obligations of the electric utility and of the public utilities commission under this section shall survive any default by the electric utility and shall terminate only upon the termination of the step-in agreement as provided in subsection (d). (k)  If the electric utility fails to timely file any submission as described in subsection (j), the department shall promptly file, and the public utilities commission shall allow to become effective, a substitute submission as if the submission had been filed by the electric utility under subsection (j).  The electric utility shall implement the power purchase charges in the substitute submission from the department. §269-C  Default of electric utility; successor requirements. (a)  If the obligee provides notice to the department of a default of a covered power purchase agreement, the department shall provide the electric utility notice of the default.  Two days after the electric utility receives the notice, the electric utility shall turn over all revenues from power purchase charges arising from any covered power purchase agreements identified in the notice, regardless of when collected, then in its possession, and all future revenues from the power purchase charges thereafter collected, to the fund as directed by the department; provided that the amounts shall include revenues received by the electric utility after a default for power purchase charges billed before the default that were intended to be used to pay power purchase costs arising from the covered power purchase agreement.  The department shall use the revenue from the power purchase charges, including the revenues turned over, only in the order as follows: (1)  To pay power purchase costs pursuant to a step-in agreement, subject to the appointment, authorization, and empowerment of the electric utility as an agent as described in section 269-F(e); and (2)  To implement a rate credit to customers for revenue in excess of amounts owed under the covered power purchase agreement.

(c)  The obligation of an electric utility to collect and remit the power purchase charges pursuant to the requirements of this part shall not be subject to any setoff, counterclaim, surcharge, or defense by the electric utility, or in connection with a bankruptcy of any electric utility. (d)  Any successor to an electric utility shall be bound by the requirements of this part. The successor shall perform and satisfy all obligations of the electric utility in the same manner and to the same extent as the electric utility, including the obligation to bill and collect the power purchase charges and remit the collected revenue to the department in connection with any covered power purchase agreement, unless and until the step-in agreement is terminated as described in section 269‑B(d). (e)  If the credit rating of the electric utility or its successor achieves investment grade status, then by operation of law, any ownership of and title to the revenue from power purchase charges attributable to the covered power purchase agreement shall immediately divest from the department and vest in the electric utility or its successor; provided that the electric utility or its successor shall thereafter be the sole owner and holder of title or beneficial and equitable interest in, and any claim or right to, the revenue, and the obligation of the electric utility or its successor to bill and collect the power purchase charges and manage the revenue as an agent for the department, and, if applicable, to remit the collected revenue to the fund, shall terminate. §269-D  Power purchase costs trust fund.  (a)  There is established in the state treasury the power purchase costs trust fund into which shall be deposited all proceeds of the power purchase charges to be paid in the event of a default of a covered power purchase agreement by the electric utility. (b)  Moneys in the fund shall be administered and held by the department in trust for the benefit of obligees of covered power purchase agreements to the extent the obligees are owed. (c)  If the credit rating of the electric utility or its successor achieves investment grade status, the fund shall cease to receive any revenue from the power purchase charges collected by that electric utility and shall pay to the electric utility or its successor the remainder of any moneys in the fund; provided that the moneys in the fund shall be considered revenue of the electric utility. (d)  The department shall be under no obligation to make payment to any obligee if the moneys in the fund are depleted.  Any default or failure by the department to make payments pursuant to the terms of a step-in agreement under this part shall not result in any recourse by the electric utility or obligee to any funds of the State other than the revenues derived from power purchase charges and the subsidy for the reserve account collected and on deposit in the fund. §269-E Power purchase costs reserve fee; establishment.  (a)  By August 1, 2025, the public utilities commission shall authorize a surcharge proposed by an electric utility, referred to as the power purchase costs reserve fee, the revenue from which shall be accorded the same treatment as revenue from power purchase charges as described in section 269-B(g).  The power purchase costs reserve fee may be included in the purchased power adjustment clause on customer bills. (b) The power purchase costs reserve fee shall be collected and maintained to establish a reserve in an amount not to exceed fifteen per cent of the forecasted monthly power purchase costs of all covered power purchase agreements. (c) In the event of default pursuant to section 269-C(a), all previously collected revenues and all future revenues from the power purchase costs reserve fee shall be accorded the same treatment as revenues from power purchase charges as described in section 269-C. (d) Notwithstanding subsection (c), if the credit rating of the electric utility or its successor achieves investment grade status and the step-in agreement terminates pursuant to section 269-B(d), all moneys remaining in the reserve collected from the power purchase costs reserve fee shall be returned, together with any associated interest earned, to customers through a rate credit. (e) In the special circumstances of this part, the legislature finds and declares that the reasonable reserve requirement of article VII, section 13, clause 8 of the Hawaii State Constitution, to the extent applicable, has been satisfied. §269-F  Electric utility; agent of the department.  (a)  To implement the requirements of this part, the department may contract with an electric utility or its successor to act as an agent of the department to provide billing, collection, payment, management, and other related services on terms and conditions that reasonably compensate the electric utility or its successor for its incremental cost to provide services, and adequately secure payment to the department. (b)  At the request of the department, the public utilities commission shall order an electric utility or its successor to perform the duties pursuant to a contract under subsection (a). (c)  The act of serving as an agent to bill and to collect the power purchase charges shall not cause any electric utility to be subject to the laws that regulate financial institutions, escrow depositories, or collection agencies.  An electric utility shall not be responsible for lending, underwriting, and credit determinations in respect to these billing and collection activities. (d)  To the extent any moneys are received by an electric utility pursuant to subsection (a) or section 269-B(g), in the process of collection, and pending their transfer to the department, those moneys shall be held in trust for the department's exercise of its obligations pursuant to this part. (e)  To implement the requirements of this part, the director of finance may appoint, authorize, and empower the electric utility, as agent for and on behalf of the State, to manage and pay out moneys, including from the fund, for fulfillment of payment obligations of the State arising from covered power purchase agreements.  The appointment shall terminate when the step-in agreement for the covered power purchase agreements terminates pursuant to section 269-B(d)."

(i) To meet the requirements of the State and the public utilities commission as it pertains to electric reliability, energy security, and energy diversification under this chapter and any rules adopted pursuant thereto, an electric utility shall ensure that it maintains sufficient availability of electric energy and related products, to the extent provided by an obligee in accordance with a covered power purchase agreement.  The department shall exercise its regulatory powers to ensure that an electric utility complies with its obligations under the covered power purchase agreements. (j)  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, an electric utility shall file with the public utilities commission, and the public utilities commission shall allow to become effective, monthly rate adjustments provided under the energy cost recovery clause and purchased power adjustment clause to establish or adjust power purchase charges in a manner designed to: (1)  Generate sufficient revenue to timely and fully pay amounts when owed and due under covered power purchase agreements; and (2)  Ensure that in no event shall revenues fall below the amounts owed and due under covered power purchase agreements by a sum that exceeds the amounts in the reserve established under section 269-E. To achieve the objectives established pursuant to this subsection, unless the public utilities commission otherwise directs, the electric utility may retain revenue collected in excess of amounts owed and due under the covered power purchase agreement.  The obligations of the electric utility and of the public utilities commission under this section shall survive any default by the electric utility and shall terminate only upon the termination of the step-in agreement as provided in subsection (d). (k)  If the electric utility fails to timely file any submission as described in subsection (j), the department shall promptly file, and the public utilities commission shall allow to become effective, a substitute submission as if the submission had been filed by the electric utility under subsection (j).  The electric utility shall implement the power purchase charges in the substitute submission from the department. §269-C  Default of electric utility; successor requirements. (a)  If the obligee provides notice to the department of a default of a covered power purchase agreement, the department shall provide the electric utility notice of the default.  Two days after the electric utility receives the notice, the electric utility shall turn over all revenues from power purchase charges arising from any covered power purchase agreements identified in the notice, regardless of when collected, then in its possession, and all future revenues from the power purchase charges thereafter collected, to the fund as directed by the department; provided that the amounts shall include revenues received by the electric utility after a default for power purchase charges billed before the default that were intended to be used to pay power purchase costs arising from the covered power purchase agreement.  The department shall use the revenue from the power purchase charges, including the revenues turned over, only in the order as follows: (1)  To pay power purchase costs pursuant to a step-in agreement, subject to the appointment, authorization, and empowerment of the electric utility as an agent as described in section 269-F(e); and (2)  To implement a rate credit to customers for revenue in excess of amounts owed under the covered power purchase agreement. (b)  Any step-in agreement shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any bankruptcy, reorganization, or other insolvency proceedings with respect to the electric utility. (c)  The obligation of an electric utility to collect and remit the power purchase charges pursuant to the requirements of this part shall not be subject to any setoff, counterclaim, surcharge, or defense by the electric utility, or in connection with a bankruptcy of any electric utility. (d)  Any successor to an electric utility shall be bound by the requirements of this part. The successor shall perform and satisfy all obligations of the electric utility in the same manner and to the same extent as the electric utility, including the obligation to bill and collect the power purchase charges and remit the collected revenue to the department in connection with any covered power purchase agreement, unless and until the step-in agreement is terminated as described in section 269‑B(d). (e)  If the credit rating of the electric utility or its successor achieves investment grade status, then by operation of law, any ownership of and title to the revenue from power purchase charges attributable to the covered power purchase agreement shall immediately divest from the department and vest in the electric utility or its successor; provided that the electric utility or its successor shall thereafter be the sole owner and holder of title or beneficial and equitable interest in, and any claim or right to, the revenue, and the obligation of the electric utility or its successor to bill and collect the power purchase charges and manage the revenue as an agent for the department, and, if applicable, to remit the collected revenue to the fund, shall terminate. §269-D  Power purchase costs trust fund.  (a)  There is established in the state treasury the power purchase costs trust fund into which shall be deposited all proceeds of the power purchase charges to be paid in the event of a default of a covered power purchase agreement by the electric utility. (b)  Moneys in the fund shall be administered and held by the department in trust for the benefit of obligees of covered power purchase agreements to the extent the obligees are owed. (c)  If the credit rating of the electric utility or its successor achieves investment grade status, the fund shall cease to receive any revenue from the power purchase charges collected by that electric utility and shall pay to the electric utility or its successor the remainder of any moneys in the fund; provided that the moneys in the fund shall be considered revenue of the electric utility. (d)  The department shall be under no obligation to make payment to any obligee if the moneys in the fund are depleted.  Any default or failure by the department to make payments pursuant to the terms of a step-in agreement under this part shall not result in any recourse by the electric utility or obligee to any funds of the State other than the revenues derived from power purchase charges and the subsidy for the reserve account collected and on deposit in the fund. §269-E Power purchase costs reserve fee; establishment.  (a)  By August 1, 2025, the public utilities commission shall authorize a surcharge proposed by an electric utility, referred to as the power purchase costs reserve fee, the revenue from which shall be accorded the same treatment as revenue from power purchase charges as described in section 269-B(g).  The power purchase costs reserve fee may be included in the purchased power adjustment clause on customer bills. (b) The power purchase costs reserve fee shall be collected and maintained to establish a reserve in an amount not to exceed fifteen per cent of the forecasted monthly power purchase costs of all covered power purchase agreements. (c) In the event of default pursuant to section 269-C(a), all previously collected revenues and all future revenues from the power purchase costs reserve fee shall be accorded the same treatment as revenues from power purchase charges as described in section 269-C. (d) Notwithstanding subsection (c), if the credit rating of the electric utility or its successor achieves investment grade status and the step-in agreement terminates pursuant to section 269-B(d), all moneys remaining in the reserve collected from the power purchase costs reserve fee shall be returned, together with any associated interest earned, to customers through a rate credit. (e) In the special circumstances of this part, the legislature finds and declares that the reasonable reserve requirement of article VII, section 13, clause 8 of the Hawaii State Constitution, to the extent applicable, has been satisfied. §269-F  Electric utility; agent of the department.  (a)  To implement the requirements of this part, the department may contract with an electric utility or its successor to act as an agent of the department to provide billing, collection, payment, management, and other related services on terms and conditions that reasonably compensate the electric utility or its successor for its incremental cost to provide services, and adequately secure payment to the department. (b)  At the request of the department, the public utilities commission shall order an electric utility or its successor to perform the duties pursuant to a contract under subsection (a). (c)  The act of serving as an agent to bill and to collect the power purchase charges shall not cause any electric utility to be subject to the laws that regulate financial institutions, escrow depositories, or collection agencies.  An electric utility shall not be responsible for lending, underwriting, and credit determinations in respect to these billing and collection activities. (d)  To the extent any moneys are received by an electric utility pursuant to subsection (a) or section 269-B(g), in the process of collection, and pending their transfer to the department, those moneys shall be held in trust for the department's exercise of its obligations pursuant to this part. (e)  To implement the requirements of this part, the director of finance may appoint, authorize, and empower the electric utility, as agent for and on behalf of the State, to manage and pay out moneys, including from the fund, for fulfillment of payment obligations of the State arising from covered power purchase agreements.  The appointment shall terminate when the step-in agreement for the covered power purchase agreements terminates pursuant to section 269-B(d)."
