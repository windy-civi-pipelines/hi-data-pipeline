Section 1:
SB1245 HD2 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1245 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 2 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO PHARMACISTS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that there is currently a statewide physician shortage. According to the federal Health Resources and Services Administration, each county in the State contains a region that is a medically underserved area, as defined by the Public Health Service Act of 1944, Public Law 78‑410. The legislature further finds that pharmacists can help bridge the gaps created by the physician shortage.  A pharmacist's skill set includes educating patients on how and when to check blood sugar, ways to avoid and manage hypoglycemia, how to take their medications correctly to avoid adverse effects, and various medication utilization techniques.  Additionally, patients are significantly less likely to be readmitted to the hospital when pharmacists provide clinical services after a hospital discharge. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to require private and public health plans issued in the State to require coverage and payment or reimbursement for services provided by registered pharmacists within their scope of practice. SECTION 2.  Chapter 431, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to article 10A to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§431:10A-     Services provided by participating registered pharmacists; coverage.  (a)  For each individual or group policy of accident and health or sickness insurance delivered or issued for delivery in the State on or after January 1, 2026: (1)  Coverage for benefits for health care services provided by a registered pharmacist under this section shall not be denied if: (A)  The health care service was within the lawful scope of the registered pharmacist's license; (B)  The registered pharmacist is included in the insurer's network of participating providers; and (C)  A health care service is provided by a participating registered pharmacist practicing within the scope of the participating registered pharmacist's license for purposes of health maintenance or treatment and the policy provides coverage to the same extent as, and the insurer would have provided payment for, the same health care service provided by another health care provider; and (2)  The policy shall pay or reimburse a registered pharmacist or pharmacy for the cost of a service provided by a registered pharmacist within the scope of the registered pharmacist's practice. (b) The participation of registered pharmacists in a policy of accident and health or sickness insurance that includes coverage for prescription drug benefits shall not satisfy the requirement that insurers include contracted registered pharmacists in the insurer's network of participating providers. (c) The insurer shall not deny a registered pharmacist the ability to contract with the insurer if standard credentialing requirements are met, except for vertically integrated networks. (d) For policies that include coverage for prescription drug benefits and that are issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, insurers that delegate credentialing agreements to health care facilities shall accept credentialing for registered pharmacists employed or contracted by those facilities.  Insurers shall reimburse health care facilities for covered services provided by a participating registered pharmacist within the registered pharmacist's scope of practice per negotiations with the facility. (e)  For the purposes of this section, "participating registered pharmacist" means a registered pharmacist licensed pursuant to chapter 461 who has contracted with the insurer to provide health care services to its insureds." SECTION 3.  Chapter 432, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to article 1 to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§432:1-     Services provided by participating registered pharmacists; coverage.  (a)  For each individual or group hospital or medical service plan contract delivered or issued for delivery in the State on or after January 1, 2026: (1)  Coverage for benefits for health care services provided by a registered pharmacist under this section shall not be denied if: (A)  The health care service was within the lawful scope of the registered pharmacist's license; (B)  The registered pharmacist is included in the mutual benefit society's network of participating providers; and (C)  A health care service is provided by a participating registered pharmacist practicing within the scope of the participating registered pharmacist's license for purposes of health maintenance or treatment and the plan contract provides coverage to the same extent as, and the mutual benefit society would have provided payment for, the same health care service provided by another health care provider; and (2)  The plan contract shall pay or reimburse a registered pharmacist or pharmacy for the cost of a service provided by a registered pharmacist within the scope of the registered pharmacist's practice. (b) The participation of registered pharmacists in the hospital or medical service plan contract that includes coverage for prescription drug benefits shall not satisfy the requirement that mutual benefit societies include contracted registered pharmacists in the mutual benefit society's network of participating providers. (c) The mutual benefit society shall not deny a registered pharmacist the ability to contract with the mutual benefit society if standard credentialing requirements are met, except for vertically integrated networks. (d) For plan contracts that include coverage for prescription drug benefits and that are issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, mutual benefit societies that delegate credentialing agreements to health care facilities shall accept credentialing for registered pharmacists employed or contracted by those facilities.  Mutual benefit societies shall reimburse health care facilities for covered services provided by a participating registered pharmacist within the registered pharmacist's scope of practice per negotiations with the facility. (e)  For the purposes of this section, "participating registered pharmacist" means a registered pharmacist licensed pursuant to chapter 461 who has contracted with the mutual benefit society to provide health care services to its subscribers or members."

(b) The participation of registered pharmacists in the policy, contract, plan, or agreement that includes coverage for prescription drug benefits shall not satisfy the requirement that health maintenance organizations include contracted registered pharmacists in the health maintenance organization's network of participating providers. (c) The health maintenance organization shall not deny a registered pharmacist the ability to contract with the health maintenance organization if standard credentialing requirements are met, except for vertically integrated networks. (d) For policies, contracts, plans, or agreements that include coverage for prescription drug benefits and that are issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, health maintenance organizations that delegate credentialing agreements to health care facilities shall accept credentialing for registered pharmacists employed or contracted by those facilities.  Health maintenance organizations shall reimburse health care facilities for covered services provided by a participating registered pharmacist within the registered pharmacist's scope of practice per negotiations with the facility.
