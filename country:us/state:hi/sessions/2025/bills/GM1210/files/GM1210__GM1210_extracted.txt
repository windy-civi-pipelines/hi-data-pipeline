STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO INSURANCE.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that insurers doing
2 business in the State are required to provide written notice to
3 their customers on cancellation, but the current notice
4 requirement of ten days is unrealistic given the state of the
5 property casualty insurance market in Hawaii. Requiring
6 insurers to give notice at least twenty days before policy
7 cancellation ensures that policyholders have sufficient time to
8 secure alternative coverage and mitigates potential disruptions.
9 The legislature also finds that extending the notice period
10 promotes greater clarity and fairness in insurer-policyholder
11 relationships by establishing clear expectations and legal
12 assurances, thereby enabling consumers to make informed
13 decisions regarding their insurance coverage. Recognizing the
14 operational adjustments required to meet these new standards,
15 this Act provides for phased implementation to allow insurers
16 sufficient time to adapt. By enacting this measure, the
17 legislature emphasizes the importance of consumer protection

1 while fostering transparency, accountability, and fairness in
2 the insurance industry.
3 The purpose of this Act is to increase the notice period
4 for a property insurer to notify a policyholder of a
5 cancellation, including cancellation due to nonpayment, of a
6 policy of insurance on property used for residential purposes,
7 including multi-family residential purposes.
8 SECTION 2. Section 431:10-226.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes,
9 is amended to read as follows:
10 " [4] §431:10-226.5 [9-] Notice of cancellation or
11 nonrenewal [-»-- in] ; notice of cancellation or nonrenewal for
12 policies of property insurance. (a) Except as provided in
13 subsection (b), in the case of cancellation of a policy, the
14 insurer shall give written notice to the insured not fewer than
15 ten days------------ before the effective date of cancellation.
16 For nonrenewal of a policy, the insurer shall give written
17 notice to the insured not fewer than thirty days [p-r-ior to]
18 before the effective date of nonrenewal. If under title 24 or a
19 policy, a longer time period is required for a notice of
20 cancellation or nonrenewal for the policy, the longer period
21 shall be applicable. Cancellation or nonrenewal shall not be

4 insurance on property used for residential purposes, including
5 multi-family residential properties. In the case of
6 cancellation of a policy, the property insurer shall give
7 written notice to the insured not fewer than twenty days before
8 the effective date of cancellation. In the case of cancellation
9 of a policy due to nonpayment of premium or material
10 misrepresentation, the property insurer shall give written
11 notice to the insured not fewer than ten days before the
12 effective date of cancellation. For nonrenewal of a policy, the
13 property insurer shall give written notice to the insured not
14 fewer than thirty days before the effective date of nonrenewal.
15 If under title 24 or a policy, a longer time period is required
16 for a notice of cancellation or nonrenewal for the policy, the
17 longer period shall be applicable; provided that the longer
18 period shall be applicable only to the insurer. Cancellation or
19 nonrenewal shall not be deemed valid unless evidence of mailing
20 the written notice is provided."
