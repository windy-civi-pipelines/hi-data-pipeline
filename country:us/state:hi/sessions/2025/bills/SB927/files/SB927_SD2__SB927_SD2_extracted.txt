Section 1:
SB927 SD2 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 927 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO TRANSPORTATION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the dramatic increase in helicopter activity over the last two decades has led to a significant increase in flights over Hawaii resulting in increasing complaints from communities around the state.  Over that period of time numerous helicopter crashes and fatalities have occurred and continue to occur.  As a result, the legislature passed Act 311, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022 (Act 311), which required helicopter tour operators to report basic data about when and where operators are flying and established the Hawaii air noise and safety task force to convene stakeholders to address these concerns.  Subsequently, the helicopter industry sued to prevent the law from taking effect. The legislation further finds that the purpose of this part is to reconvene the Hawaii air noise and safety task force, pursuant to the intent of Act 311 in the Department of Transportation. Section 2.  (a) There is established an air noise and safety task force within the department of transportation for administrative purposes. (b) The air noise and safety task force shall: (1)  Collect and review public complaints regarding aircraft noise and safety; (2)  Identify key aircraft noise and safety issues affecting the State; (3)  Make recommendations that address aircraft noise and safety issues related to the Federal Aviation Administration National Transportation Safety Board and other appropriate federal agencies; (4)  Make recommendations that address business practices and aircraft operators falling within state and local jurisdiction; and (5)  Make recommendations that address aircraft noise and safety issues of aircraft operators. (c)  The members of the task force shall include: (1)  A member of the senate appointed by the president of the senate, who shall serve as a co-chair of the task force; (2)  A member of the house of representatives appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives, who shall serve as a co-chair of the task force; (3)  The director of transportation, or the director's designee; and (4)  The director of the office of planning and sustainable development, or the director's designee. (d) The co-chairs of the task force shall invite the following persons to join the task force: (1)  A representative from the Federal Aviation Administration; (2)  A representative from the National Transportation Safety Board; (3)  Not less than one representative from the helicopter industry; (4)  Not less than one representative from the small aircraft agency; and (5)  Representatives from communities impacted by aircraft noise or having safety concerns. (e)  The members of the task force shall serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for expenses, including travel expenses, necessary for the performance of their duties. (f) The task force shall submit a preliminary report of its findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, to the legislature no later than December 1, of each year. PART II SECTION 3. The legislature further finds that there have been incidents leading to unexpected and significant delays for travelers at Hawaii airports, as well as ongoing issues with security, labor, and overall traveler experience, as well as significant changes with airport stakeholders such as the merger of airlines and changing world travelling patterns since the COVID-19 pandemic.  To help address these issues, there should be convened an Airports Advisory Council to discuss these issues and in the short term develop plans and process with relevant stakeholders both in and outside airports for handling delays to ensure stakeholders in the hospitality and other industries are engaged and ready to smoothly handle unexpected disruptions, and in the long term examine other airports and evaluate other structures of design, planning, operations, and structure, such as corporations or other relevant considerations. The legislature finds that the purpose of this part is to establish an airports advisory council to provide a forum to identify and discuss potential improvements to airports, operations, disruptions, and structure. SECTION 4. (a)  There is established an airports advisory council to be placed within the department of transportation for administrative purposes only. (b) The airports advisory council shall: (1)  Provide an ongoing forum for coordinating relevant stakeholders and issues as they relate to airports, air transportation, and any other issues as may be appropriate; (2)  Develop plans and contingencies which may be updated as necessary, for each airport that provides for a coordinated response between airport stakeholders and others as may be relevant in the surrounding community to best accommodate travelers and employees in the event of significant disruptions, emergencies, and unexpected events; and (3)  Evaluate design consideration, operations, best practices, and other structures of management such as corporations at other national and international airports. (c)  The council shall be chaired by the deputy director of the airports division of the department of transportation, or the deputy director's designee, and shall be composed of airport and airline transportation stakeholders including but not limited to representatives invited by the chair of relevant: (1)  Airlines; (2)  Labor Unions; (3)  Concessions; (4)  Hospitality; (5)  Airport related law enforcement; (6)  Chairs of the senate and house of representatives committees with jurisdiction over air transportation; and (7)  Any other stakeholders the chair deems to be relevant. SECTION 5. (a)  The department of transportation may, through the adoption of administrative rules pursuant to chapter 91, Hawaii Revised Statutes, designate an airport security area within an airport property. (b)  A designated airport security area shall be identified by posted and visible signage at reasonable intervals, that shall include any rules specific to the airport security area. (c)  Within a designated airport security area, the department of transportation may: (1)  Restrict or limit public access, including by date or time; (2)  Restrict or limit the maintaining, placing, or leaving of personal property in a public right of way; (3)  Restrict or limit standing, sitting, or laying in a public right of way; and (4)  Restrict or limit public access by an individual to not more than a specified duration of time. SECTION 6. There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the establishment of the airports advisory council.
