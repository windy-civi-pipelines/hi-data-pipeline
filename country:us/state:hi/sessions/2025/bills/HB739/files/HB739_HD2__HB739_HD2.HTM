HB739 HD2 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 739 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO HOUSING. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii is in the midst of a crisis as a substantial number of residents are unable to secure attainable housing to rent or to own. The exorbitant cost of real estate renders homeownership unattainable for many local families, with the average price of a home in Hawaii surpassing $800,000, an amount considerably beyond the financial reach of most local working residents. The legislature further finds that Hawaii has been struggling with outmigration as local working residents are compelled to leave the islands in search of more affordable living situations.  The department of business, economic development, and tourism reported that between July 1, 2022, and July 1, 2023, an average of twelve people departed from Hawaii each day.  As a result, for the first time in history, a greater number of Native Hawaiians reside outside of Hawaii than in it.  This exodus signifies a loss not only of population but also of cultural heritage. A recent study of nearly fifteen hundred local working residents conducted by Holomua Collective found that seventy per cent of respondents plan to leave or are considering leaving Hawaii as they cannot afford to live here.  Nearly half of that seventy per cent plan to move within the next five years. The legislature also finds that another crucial aspect of Hawaii's housing crisis is the shortage of attainable workforce housing for essential workers like teachers, police officers, health care providers, and others who serve the community.  With limited attainable workforce housing options and high building costs, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find suitable places for these workers to live, driving crucial workers to relocate to the continent.  Allowing people to live closer to where they work will help preserve infrastructure, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve workers' mental health, and help businesses by reducing commute times. The legislature additionally finds that like Hawaii, the town of Vail, Colorado has a tourism-based economy in which local working residents struggle to find attainable housing in part due to the large percentage of vacant homes owned by non-residents.  In 2018, in an attempt to provide for local workforce housing and invest in the future of its town, the town of Vail implemented "Vail InDEED", a voluntary program that allowed the town to buy and place deed restrictions in perpetuity on local homes from willing buyers that limited occupancy to owner-occupants or resident tenants that live and work in the town of Vail.  Since 2018, the program has resulted in the establishment of over one thousand deed restricted residences for local working residents, helped provide more attainable housing options for local working residents, and created a culture in which Vail residents want to live in and support the deed restricted residences. The legislature believes Hawaii can learn from the town of Vail, and that a program similar to Vail InDEED could develop a stock of homes in Hawaii that are dedicated to locals.  This program could be effective in helping local families buy homes by bringing together the needs of employers, workers, and the community.  Prioritizing workforce housing that ensures occupants live or work in the vicinity of their home will help alleviate the shortage of workforce housing, reduce traffic and emissions of greenhouse gases, mitigate adverse impacts from new development, and build stronger communities. Additionally, this program would not only aid people in securing housing but would also contribute to the preservation of Hawaiis distinctive culture by ensuring that local families remain in the State. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish and fund the kamaaina homes program as an investment in the future of Hawaii and keep local working families in the State by securing a dedicated housing supply specifically for locals. SECTION 2.  Chapter 201H, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new subpart to part III to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "   .  Kamaaina Homes Program §201H-A  Definitions.  As used in this subpart, unless the context otherwise requires: "Eligible homeowner or homebuyer" means a person or family, without regard to race, creed, national origin, or sex, who: (1)  Is a citizen of the United States or a resident alien; (2)  Is a resident domiciled in the State; (3)  Is at least eighteen years of age; (4)  Agrees to sell to the county and place a deed restriction on the property that is in compliance with section 201H-C; (5)  Agrees to comply with annual reporting requirements pursuant to section 201H-F; (6)  Owns no other property with a deed restriction pursuant to this subpart; and (7)  Meets any other qualifications as established by rules adopted by the corporation or county.
