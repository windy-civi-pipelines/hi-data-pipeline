STATE OF HAWAII
A BILL FORAN ACT
RELATING TO WITNESS FEES.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the ability to call
2 upon witnesses is an important factor in whether justice can
3 effectively be served. The fee currently paid to witnesses has
4 never been raised from $4. The federal government and several
5 states pay and reimburse witnesses at higher rates than existing
6 law in the State permits.
7 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
8 (1) Increase the fees paid to witnesses in civil and
9 criminal trials;
10 (2) Change the fees paid for travel expenses from 20 cents
11 a mile to the mileage allowance prescribed by the
12 Administrator of General Services; and
13 (3) Authorize reimbursement to witnesses in civil trials
14 for use of common carriers.
15 SECTION 2. Section 607-12, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
16 amended to read as follows:
