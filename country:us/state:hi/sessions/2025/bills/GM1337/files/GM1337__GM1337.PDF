A BILL FORAN ACT
RELATING TO AGRICULTURE.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 PART I
2 SECTION 1. This Act shall be known and may be cited as
3 "Duke's Law" in memory of Cranston "Duke" Pia.
4 SECTION 2. The legislature finds that agricultural crimes
5 pose a significant and growing threat to the sustainability and
6 vitality of the State's agricultural industry. These crimes,
7 which include homicide, terroristic threatening, theft,
8 vandalism, trespassing, and illegal hunting on agricultural
9 lands, not only jeopardize the livelihoods of farmers but also
10 undermine food security, disrupt local economies, and erode
11 public confidence in the protection of vital resources.
12 Agriculture remains a cornerstone of the State's economy and
13 cultural heritage, contributing to both economic diversification
14 and community resilience. However, the increasing prevalence of
15 agricultural crimes poses a grave risk to this essential sector.
16 The legislature further finds that unauthorized hunting
17 also significantly impacts agricultural lands. Livestock

1 endangerment and losses are common when unpermitted hunters
2 disturb farm animals on agricultural lands, and accidental
3 shootings, noise-related stress, and damaged enclosures put
4 livestock at risk, leading to financial losses for farmers and
5 ranchers. Additionally, the erosion of landowner rights and
6 agricultural stability are also critical concerns, as farmers
7 and ranchers depend on private property rights to maintain
8 secure and productive operations. Unauthorized hunting
9 disregards these rights, undermining responsible land
10 stewardship.
11 Recognizing the complexity and multifaceted nature of
12 agricultural.crimes, this Act is designed to provide a
15 comprehensive response by strengthening existing legal
14 frameworks and establishing clearer definitions and penalties
15 for violations related to agriculture and agricultural lands.
16 By differentiating between administrative and criminal
17 penalties, this Act ensures that the consequences of
18 agricultural crimes are proportionate and effective, thereby
19 enhancing deterrence and accountability.
20 The legislature affirms its commitment to preserving the
21 State's agricultural legacy and protecting the individuals and

1 communities who dedicate themselves to this critical industry.
2 Through this Act, the State seeks to ensure the safety,
3 integrity, and sustainability of the State's agricultural lands
4 for present and future generations.
5 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
6 (1) Establish an agricultural enforcement pilot program
7 within the department of law enforcement on the
8 islands of Oahu and Hawaii, to be implemented at the
9 discretion of the deputy director of law enforcement;
10 (2) Appropriate funds for and establish positions within
11 the agricultural enforcement pilot program;
12 (3) Clarify, create, and strengthen laws regarding crimes
13 and violations related to agriculture or agricultural
14 lands and hunting on private agricultural lands; and
15 (4) Establish clear distinctions between administrative
16 and criminal penalties.
17 PART II

C.D. 1
A BILL FORAN ACT
RELATING TO AGRICULTURE.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 PART I
2 SECTION 1. This Act shall be known and may be cited as
3 "Duke's Law" in memory of Cranston "Duke" Pia.
4 SECTION 2. The legislature finds that agricultural crimes
5 pose a significant and growing threat to the sustainability and
6 vitality of the State's agricultural industry. These crimes,
7 which include homicide, terroristic threatening, theft,
8 vandalism, trespassing, and illegal hunting on agricultural
9 lands, not only jeopardize the livelihoods of farmers but also
10 undermine food security, disrupt local economies, and erode
11 public confidence in the protection of vital resources.
12 Agriculture remains a cornerstone of the State's economy and
13 cultural heritage, contributing to both economic diversification
14 and community resilience. However, the increasing prevalence of
15 agricultural crimes poses a grave risk to this essential sector.
16 The legislature further finds that unauthorized hunting
17 also significantly impacts agricultural lands. Livestock

H.D. 2
C.D. 1
1 endangerment and losses are common when unpermitted hunters
2 disturb farm animals on agricultural lands, and accidental
3 shootings, noise-related stress, and damaged enclosures put
4 livestock at risk, leading to financial losses for farmers and
5 ranchers. Additionally, the erosion of landowner rights and
6 agricultural stability are also critical concerns, as farmers
7 and ranchers depend on private property rights to maintain
8 secure and productive operations. Unauthorized hunting
9 disregards these rights, undermining responsible land
10 stewardship.
11 Recognizing the complexity and multifaceted nature of
12 agricultural.crimes, this Act is designed to provide a
15 comprehensive response by strengthening existing legal
