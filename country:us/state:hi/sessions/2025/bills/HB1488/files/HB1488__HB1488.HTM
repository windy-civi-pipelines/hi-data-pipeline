Section 1:
HB1488 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1488 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to homelessness. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that homelessness has and continues to remain a persistent problem throughout the State.  To address homelessness in the State, the department of human services' homeless programs office contracts with homeless service providers to provide homeless outreach, shelter, case management, and all of the attendant services to transition homeless individuals from the street to transitional housing and ultimately to some form of supportive or permanent housing. The legislature further finds that except for an appropriation made in the regular session of 2024 for a five per cent budget increase, there has been no increase in funding for the department of human services' homeless service contracts for over ten years, even as costs for wages, utilities, and all administrative services of running all businesses have increased.  Additionally, the five per cent increase into the base budget of the homeless programs office in 2024 was insufficient to cover full program costs and the rising costs of living for providers. As a result, homeless service providers contracted with the homeless programs office have attempted to fill funding shortfalls through their own fundraising efforts but can no longer bridge the expanding gap.  If state funding is not increased to meet actual service delivery costs, contracted homeless service providers will be forced to either decline contracts or reduce essential services, despite rising community needs. The purpose of this Act is to increase the base budget of the department of human services' homeless programs office to address the need for homeless services and ensure that these organizations can address the high cost of living for their employees so that the critical work with Hawaii's homeless populations is maintained. SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $8,175,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 for homeless programs in the State; provided that the appropriated amount shall be in addition to the homeless programs office's base budget of $27,250,000 for fiscal year 2025-2026. The sums appropriated shall be expended by the department of human services for the purposes of this Act. SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2025. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: Homeless Services; Department of Human Services; Homeless Programs Office; Appropriation Description: Appropriates funds in addition to the base budget of the Department of Human Services' Homeless Programs Office to address the need for homeless services in the State.
