SECTION 3. Section 328L-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows: "(b) All interest earned from moneys in the emergency and budget reserve fund shall be credited to the emergency and budget reserve fund[.]; provided that if the accrual of interest would cause the balance of the emergency and budget reserve fund to exceed the fund balance objective set for the emergency and budget reserve fund, as established in administrative directive number 22-01, then: (1)  Any interest amounts that would cause the fund's balance to exceed the fund balance objective shall be credited to the general fund; and (2)  The governor, in the following fiscal year, shall request that an amount of general funds equal to the amount of interest deposited into the general fund pursuant to paragraph (1) be expended to advance specific projects that address climate change, pursuant to section 37-   ."
