(b)  All rules, policies, procedures, guidelines, and other material adopted or developed by the department of land and natural resources relating to the existing leases in the Waiakea community development district shall remain in full force and effect until superseded, amended, or repealed, pursuant to chapter 91, Hawaii Revised Statutes, by the Hawaii community development authority except as otherwise authorized, directed, or instructed by this Act.  Effective upon the completed transfer of the lands and leases, every reference to the department of land and natural resources or the board of land and natural resources in those rules, policies, procedures, guidelines, and other material shall be construed as a reference to the Hawaii community development authority as applicable. (c)  All appropriations to the department of land and natural resources, records, deeds, leases, contracts, loans, agreements, permits, or other documents heretofore made, used, acquired, held by, executed or entered into by or on behalf of the department of land and natural resources relating to the transferred land or leases in the Waiakea community development district shall remain in full force and effect until amended.  Effective upon the completed transfer of the lands and leases, every reference to the department of land and natural resources or the board of land and natural resources in those appropriations, records, deeds, leases, contracts, loans, agreements, permits, or other documents relating to the transferred land or leases in the Waiakea community development district shall be construed as a reference to the Hawaii community development authority as applicable.
