Section 1:
HB769 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 769 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to elections. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the current campaign finance system is perceived to favor wealthy donors who may unduly influence candidates and elected officials through campaign donations.  Campaign programs that are publicly funded are intended to improve the election process by giving candidates the option to campaign without the use of private funds and allowing elected officials to make decisions without any undue influence by other entities. The legislature further finds that a democracy voucher program is a method of public financing that provides individuals with a certain number of vouchers that have monetary value, funded by taxpayer dollars, and can be pledged to eligible candidates.  A democracy voucher program was approved for use in Seattle, Washington through a 2015 citywide referendum, and since the program's approval, millions of dollars in public funding have been used for local elections, with Seattle voters allocating nearly 95,000 vouchers, worth almost $2,400,000, to fund local city council elections, supporting over thirty different campaigns.  The establishment of a similar democracy voucher program in the State will help to bolster public confidence in the State's election process and encourage new candidates and more elected officials to campaign without the influence of private donations. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish a voluntary democracy dollars program to provide vouchers to certain residents of the State that can be used to make contributions to qualified candidates. SECTION 2.  Chapter 11, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new subpart to part XIII to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "   . Democracy Dollars Program §11-A  Purpose.
