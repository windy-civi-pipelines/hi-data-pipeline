C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO ELECTRIC VEHICLE BATTERIES.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that electric vehicle
2 usage in the State has grown dramatically, with a twenty-three
3 per cent increase in the number of registered electric vehicles
4 from October 2023 to October 2024. As electric vehicle usage
5 increases, more electric vehicle batteries will enter the waste
6 stream. Proper recycling and disposal practices are needed to
7 ensure that electric vehicle batteries do not contribute to
8 environmental harm.
9 The purpose of this Act is to establish a working group to
10 examine how to maximize the recycling and reuse of electric
11 vehicle batteries and recommend electric vehicle battery
12 management practices.
13 SECTION 2. (a) There is established within the Hawaii
14 state energy office an electric vehicle battery recycling and
15 reuse working group to examine how to maximize the recycling and
16 reuse of electric vehicle batteries and recommend electric
17 vehicle battery management practices.
