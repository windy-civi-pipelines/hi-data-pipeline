SB1373 HD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1373 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO ADMINISTRATIVE LICENSURE ACTIONS AGAINST SEX OFFENDERS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that an October 2024 Civil Beat article highlighted the inability of state licensing boards and agencies to promptly revoke the professional licenses of registered sex offenders.  The legislature believes that timely action in cases where certain professional license, registration, or certification holders are registered sex offenders is a vital aspect of consumer protection.  Delayed action in revoking a license, registration, or certification and preventing further practice by a registered sex offender places consumers at unnecessary risk. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Require the board of acupuncture, athletic trainer program, board of barbering and cosmetology, Hawaii board of chiropractic, board of dentistry, electrologist program, hearing aid dealer and fitter program, marriage and family therapist licensing program, state board of massage therapy, Hawaii medical board, mental health counselors licensing program, state board of naturopathic medicine, state board of nursing, nurse aide program, nursing home administrator program, occupational therapy program, midwives licensing program, dispensing opticians program, board of optometry, board of pharmacy, board of physical therapy, board of psychology, behavior analyst program, respiratory therapist program, social worker licensing program, and state board of speech pathology and audiology to automatically revoke and deny the renewal, restoration, or reinstatement of a license, registration, or certification to a person who is a registered sex offender; (2)  Establish conditions for the disciplinary action; and (3)  Ensure consumer protection by requiring any final order of discipline taken to be public record. SECTION 2.  Chapter 436E, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§436E-     Revocation of license or denial of application to renew, restore, or reinstate a license based on conviction as a registered sex offender; conditions.  (a)  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the board shall automatically revoke a license or deny an application to renew, restore, or reinstate a license under either of the following circumstances: (1)  The licensee is convicted in any court in or outside of this State of any offense that, if committed or attempted in this State, based on the elements of the convicted offense, would have been punishable as one or more of the offenses described in chapter 846E; or (2)  The licensee is required to register as a sex offender pursuant to the requirements of chapter 846E, regardless of whether the related conviction has been appealed. (b)  The board shall notify the licensee of the license revocation or denial of application to renew, restore, or reinstate the license and of the right to elect to have a hearing as provided in subsection (c). (c)  Upon revocation of the license or denial of an application to renew, restore, or reinstate, the licensee may file a written request for a hearing with the board within ten days of the notice.  The hearing shall be held within thirty days of the revocation or denial.  The proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with chapter 91. (d)  For the purposes of enforcement of this section, a plea or verdict of guilty, or a conviction after a plea of nolo contendere, shall be deemed a conviction.  The record of conviction shall be conclusive evidence of the fact that the conviction occurred. (e)  If the related conviction of the licensee is overturned upon appeal, the revocation or denial ordered pursuant to this section shall automatically cease.  Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the board from pursuing disciplinary action based on any cause other than the overturned conviction. (f)  Any final order of discipline taken pursuant to this section shall be a matter of public record. (g)  The board shall not restore, renew, or otherwise reinstate the license of a person when: (1)  The person has been required to register as a sex offender pursuant to the requirements of chapter 846E, regardless of whether the conviction has been appealed; and (2)  The victim of the covered offense was a patient or client, or a former patient or client, if the relationship was terminated primarily for the purpose of committing the covered offense."

SB1373 HD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1373 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO ADMINISTRATIVE LICENSURE ACTIONS AGAINST SEX OFFENDERS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that an October 2024 Civil Beat article highlighted the inability of state licensing boards and agencies to promptly revoke the professional licenses of registered sex offenders.  The legislature believes that timely action in cases where certain professional license, registration, or certification holders are registered sex offenders is a vital aspect of consumer protection.  Delayed action in revoking a license, registration, or certification and preventing further practice by a registered sex offender places consumers at unnecessary risk. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Require the board of acupuncture, athletic trainer program, board of barbering and cosmetology, Hawaii board of chiropractic, board of dentistry, electrologist program, hearing aid dealer and fitter program, marriage and family therapist licensing program, state board of massage therapy, Hawaii medical board, mental health counselors licensing program, state board of naturopathic medicine, state board of nursing, nurse aide program, nursing home administrator program, occupational therapy program, midwives licensing program, dispensing opticians program, board of optometry, board of pharmacy, board of physical therapy, board of psychology, behavior analyst program, respiratory therapist program, social worker licensing program, and state board of speech pathology and audiology to automatically revoke and deny the renewal, restoration, or reinstatement of a license, registration, or certification to a person who is a registered sex offender; (2)  Establish conditions for the disciplinary action; and (3)  Ensure consumer protection by requiring any final order of discipline taken to be public record. SECTION 2.  Chapter 436E, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§436E-     Revocation of license or denial of application to renew, restore, or reinstate a license based on conviction as a registered sex offender; conditions.  (a)  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the board shall automatically revoke a license or deny an application to renew, restore, or reinstate a license under either of the following circumstances: (1)  The licensee is convicted in any court in or outside of this State of any offense that, if committed or attempted in this State, based on the elements of the convicted offense, would have been punishable as one or more of the offenses described in chapter 846E; or (2)  The licensee is required to register as a sex offender pursuant to the requirements of chapter 846E, regardless of whether the related conviction has been appealed. (b)  The board shall notify the licensee of the license revocation or denial of application to renew, restore, or reinstate the license and of the right to elect to have a hearing as provided in subsection (c). (c)  Upon revocation of the license or denial of an application to renew, restore, or reinstate, the licensee may file a written request for a hearing with the board within ten days of the notice.  The hearing shall be held within thirty days of the revocation or denial.  The proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with chapter 91. (d)  For the purposes of enforcement of this section, a plea or verdict of guilty, or a conviction after a plea of nolo contendere, shall be deemed a conviction.  The record of conviction shall be conclusive evidence of the fact that the conviction occurred. (e)  If the related conviction of the licensee is overturned upon appeal, the revocation or denial ordered pursuant to this section shall automatically cease.  Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the board from pursuing disciplinary action based on any cause other than the overturned conviction. (f)  Any final order of discipline taken pursuant to this section shall be a matter of public record. (g)  The board shall not restore, renew, or otherwise reinstate the license of a person when: (1)  The person has been required to register as a sex offender pursuant to the requirements of chapter 846E, regardless of whether the conviction has been appealed; and (2)  The victim of the covered offense was a patient or client, or a former patient or client, if the relationship was terminated primarily for the purpose of committing the covered offense."
