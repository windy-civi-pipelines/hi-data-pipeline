Failure or refusal to file a statement, including the agreement and waiver, [is] shall be a violation of this section and may, in the discretion of the department, be sufficient cause for refusing to permit the entry of the articles into the State; (7)  Place of inspection.  If, in the judgment of the inspector, it is deemed necessary or advisable to move any of the [above-mentioned] articles[,] mentioned in this section, or any portion thereof, to a place more suitable for inspection than the pier, airport, or any other place where they are first received or discharged, the inspector [is] shall be authorized to do so.  All costs and expenses incident to the movement and transportation of the articles to any other place shall be borne by the importer or the importer's agent.  If the importer, importer's agent, or transportation company requests inspection of sealed containers of the [above-mentioned] articles mentioned in this section at locations other than where the articles are first received or discharged and the department determines that inspection at the other place is appropriate, the department may require payment of costs necessitated by these inspections, including overtime costs; (8)  Disinfection or quarantine.  If, upon inspection, any article received or brought into the State for the purpose of debarkation or entry therein is found to be infested or infected or there is reasonable cause to presume that it is infested or infected and the infestation or infection can, in the judgment of the inspector, be eradicated, a treatment shall be given [such] to the article.  The treatment shall be at the expense of the owner or the owner's agent, and the treatment shall be as prescribed by the department.  The article shall be held in quarantine at the expense of the owner or the owner's agent at a satisfactory place approved by the department for a sufficient length of time to determine that eradication has been accomplished.  If the infection or infestation [or infection] is of the nature or extent that it cannot be effectively and completely eradicated, or if it is a potentially destructive pest or it is not widespread in the State, or after treatment it is determined that the infection or infestation [or infection] is not completely eradicated, or if the owner or [the] owner's agent refuses to allow the article to be treated or refuses to be responsible for the cost of treatment and quarantine, the article, or any portion thereof, [together] with all packing and containers, may, at the discretion of the inspector, be destroyed or sent out of the State at the expense of the owner or [the] owner's agent.  The destruction or exclusion shall not be made the basis of a claim against the department or the inspector for damage or loss incurred; (9)  Disposition.  Upon completion of inspection, either at the time of arrival or at any time thereafter should any article be held for inspection, treatment, or quarantine, the inspector shall affix to the article or [the] container or to the delivery order in a conspicuous place thereon, a [tag,] label, [or] stamp, or tag to indicate that the article has been inspected and passed. This action shall constitute a permit to bring the article into the State; and (10)  Ports of entry.  None of the articles mentioned in this section shall be allowed entry into the State except through the airports and seaports in the State designated and approved by the board."

Baggage or cargo inspection shall be made at the discretion of the inspector, on the aircraft, pier, or vessel[, or aircraft] or in any quarantine or inspection area. Whenever the inspector has good cause to believe that the provisions of this chapter are being violated, the inspector may require that any box, package, suitcase, or any other container carried as ship's stores, cargo, or otherwise by any aircraft or vessel [or aircraft] moving between the continental United States and Hawaii or between the [Hawaiian Islands,] islands of the State, be opened for inspection to determine whether any article or pest prohibited by this chapter or by rules adopted pursuant thereto is present.  It [is] shall be a violation of this section if any prohibited article or any pest or any plant, fruit, or vegetable infested with plant pests is found; (6)  Request for importation and inspection.  In addition to requirements of the United States customs authorities concerning invoices or other formalities incident to importations into the State, the importer shall be required to file a written statement with the department, signed by the importer or the importer's agent, setting forth the importer's desire to import certain of the [above-mentioned] articles mentioned in this section into the State and: (A)  Giving the following additional information: (i)  The kind (scientific name), quantity, and description; (ii)  The locality where same were grown or produced; (iii)  Certification that all animals to be imported are the progeny of captive populations or have been held in captivity for a period of one year immediately before importation or have been specifically approved for importation by the board; (iv)  The port from which the same were last shipped; (v)  The name of the shipper; and (vi)  The name of the consignee; and (B)  Containing: (i)  A request that the department, by its duly authorized agent, examine the articles described; (ii)  An agreement by the importer to be responsible for all costs, charges, or expenses; and (iii)  A waiver of all claims for damages incident to the inspection or the fumigation, disinfection, quarantine, or destruction of the articles, or any of them, as hereinafter provided, if any treatment is deemed necessary. Failure or refusal to file a statement, including the agreement and waiver, [is] shall be a violation of this section and may, in the discretion of the department, be sufficient cause for refusing to permit the entry of the articles into the State; (7)  Place of inspection.  If, in the judgment of the inspector, it is deemed necessary or advisable to move any of the [above-mentioned] articles[,] mentioned in this section, or any portion thereof, to a place more suitable for inspection than the pier, airport, or any other place where they are first received or discharged, the inspector [is] shall be authorized to do so.  All costs and expenses incident to the movement and transportation of the articles to any other place shall be borne by the importer or the importer's agent.  If the importer, importer's agent, or transportation company requests inspection of sealed containers of the [above-mentioned] articles mentioned in this section at locations other than where the articles are first received or discharged and the department determines that inspection at the other place is appropriate, the department may require payment of costs necessitated by these inspections, including overtime costs; (8)  Disinfection or quarantine.  If, upon inspection, any article received or brought into the State for the purpose of debarkation or entry therein is found to be infested or infected or there is reasonable cause to presume that it is infested or infected and the infestation or infection can, in the judgment of the inspector, be eradicated, a treatment shall be given [such] to the article.  The treatment shall be at the expense of the owner or the owner's agent, and the treatment shall be as prescribed by the department.  The article shall be held in quarantine at the expense of the owner or the owner's agent at a satisfactory place approved by the department for a sufficient length of time to determine that eradication has been accomplished.  If the infection or infestation [or infection] is of the nature or extent that it cannot be effectively and completely eradicated, or if it is a potentially destructive pest or it is not widespread in the State, or after treatment it is determined that the infection or infestation [or infection] is not completely eradicated, or if the owner or [the] owner's agent refuses to allow the article to be treated or refuses to be responsible for the cost of treatment and quarantine, the article, or any portion thereof, [together] with all packing and containers, may, at the discretion of the inspector, be destroyed or sent out of the State at the expense of the owner or [the] owner's agent.  The destruction or exclusion shall not be made the basis of a claim against the department or the inspector for damage or loss incurred; (9)  Disposition.  Upon completion of inspection, either at the time of arrival or at any time thereafter should any article be held for inspection, treatment, or quarantine, the inspector shall affix to the article or [the] container or to the delivery order in a conspicuous place thereon, a [tag,] label, [or] stamp, or tag to indicate that the article has been inspected and passed. This action shall constitute a permit to bring the article into the State; and (10)  Ports of entry.  None of the articles mentioned in this section shall be allowed entry into the State except through the airports and seaports in the State designated and approved by the board." PART IV SECTION 11.  Chapter 150A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding two new sections to part VI to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§150A-A  Biosecurity emergency.  (a)  The department, with the approval of the governor, may declare a biosecurity emergency if: (1)  There has been in the State an outbreak or occurrence of a pest or prohibited or restricted organism that has the potential to cause significant economic or environmental loss if the pest or organism becomes established in the State; (2)  There is established in one area of the State a pest or prohibited or restricted organism that has the potential to cause significant economic or environmental loss if the pest or organism expands to other areas within a county or becomes established in another area of the State; or (3)  A pest or prohibited or restricted organism is, or threatens to be, beyond the State's ability to control. (b)  A biosecurity emergency shall automatically terminate one hundred calendar days after its declaration, unless the declaration is extended by the department with the approval of the governor. (c)  For the duration of a declared biosecurity emergency: (1)  The department shall be exempt from chapter 103D; (2)  The Hawaii invasive species council shall work with the chairperson; and (3)  The governor may transfer moneys to the department from any account within the governor's control. (d)  The governor may requisition and take control of any goods, real property, or watercraft required for the purposes of this section, or requisition and take control of the temporary use thereof; provided that: (1)  This subsection shall not apply to any vessel that: (A)  Has anti-fouling hull coating; and (B)  Does not discharge ballast water, uses freshwater for ballasting, or is equipped with ultraviolet filtration systems for ballast water; (2)  The requisition shall be made by serving notice upon any person found in occupation of the premises or having the property in the person's custody, possession, or control, and a like notice shall also be served upon any person who has filed with the governor, or with a person the governor designates for the purpose, a request for notice with respect to the property; provided further that if any person entitled to compensation for the property is unable to be served, the governor shall publish a notice of the requisition at the earliest practicable date; and (3)  A requisition shall terminate automatically one hundred calendar days after the declaration of a biosecurity emergency, or by a separate proclamation of the governor, whichever occurs first. (e)  If the governor requisitions and takes control of any property or the temporary use thereof, the owner, or other person entitled thereto, shall be paid a sum, determined by the governor to be fair and just compensation for the property or use, within twenty days after the property has been requisitioned and taken, or in monthly or lesser installments if the property is taken for temporary use.
