HB984 CD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 984 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII S.D. 1 C.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO AGRICULTURAL LOANS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii agricultural producers face critical barriers in accessing capital necessary to cover rising land and water costs, labor shortages, and infrastructure needs.  Modifications to the state agricultural loan program are needed to address these challenges and encourage farmers and ranchers to expand their current operations.  A diverse agricultural sector that includes small and mid-sized farms is essential to Hawaii's food security, economic resilience, and self-sufficiency. Modifications to the state agricultural loan program should ensure equitable access to capital for farmers of all scales, with a focus on enabling sustainable, community-based, and diversified production. The purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Lower and fix the state agricultural loan program's interest rates, increase loan limits, and reduce the required number of credit denials; (2)  Establish a program for a secured line of credit and create a new loan initiative to encourage larger scale agriculture for import replacement and crops grown for farm to state programs; and (3)  Include food hubs as an eligible entity for class E loans. SECTION 2.  Section 155-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding two new definitions to be appropriately inserted and to read as follows: ""Import replacement crops" means crops grown on a large‑scale basis in the State with the specific intent to replace crops imported into the State. "Line of credit" means a secured revolving loan with a preset credit limit." SECTION 3.  Section 155-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§155-3  Restriction.  Loans authorized by this chapter shall require [two credit denials, except for class "F" loans for new farmer and farm innovation programs, which shall require] one credit denial. This requirement shall be waived for new farmer loans for $100,000 or less for farm trainees and recent college graduates with a degree in agriculture.  This requirement may also be waived by the board of agriculture for emergency loans.  Credit denials may be accepted from any of the following: (1)  Private lenders; (2)  Members of the farm credit system; or (3)  The United States Department of Agriculture." SECTION 4.  Section 155-8, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (c) to read as follows: "(c)  Loans made under this section shall bear simple interest on the unpaid principal balance, charged on the actual amount disbursed to the borrower.  The interest rate on loans of class "A", "B", "C", "E", [and] "G", and "J" shall be at a rate of [one per cent below the prime rate or at a rate of seven and one-half] four per cent a year[, whichever is less.  For purposes of this subsection, the prime rate shall be determined on January 1 and July 1 of each year, and shall be the prime rate charged by the two largest banks in the State identified by the department of commerce and consumer affairs.  If the prime rates of the two largest banks are different, the lower prime rate of the two shall apply.  The interest rate of class "F" loans shall be at a rate of one and one-half per cent below the prime rate or at a rate of six per cent a year, whichever is less].  The interest rate of class "D", "F", "H" [and], "I", and "K" loans shall be three per cent a year.  If the money loaned is borrowed by the department, then the interest on loans of the classes shall be the rate as determined above or one per cent over the cost to the State of borrowing the money, whichever is greater.  Interest on loans made under this chapter shall not be less than three per cent a year."
