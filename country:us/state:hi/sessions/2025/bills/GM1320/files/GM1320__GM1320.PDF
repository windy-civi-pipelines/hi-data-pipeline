STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the current special
2 fund ceiling for the mass transit special fund has produced
3 carry-over balances, impacting the use of funds by the
4 department of budget and finance in the subsequent fiscal year.
5 The legislature further finds that in fiscal year
6 2022-2023, there was a carry-over balance of $95,877,228 from
7 fiscal year 2021-2022. The department of budget and finance was
8 unable to disburse the available moneys in fiscal year
9 2022-2023, leading to a carry-over balance in fiscal year
10 2023-2024. Based on the special fund carry-over balance of
11 $123,756,991 from fiscal year 2022-2023, and estimated revenue
12 of $410,240,000 for fiscal year 2023-2024, the department of
13 budget and finance anticipates another shortfall in the special
14 fund ceiling authorized by Act 88, Session Laws of Hawaii 2021,
15 as amended by Act 248, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022. In
16 anticipation of this shortfall, the department of budget and
17 finance received an emergency appropriation of $179,000,000 for

1 the disbursement of funds by Act 23, Session Laws of Hawaii
2 2024 .
3 The legislature further finds that the Waiawa Pearl
4 Highlands station has been identified as critical to expanding
5 access to potential users across Central Oahu and increasing
6 initial ridership. Therefore, the Waiawa Pearl Highlands
7 station is essential to the financial sustainability of the
8 Honolulu rail transit project. As such, the Honolulu authority
9 for rapid transportation proposed the construction of an access
10 ramp at the Waiawa Pearl Highlands station from the H-2 freeway
11 and bus transit center, as detailed in the authority's 2022
12 recovery plan. The amended full funding grant agreement with
13 the Federal Transit Administration, which initiated federal
14 funding for the Honolulu rail transit project in 2017, is based
15 on the recovery plan. The recovery plan clearly states that the
16 Ala Moana transit center and Pearl Highlands parking garage must
17 be provided by non-Federal Transit Administration capital
18 investment grant program funds, affirming the commitment for the
19 Honolulu authority for rapid transportation to complete the
20 project.

H.D. 1
C.D. 1
1 The estimated cost for completion of the rail transit
2 project is approximately $9,000,000,000, with upwards of
3 $1,500,000,000 from the federal government and the remainder
4 from the State's general excise tax and the transient
5 accommodations tax. The request for an increase in the mass
6 transit special fund ceiling is in recognition of the incoming
7 tax revenue collected at an increased rate, allocating the
8 additional available funds to fulfill the obligations as
9 provided in the recovery plan.
10 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to increase the
11 special fund expenditure ceiling for the mass transit special
12 fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2025, and ending June
13 30, 2026, for the developments detailed in the Honolulu
14 authority for rapid transportation 2022 recovery plan.
15 SECTION 2. There is appropriated out of the mass transit
16 special fund the sum of $572,695,000 or so much thereof as may
17 be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 for making disbursements
18 pursuant to section 248-2.7, Hawaii Revised Statutes; provided
19 that:

21 potential partners for the planning, design, and
