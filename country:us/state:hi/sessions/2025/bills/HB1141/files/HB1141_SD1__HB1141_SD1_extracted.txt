Section 1:
HB1141 SD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1141 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII S.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO UPDATING PUBLIC LAND LEASES ISSUED PURSUANT TO CHAPTER 171, HAWAII REVISED STATUTES. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  An audit conducted by the state auditor at the direction of the legislature made critical findings regarding the special land and development fund within the department of land and natural resources.  The auditor's findings and recommendations were contained in Audit Report No. 19-12.  Subsequently, a house investigative committee (committee) was established on April 29, 2021, to review the audit.  The legislature notes that the committee recommended to require, upon approval of a lease extension, an update to the terms and conditions of a lease to reflect the most current lease form.  The legislature finds that the Hawaii Supreme Court's decision in State v. Kahua Ranch, Ltd., 47 Haw. 28, 384 P.2d 581 (1963), prohibited reforming leases in a way that would be inconsistent with the terms of the notice of sale, but that case does not apply to the terms and conditions in an extended lease. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to require lease extensions approved by the board of land and natural resources to be drafted on the most current approved lease form, be subject to the most current leasing practices and policies of the board, and in the event of a conflict or inconsistency between an updated lease term or condition authorized under chapter 171, Hawaii Revised Statutes, and a term or condition of the lease being extended, the updated lease term or condition authorized under chapter 171, Hawaii Revised Statutes, shall control.  This Act is intended to apply to all leases issued under chapter 171, Hawaii Revised Statutes, regardless of whether they were issued by public auction or direct negotiation. SECTION 2. Section 171-36, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§171-36  Lease restrictions; generally.  (a) Except as otherwise provided, the following restrictions shall apply to all leases: (1)  Options for renewal of terms are prohibited; (2)  No lease shall be for a longer term than sixty-five years, except in the case of a residential leasehold, which may provide for an initial term of fifty-five years with the privilege of extension to meet the requirements of the Federal Housing Administration, Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Land Bank of Berkeley, Federal Intermediate Credit Bank of Berkeley, Berkeley Bank for Cooperatives, or Department of Veterans Affairs requirements; provided that the aggregate of the initial term and extension shall in no event exceed seventy-five years; (3)  No lease shall be made for any land under a lease that has more than two years to run; (4)  No lease shall be made to any person who is in arrears in the payment of taxes, rents, or other obligations owed to the State or any county; (5)  No lease shall be transferable or assignable, except by devise, bequest, or intestate succession; provided that with the approval of the board, the assignment and transfer of a lease or unit thereof may be made in accordance with current industry standards, as determined by the board; provided further that [prior to] before the approval of any assignment of lease, the board shall have the right to review and approve the consideration to be paid by the assignee and may condition its consent to the assignment of the lease on payment by the lessee of a premium based on the amount by which the consideration for the assignment, whether by cash, credit, or otherwise, exceeds the depreciated cost of improvements and trade fixtures being transferred to the assignee; provided further that with respect to state agricultural leases, in the event of foreclosure or sale, the premium, if any, shall be assessed only after the encumbrances of record and any other advances made by the holder of a security interest are paid; (6)  The lessee shall not sublet the whole or any part of the demised premises, except with the approval of the board; provided that [prior to] before the approval, the board shall have the right to review and approve the rent to be charged to the sublessee; provided further that in the case where the lessee is required to pay rent based on a percentage of its gross receipts, the receipts of the sublessee shall be included as part of the lessee's gross receipts; provided further that the board shall have the right to review and, if necessary, revise the rent of the demised premises based upon the rental rate charged to the sublessee, including the percentage rent, if applicable, and provided that the rent may not be revised downward; (7)  The lease shall be for a specific use or uses and shall not include waste lands, unless it is impractical to provide otherwise; (8)  Mineral and metallic rights and surface and ground water shall be reserved to the State; and (9)  No lease of public lands, including submerged lands, or any extension of any lease of public lands shall be issued by the State to any person to construct, use, or maintain a sunbathing or swimming pier or to use the lands for those purposes, unless the lease, or any extension thereof, contains provisions permitting the general public to use the pier facilities on the public lands and requiring that a sign or signs be placed on the pier, clearly visible to the public, that indicates the public's right to the use of the pier.  The board, at the earliest practicable date, and where legally possible, shall cause all existing leases to be amended to conform to this paragraph.  [The term "lease", for] For the purposes of this paragraph, "lease" includes month-to-month rental agreements and similar tenancies.

(d) The board, at any time during the term of any intensive agricultural, aquaculture, or mariculture lease and when justified by sound economic practices or other circumstances, may permit an alternative agricultural, aquaculture, or mariculture use or uses for any portion or portions of the land demised.  As a condition to permitting alternative uses, the board may require any other modifications, including rental adjustments or changes in the lease, as may be necessary to effect or accommodate the alternative use or uses.  An alternative use or uses may be allowed by the board upon: (1)  The application of the lessee; (2)  Consent of each holder of record having a security interest in the leasehold; and (3)  A finding by the board that the alternative use or uses are in the public interest.
