Section 1:
HB1478 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1478 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to campaign finance. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that transparency and accountability in the political process are essential to preserving the integrity of democracy and ensuring that voters have access to clear and accurate information about the sources of funding behind election-related advertisements.  However, the proliferation of "dark money" in politics exacerbated by unlimited corporate spending following the Citizens United decision has undermined this foundational promise.  Wealthy special interests, often operating through complex networks of shell organizations, obscure the true sources of their campaign contributions, depriving voters of critical information necessary for informed decision-making. These challenges can be addressed by requiring individuals and organizations acting as conduits for significant political expenditures to disclose the original sources of funds and the identities of the top contributors behind electioneering communications.  It establishes consistent reporting standards for entities involved in independent expenditures and ensures transparency in digital advertisements, recognizing the unique challenges posed by modern technologies. The legislature also finds that while protecting the rights to free speech and political participation, it is essential to curb deceptive practices that exploit loopholes in campaign finance laws.  As modern technology and digital platforms expand the reach and influence of election related communications, ensuring that voters have access to information about the origins of these messages has become increasingly important.  The legislature believes that voters must be able to discern the financial interests and motives behind political messages, thereby promoting fairness and accountability in the electoral process. The purpose of this Act is to require the full disclosure of original sources of large campaign contributions, particularly when funds are funneled through intermediaries, thereby empowering citizens to make informed decisions when evaluating candidates and holding elected officials accountable. SECTION 2.  Chapter 11, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding three new sections to part XIII to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§11-A  Identification of certain top contributors.  (a) Except as otherwise provided by this section, any expenditure for a communication funded by a noncandidate committee subject to section 11345 or created through any in-kind contribution received by a noncandidate committee subject to section 11-345 shall include a notice that includes: (1)  Any information required by section 11-391; (2)  For any communication that has a visual component, a notice that clearly and conspicuously displays the names of the top three donors who directly or indirectly donated $10,000 or more in original funds during the two-year election period to the noncandidate committee.  This written notice shall start with the words, "The three top contributors who helped pay for this message are", followed by the names of the three top contributors as determined under subsection (d); and (3)  For any communication that has an audio component, a notice that clearly and conspicuously states the names of the top three donors who directly or indirectly donated $10,000 or more in original funds during the two-year election period to the noncandidate committee.  This audio notice shall start with the words, "The three top contributors who helped pay for this message are", followed by the names of the three top contributors as determined under subsection (d). (b)  For communications disseminated electronically and for which it is technologically impossible to include all of the information required by this section in a clear and conspicuous manner, the communication shall: (1)  State the name of the person that paid for the communication; and (2)  Include an active link for the recipient of the digital communication to immediately view the remainder of the information required under this section with minimal effort and without receiving or viewing any additional material other than the required information. A communication disseminated by electronic means is not clearly and conspicuously stated or displayed if it is difficult to read or hear or if its placement is easily overlooked. (c) The notice in a communication disseminated electronically is made clearly and conspicuously if the notice meets the following requirements: (1)  In the case of a text or graphic communication, the notice: (A)  Appears in letters at least as large as the majority of the text in the communication; (B)  Is contained in a printed box set apart from the other contents of the communication; and (C)  Is printed with a reasonable degree of color contrast between the background and the printed notice; (2)  In the case of an audio communication, the notice is spoken in a clearly audible and intelligible manner at the beginning or end of the communication and lasts at least four seconds; (3)  In the case of a video communication that also includes audio, the notice: (A)  Is included at either the beginning or the end of the communication; and (B)  Is made both in a written format that meets the requirements of paragraph (1) and appears for at least four seconds, and in an audible format that meets the requirements of paragraph (2); provided that if the video communication is shorter than ten seconds, the audible portion of the notice may be omitted; and (4)  In the case of any other type of communication, the  notice is at least as clear and conspicuous as required for a notice under this subsection. (d)  For the purposes of determining persons that are to be top three contributors as required by subsection (a): (1)  The top three contributors shall be determined by calculating the three contributors of traceable funds that have directly or indirectly contributed to the noncandidate committee the highest amounts of original funds during the two-year election period; (2)  Contributions of traceable funds made in prior two-year election periods shall be considered to have been contributed in the current two-year election period if the contributor's aggregate contributions of original funds to the noncandidate committee constituted the majority of the noncandidate committee's traceable funds at the beginning of the two-year election period; (3)  If multiple contributors have contributed identical amounts to a noncandidate committee so that there is no difference in the amounts contributed by the thirdhighest contributor and fourth-highest or lower-level contributor, the contributor that most recently contributed to the noncandidate committee shall be deemed a top three contributor; (4)  No contributor of traceable funds shall be deemed a top three contributor if the aggregate amount of the contributor's contributions of original funds to the noncandidate committee during the two-year election period is less than $10,000; and (5)  To the extent that fewer than three contributors meet the $10,000 threshold in paragraph (4), an intermediary that directly or indirectly transferred, at least $10,000 in traceable funds to the noncandidate committee during the two-year election period shall be treated as the original source of funds for the purposes of the notice required by this section. §11-B  Structured transactions; prohibited.  No person shall structure or assist in structuring, or attempt to structure or assist in structuring, any solicitation, contribution, expenditure, disbursement, or other transaction to evade the requirements of this chapter. §11-C  Penalties.  In addition to any other penalties, any person who violates this subpart or any rule adopted by the commission pursuant to this subpart shall pay an administrative fine in an amount no less than the amount contributed or spent in violation of this subpart or the reporting requirements, or more than twice the amount contributed or spent in violation of this subpart or the reporting requirements; provided that if the amount contributed or spent in violation of this subpart or the reporting requirements was less than $5,000, the maximum fine shall be $10,000."

BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that transparency and accountability in the political process are essential to preserving the integrity of democracy and ensuring that voters have access to clear and accurate information about the sources of funding behind election-related advertisements.  However, the proliferation of "dark money" in politics exacerbated by unlimited corporate spending following the Citizens United decision has undermined this foundational promise.  Wealthy special interests, often operating through complex networks of shell organizations, obscure the true sources of their campaign contributions, depriving voters of critical information necessary for informed decision-making. These challenges can be addressed by requiring individuals and organizations acting as conduits for significant political expenditures to disclose the original sources of funds and the identities of the top contributors behind electioneering communications.  It establishes consistent reporting standards for entities involved in independent expenditures and ensures transparency in digital advertisements, recognizing the unique challenges posed by modern technologies. The legislature also finds that while protecting the rights to free speech and political participation, it is essential to curb deceptive practices that exploit loopholes in campaign finance laws.  As modern technology and digital platforms expand the reach and influence of election related communications, ensuring that voters have access to information about the origins of these messages has become increasingly important.  The legislature believes that voters must be able to discern the financial interests and motives behind political messages, thereby promoting fairness and accountability in the electoral process. The purpose of this Act is to require the full disclosure of original sources of large campaign contributions, particularly when funds are funneled through intermediaries, thereby empowering citizens to make informed decisions when evaluating candidates and holding elected officials accountable. SECTION 2.  Chapter 11, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding three new sections to part XIII to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§11-A  Identification of certain top contributors.  (a) Except as otherwise provided by this section, any expenditure for a communication funded by a noncandidate committee subject to section 11345 or created through any in-kind contribution received by a noncandidate committee subject to section 11-345 shall include a notice that includes: (1)  Any information required by section 11-391; (2)  For any communication that has a visual component, a notice that clearly and conspicuously displays the names of the top three donors who directly or indirectly donated $10,000 or more in original funds during the two-year election period to the noncandidate committee.  This written notice shall start with the words, "The three top contributors who helped pay for this message are", followed by the names of the three top contributors as determined under subsection (d); and (3)  For any communication that has an audio component, a notice that clearly and conspicuously states the names of the top three donors who directly or indirectly donated $10,000 or more in original funds during the two-year election period to the noncandidate committee.  This audio notice shall start with the words, "The three top contributors who helped pay for this message are", followed by the names of the three top contributors as determined under subsection (d). (b)  For communications disseminated electronically and for which it is technologically impossible to include all of the information required by this section in a clear and conspicuous manner, the communication shall: (1)  State the name of the person that paid for the communication; and (2)  Include an active link for the recipient of the digital communication to immediately view the remainder of the information required under this section with minimal effort and without receiving or viewing any additional material other than the required information.
