STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FORAN ACT
RELATING TO CIGARETTE TAXES.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that since the inception
2 of the cigarette tax in the State, cigarette tax revenue has
3 funded vital health care services in Hawaii, including cancer
4 research and prevention, the State's trauma system, community
5 health centers, and emergency medical services. Before 2006,
6 all cigarette tax revenue was directed to the State's general
7 fund, indirectly supporting health initiatives. However, with
8 the passage of Act 316, Session Laws of Hawaii 2006, which
9 included an increase in the cigarette tax, the legislature
10 formally recognized the importance of allocating increased
11 amounts of cigarette tax revenues to programs that strive to
12 maintain public health in the State, such as the cancer research
13 center of Hawaii, the State's emergency medical services,
14 critically needed trauma centers, and community health centers.
15 The legislature believes these programs are the most appropriate
16 and effective use of cigarette tax revenues to help the greatest
17 number of people in the State.

1 The legislature further finds that financial support for
2 research into the causes and treatment of cancer is especially
3 critical now that cancer diagnoses in the United States for 2024
4 surpassed two million for the first time in history. In the
5 State, an average of 7,393 local residents are diagnosed with
6 invasive cancer, leading to 2,393 deaths each year. Nearly
7 forty per cent of today's adult population will experience
8 cancer in their lifetimes. The cancer research center of
9 Hawaii, also known as the university of Hawaii cancer center, is
10 one of only seventy-two National Cancer Institute (NCI)-
11 designated cancer centers in the United States. A NCI
12 designation is a mark of excellence, requiring the cancer
13 research center of Hawaii to meet rigorous standards for
14 transdisciplinary, state-of-the-art research focused on
15 developing new and better approaches to preventing, diagnosing,
16 and treating cancer. Furthermore, the cancer research center of
17 Hawaii is also the only NCI-designated cancer center serving
18 Hawaii and the Pacific. It is the only cancer center studying
19 cancer causes and treatments in the diverse ethnic groups found
20 in Hawaii and the Pacific, such as Native Hawaiians and Pacific
21 Islanders.

C.D. 1
1 The legislature additionally finds that a portion of the
2 cigarette tax revenue currently allocated to the Hawaii cancer
3 research special fund is specifically pledged towards revenue
4 bonds sold to construct the cancer center in 2010, conduct
5 cancer research, and fund its operations. Due to successful
6 public education, strong anti-smoking policies, and increased
7 costs to cigarettes, the decline in smoking rates is a public
8 health victory. However, paradoxically, this decline in smoking
9 has resulted in a decrease of over fifty per cent in cigarette
10 tax revenues to the Hawaii cancer research special fund. This
11 decline jeopardizes the revenue stream for debt service for the
12 revenue bonds and diminishes the availability of resources for
13 the cancer research center of Hawaii to deliver cutting-edge
14 cancer treatments to the State’s cancer patients.
15 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to ensure the
16 payment for debt service for the revenue bonds and the continued
17 availability of resources for the cancer research center of
18 Hawaii's research and operations by:
19 (1) Increasing the cigarette tax from sixteen cents to
20 eighteen cents; and

2 allocating the increase in the cigarette tax amount to
3 the Hawaii cancer research special fund.
4 SECTION 2. Section 245-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
5 amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:
6 "(a ) Every wholesaler or dealer, in addition to any other
7 taxes provided by law, shall pay, for the privilege of
8 conducting business and other activities in the State, an excise
9 tax equal to:
10 (1) 5.00 cents for each cigarette sold, used, or possessed
11 by a wholesaler or dealer after June 30, 1998, whether

STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FORAN ACT
RELATING TO CIGARETTE TAXES.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that since the inception
2 of the cigarette tax in the State, cigarette tax revenue has
3 funded vital health care services in Hawaii, including cancer
4 research and prevention, the State's trauma system, community
5 health centers, and emergency medical services. Before 2006,
6 all cigarette tax revenue was directed to the State's general
7 fund, indirectly supporting health initiatives. However, with
8 the passage of Act 316, Session Laws of Hawaii 2006, which
9 included an increase in the cigarette tax, the legislature
10 formally recognized the importance of allocating increased
11 amounts of cigarette tax revenues to programs that strive to
12 maintain public health in the State, such as the cancer research
13 center of Hawaii, the State's emergency medical services,
14 critically needed trauma centers, and community health centers.
15 The legislature believes these programs are the most appropriate
16 and effective use of cigarette tax revenues to help the greatest
17 number of people in the State.

1 The legislature further finds that financial support for
2 research into the causes and treatment of cancer is especially
3 critical now that cancer diagnoses in the United States for 2024
4 surpassed two million for the first time in history. In the
5 State, an average of 7,393 local residents are diagnosed with
6 invasive cancer, leading to 2,393 deaths each year. Nearly
7 forty per cent of today's adult population will experience
8 cancer in their lifetimes. The cancer research center of
9 Hawaii, also known as the university of Hawaii cancer center, is
10 one of only seventy-two National Cancer Institute (NCI)-
11 designated cancer centers in the United States. A NCI
12 designation is a mark of excellence, requiring the cancer
13 research center of Hawaii to meet rigorous standards for
14 transdisciplinary, state-of-the-art research focused on
15 developing new and better approaches to preventing, diagnosing,
16 and treating cancer. Furthermore, the cancer research center of
17 Hawaii is also the only NCI-designated cancer center serving
18 Hawaii and the Pacific. It is the only cancer center studying
19 cancer causes and treatments in the diverse ethnic groups found
20 in Hawaii and the Pacific, such as Native Hawaiians and Pacific
21 Islanders.

C.D. 1
1 The legislature additionally finds that a portion of the
2 cigarette tax revenue currently allocated to the Hawaii cancer
3 research special fund is specifically pledged towards revenue
4 bonds sold to construct the cancer center in 2010, conduct
5 cancer research, and fund its operations. Due to successful
6 public education, strong anti-smoking policies, and increased
7 costs to cigarettes, the decline in smoking rates is a public
8 health victory. However, paradoxically, this decline in smoking
9 has resulted in a decrease of over fifty per cent in cigarette
10 tax revenues to the Hawaii cancer research special fund. This
11 decline jeopardizes the revenue stream for debt service for the
12 revenue bonds and diminishes the availability of resources for
13 the cancer research center of Hawaii to deliver cutting-edge
14 cancer treatments to the State’s cancer patients.
15 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to ensure the
16 payment for debt service for the revenue bonds and the continued
17 availability of resources for the cancer research center of
18 Hawaii's research and operations by:
19 (1) Increasing the cigarette tax from sixteen cents to
20 eighteen cents; and

1 (2) Amending the disposition of cigarette tax revenues by
2 allocating the increase in the cigarette tax amount to
3 the Hawaii cancer research special fund.
4 SECTION 2. Section 245-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
5 amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:
6 "(a ) Every wholesaler or dealer, in addition to any other
7 taxes provided by law, shall pay, for the privilege of
8 conducting business and other activities in the State, an excise
9 tax equal to:
10 (1) 5.00 cents for each cigarette sold, used, or possessed
11 by a wholesaler or dealer after June 30, 1998, whether
12 or not sold at wholesale, or if not sold, then at the
