Section 1:
HB214 SD2 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 214 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII S.D. 2 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO GOVERNMENT. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that existing law specifies the circumstances under which an employees' retirement system retirant may be reemployed without the suspension of the retirant's benefits and provides remedies for the employees' retirement system if a retirant is reemployed in violation of chapter 88, Hawaii Revised Statutes, and any administrative rule adopted thereunder.
