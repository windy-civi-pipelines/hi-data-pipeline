HB910 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 910 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to rare diseases. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  A rare disease, sometimes called an orphan disease, is defined as a disease that affects fewer than two hundred thousand people in the United States. There are more than ten thousand known rare diseases affecting approximately thirty million Americans, more than half of which are children.  Eight out of ten rare diseases have a genetic cause.  In a 2019 paper, researchers found that seventy-two per cent of rare diseases analyzed had a genetic origin and can also be classified as genetic disorders.  People with rare diseases face many obstacles, including delays in obtaining an accurate diagnosis, finding a health care provider with expertise in their condition, and a lack of affordable access to therapies and medication used to treat rare diseases which may result in significant physical, mental, and financial challenges. Furthermore, the legislature finds that velocardiofacial syndrome (also known as 22q11 deletion syndrome or DiGeorge syndrome) is a rare genetic disorder which affects feeding, speech, and learning.  Its characteristic features include a cleft palate, heart defects, and distinct facial appearances.  Velocardiofacial syndrome is the most common syndrome associated with a cleft palate.  This syndrome affects the body by targeting immune, endocrine, and neurological systems. It is estimated that one in two thousand to five thousand children per year are born with this condition.  Children who suffer from this syndrome need a multidisciplinary approach to solve their medical problems. The legislature finds a state-based advisory council composed of qualified professionals and persons living with rare diseases and their caregivers could educate or advise medical professionals, government agencies, legislators, and the public about rare diseases as an important public health issue, and encourage research or support the development of new and better policies to diagnose and treat rare diseases. Twenty-nine states have established a Rare Disease Advisory Council (RDAC).  RDACs address the needs of rare patients and families by giving stakeholders an opportunity to make recommendations to state leaders on critical issues including the need for increased awareness, diagnostic tools and access to affordable treatments and cures. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Establish a Rare Disease Advisory Council to increase awareness and effective medical intervention for rare diseases; (2)  Establish the rare disease advisory council special fund; (3)  Require the department of health and the department of education to incorporate the importance of annual physical examinations for children in programs and literature; and (4)  Amend the insurance code to include coverage for individuals who are affected with velocardiofacial syndrome to provide better overall health outcomes. SECTION 2.  Chapter 321, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part .  Rare disease advisory council §321-A Rare disease advisory council; established.  (a)  There is established within the department of health, a rare disease advisory council to provide guidance and recommendations to educate the public, the legislature and other government agencies and departments, as appropriate, on the needs of individuals with rare diseases living in Hawaii. §321-B Duties.  (a) The rare disease advisory council shall conduct the following activities to benefit those impacted by rare diseases in Hawaii: (1)  Convene public hearings, make inquiries, and solicit comments from the general public in Hawaii to assist the council with a first-year landscape or survey of the needs of rare disease patients, caregivers, and providers in the state.
