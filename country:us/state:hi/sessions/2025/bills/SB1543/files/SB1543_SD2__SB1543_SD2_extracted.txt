Section 1:
SB1543 SD2 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1543 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that there is a pressing need to reduce the reliance on external consultants for work that can or should be performed by qualified government employees.  Excessive outsourcing of government functions often leads to increased costs, diminished accountability, and a loss of institutional knowledge within public agencies. By prioritizing the use of in-house expertise, the State can foster greater transparency in its operations, ensuring that decisions about the allocation of public funds are clear, justifiable, and aligned with the best interests of taxpayers.  Moreover, reducing dependence on external consultants will promote cost efficiency, enabling government agencies to allocate resources more effectively while building and retaining institutional capacity. Strengthening the role of public employees in performing core government functions will also enhance the long‑term sustainability and independence of state operations.  Through these efforts, the legislature seeks to ensure that public agencies are equipped to meet the evolving needs of the State in a manner that is both responsible and effective. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to reduce reliance on external consultants for work that can be performed by qualified government employees and ensure transparency, cost efficiency, and the development of in-house expertise within government agencies by: (1)  Requiring each purchasing agency to provide justification for hiring external consultants; (2)  Capping the amount each agency can spend on external consultants; (3)  Requiring each agency to seek approval from the legislature for consulting contracts exceeding a certain dollar amount; (4)  Requiring each agency to disclose all contracts with external consultants; (5)  Requiring annual reports to the legislature; (6)  Requiring the compliance audit unit to conduct regular audits of agency consultant contracts to assess cost‑effectiveness and compliance; and (7)  Requiring each chief procurement officer to ensure that inherent government functions are not delegated to a contractor. SECTION 2.  Chapter 103D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part III to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§103D-     External consultants; justification; spending caps; reporting requirements; audits.  (a) Notwithstanding section 103D‑301, each purchasing agency shall: (1)  Provide detailed justification for hiring external consultants by: (A)  Demonstrating the lack of in-house capacity or expertise; (B)  Conducting a cost-benefit analysis that compares consultant costs with the expenses of hiring or training state employees; and (C)  Publishing justification reports for public and legislative review; (2)  Spend no more than per cent of the purchasing agency's budget on consulting services; (3)  Seek approval from the legislature for any contract for consulting services exceeding $          ; (4)  Disclose all contracts the purchasing agency awards to external consultants after the effective date of this Act, including: (A)  The total costs of each contract, broken down by service and duration; (B)  The names of consultants and firms; and (C)  The work scope and deliverables; and (5)  Submit an annual report to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular session on its contracts with external consultants, which shall include: (A)  The number of external consultants used; and (B)  The percentage of the purchasing agency's budget spent on consulting.

(c)  This section shall not apply to the contracting of external consultants for: (1)  Highly technical or niche expertise unavailable in the State; and (2)  Short-term emergency needs, including disaster response or urgent technical projects."
