HB1264 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1264 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to waste management. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that as the State strives to fulfill its commitments to reduce waste and effectively mitigate the impacts of climate change, extended producer responsibility policies offer an opportunity to create mutually beneficial partnerships with the businesses that produce packaging waste. Extended producer responsibility policies are designed to transfer some portion of the costs of managing the waste generated by the sale of consumer goods to the entities that produce those goods.  These policies stand in contrast to existing policies that place this responsibility solely on taxpayers.  The failure of recycling programs and the multiple crises created by plastic pollution, which fouls air, water, and biological systems worldwide, are the primary drivers leading to the call for such innovative solutions. The legislature further finds that Hawaii has a unique role to play in creating extended producer responsibility solutions due to the State's relatively small resident population, remote location bounded by the Pacific ocean, and global image as a relatively pristine environment. The fact that the islands attract millions of visitors each year adds to Hawaii's value as a proving ground for forward-thinking waste reduction initiatives. The legislature also finds that the corporations that produce the greatest volume of consumer goods have a correspondingly unique role to play in solving the problems caused by the proliferation of packaging waste.  Among these corporations, sixteen of the top twenty are signatories to the Global Commitment for a New Plastics Economy, an initiative developed by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the United Nations Environmental Programme as a primary means for implementing waste-related sustainable development goals.  These existing commitments have signatories who are on track to reduce the volume of plastic packaging waste that their business models generate and ensure that whatever remains is either reusable, recyclable, or compostable. Finally, the legislature finds that although reuse strategies offer far greater benefits than recycling programs, these strategies have historically failed to gain the resources needed to develop and ensure success. The purpose of this Act is to establish an extended producer responsibility program to engage producers to eliminate packaging waste in the State. PART II SECTION 2.  The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Chapter Extended producer responsibility program §   -1  Definitions.  As used in this chapter: "Baseline volume" means the volume of packaging waste a county sends to a power plant that burns municipal solid waste as a fuel, a landfill, or both, during the calendar year beginning and ending on a date determined by rule.

"Program year" means a full calendar year beginning and ending on a date determined by rule; provided that the final program year shall be determined by rule. "Reuse" means to extend the life of a product, package, or resource, excluding materials used as a fuel substitute or for energy production (i.e. incineration), by either using it more than once with little to no processing (same or new function), repairing it so it can be used longer, or sharing, renting, selling, or donating it to another party. §   -2.  Sales prohibition.  Beginning and ending on a date determined by rules adopted by the department, no covered producer shall sell or offer for sale any fast-moving consumer good for delivery in this State unless the covered producer has registered pursuant to section    -3 and complied with any other applicable provisions of this chapter. §   -3.  Fast-moving consumer good; covered producer responsibility.  (a) Beginning on July 1, 2027, each covered producer shall register with the department and pay to the department a fee as provided in subsection (e).
