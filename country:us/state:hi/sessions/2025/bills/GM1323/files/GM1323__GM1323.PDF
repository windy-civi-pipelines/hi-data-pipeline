C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO DEPARTMENTAL DATA SHARING.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the statewide
2 longitudinal data system stores and analyzes career and
3 technical education data it receives from all state educational
4 systems and workforce training agencies to support research and
5 evaluation that will improve outcomes throughout the early
6 education to workforce pipeline. While other state agencies are
7 included in the system to provide data as appropriate, the
8 determination of whether or not data from another department is
9 appropriate is left to the department of education, the
10 executive office on early learning, the university of Hawaii,
11 the department of labor and industrial relations, and the
12 department of human services.
13 The legislature further finds that data currently collected
14 by state educational systems and workforce training agencies
15 does not include information from certain segments of Hawaii's
16 workforce, such as those who are self-employed. This leaves the
17 current workforce data incomplete. Gathering data from the tax
