STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO KUPUNA HOUSING.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the State's kupuna
2 are at significant risk of homelessness. As rental prices have
3 experienced dramatic increases statewide, more kupuna, who are
4 on fixed incomes, struggle to secure affordable housing.
5 Presently, the state rent supplement program for kupuna provides
6 support for qualified kupuna who are homeless or at imminent
7 risk of being homeless. However, this critical program will
8 sunset in 2026, creating uncertainty for existing participants
9 in the program. Therefore, extending the sunset date will
10 ensure continued access to critical rent supplement assistance.
11 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to extend the
12 sunset date of the state rent supplement program for kupuna to
13 continue to accommodate the housing needs of qualified
14 participants.
15 SECTION 2. Act 98, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023, is amended
16 by amending section 6 to read as follows:
2025-3260 HB703 CDl HMSO
