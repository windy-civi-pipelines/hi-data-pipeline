Section 1:
SB847 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 847 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO PSYCHOLOGISTS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that there is limited access to mental health care treatment services for residents across the State.  The delivery of comprehensive, accessible, and affordable mental health care has been demonstrably enhanced by collaborative practice among licensed clinical psychologists with prescriptive authority and medical doctors in federal facilities and programs and in states that have authorized prescriptive authority for psychologists.  The legislature finds that providing limited prescriptive authority to qualified, licensed clinical psychologists, subject to supervision by a licensed medical doctor, could help make comprehensive mental health care more accessible to medically underserved residents of the State.  The legislature acknowledges that the Health Resources and Services Administration of the United States Department of Health and Human Services has officially designated much of the State, including isolated rural locations and urban areas with high population densities, as a mental health professional shortage area.  This designation highlights the critical need for expansion of available mental health services and development of a corps of mental health professionals to serve the currently unmet needs of Hawaiʻi's population. The legislature has previously authorized prescription privileges for advanced practice registered nurses, optometrists, dentists, podiatrists, and physician assistants.  These practitioners have been granted prescriptive authority based on demonstration of specific training, education, and practical competency. Education and training criteria, such as passage of national board examinations and degree and minimum experience requirements, have worked well to assure quality of services. Limitations on authority including the use of approved formularies, limited practice areas, and prohibitions on accepting or distributing drug samples have served to deter abuses in the system and to prevent the inappropriate practice of general medicine. Prescriptive authority for non-physician practitioners with varying types of limitations and supervision requirements has proven manageable and has expanded access to important health care services for patients across the State. Clinical psychologists with appropriate training have been allowed to prescribe medications to active duty military personnel and their families in federal facilities and the federal Indian health service program for years.  In recent years, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, New Mexico, and Utah have adopted legislation authorizing prescriptive authority for appropriately trained psychologists without regard to the service setting. Since 2000, psychologists in Hawaiʻi have received psychopharmacological training through the Tripler Army Medical Center psychology training program.  These psychologists have actively collaborated with primary care physicians to provide combined therapy and psychopharmacological care to medically underserved patient populations at eleven federally qualified health centers: Bay Clinic, Hana, Molokaʻi, Kauaʻi, Waiʻanae, Kalihi-Palama, Waimānalo, Koʻolauloa, West Hawaiʻi, Kōkua Kalihi Valley, and Waikiki, as well as a native Hawaiian health care system clinic located in a federally designated medically underserved area on Molokaʻi. The American Psychological Association has developed a model curriculum for a master's degree in psychopharmacology for the education and training of prescribing psychologists.  Independent evaluations of the United States Department of Defense psychopharmacological demonstration project by the United States General Accounting Office, now known as the Government Accountability Office, and the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology, as well as the experiences of Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, and New Mexico, have demonstrated that appropriately trained clinical psychologists can prescribe psychotropic medications safely and effectively. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to allow qualified psychologists to prescribe psychotropic medications for the treatment of mental illness to patients under the psychologist's care in certain circumstances. SECTION 2. Chapter 465, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part     . PRESCRIPTION CERTIFICATION §465-    Definitions.
