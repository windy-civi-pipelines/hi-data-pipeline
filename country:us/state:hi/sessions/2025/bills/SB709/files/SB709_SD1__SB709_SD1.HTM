(b)  The department shall publish a report on the department's website on the data collected pursuant to subsection (a).  The reports shall be updated at least monthly and shall include the number of: (1)  Crisis reports, disaggregated by county, made to a department hotline, crisis line, or other means for the public to contact the department, including through department-contracted service providers, and the disposition of the reports; (2)  Persons transported for emergency examination pursuant to section 334-59, disaggregated by type of transport, length of time in the emergency room, disposition of the matter, and the county in which the facility where the person was transported is located; (3)  Assisted community treatment examinations performed prior to discharge pursuant to section 334-121.5, and the disposition of the evaluations; (4)  Assisted community treatment petitions filed pursuant to section 334-123, category of the petitioner, whether the attorney general assisted with the petition, disposition of the petition, length of time to disposition, and number of persons currently under an assisted community treatment order; (5)  Court orders for treatment over the patient's objection sought pursuant to section 334-161, disposition of the orders sought, and number of patients currently under a court order for treatment; (6)  Administrative authorizations for treatment over the patient's objection sought pursuant to section 334‑162, disposition of the authorization sought, and number of patients currently under an administrative authorization for treatment; and (7)  Involuntary hospitalization petitions filed pursuant to section 334-60.3, disposition of the petitions, length of time to disposition, and number of patients currently under an involuntary hospitalization petition.

(b)  While assisting a person pursuant to subsection (a), the department staff or responder from another department or private service provider coordinating with the department shall assess whether the person meets the criteria for assisted community treatment pursuant to section 334-121.  If, upon assessment, the department reasonably believes that the person meets the criteria for assisted community treatment, the department shall coordinate: (1)  Completion of an examination pursuant to section 334‑121.5; (2)  Preparation of a certificate as specified by subsection 334‑123(c); and (3)  Filing, with assistance from the department of the attorney general, a petition for an assisted community treatment order pursuant to section 334-123; provided that the certificate and petition shall not be required if an assisted community treatment order is not indicated by the examination; provided further that the examination, certificate preparation, and filing of the petition may be completed by the department or by another department or private service provider coordinating with the department pursuant to subsection (a), in which case the department shall not be required to be the petitioner.
