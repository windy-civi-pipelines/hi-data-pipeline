Section 1:
HB332 HD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 332 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO RECYCLING. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the improper disposal of batteries and battery-embedded products creates significant safety and environmental dangers.  For example, in 2016, a four-alarm fire at a material recovery facility in San Mateo County, California, caused millions of dollars in damage.  The fire was likely caused by a rechargeable battery. In particular, lithium-ion batteries pose significant fire risks, with well-publicized incidents having occurred in homes and airliners.  Despite laws regulating the disposal of lithium‑ion batteries, many are improperly discarded and end up in landfills or other inappropriate parts of the solid waste system.  The improper disposal of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries in the State's landfills creates unnecessary safety hazards for workers and surrounding residents, while also posing environmental threats to the State's land and water resources, including aquifers. The legislature further finds that the lack of accessible recycling options causes many batteries to be improperly disposed of in landfills.  The legislature also finds that requiring lithium-ion battery producers to play a more active role in the recovery and recycling of their products will help to ensure that lithium-ion batteries stay out of the State's landfills. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish a lithium-ion battery recycling working group within the department of health to assess recycling methods for small and medium format lithium-ion batteries. SECTION 2. (a)  There is established within the department of health the lithium-ion battery recycling working group to assess: (1)  The sources of lithium-ion batteries; (2)  The estimated quantity of lithium-ion batteries in the State; (3)  The threats that improper disposal poses to human and environmental health; and (4)  Recycling methods for small and medium format lithium-ion batteries. (b) The working group shall consist of: (1)  The director of health, or the director's designee, who shall serve as chair; and (2)  The chief energy officer, or the chief energy officer's designee. (c)  The chair of the working group shall invite the following individuals to serve as members of the working group: (1)  One representative from the lithium-ion battery manufacturing industry; (2)  One representative from the in-state lithium-ion battery recycling or collection industry; (3)  One representative from the waste shipping industry; (4)  One representative from an out-of-state lithium-ion battery recycling company; (5)  One representative from an organization that specializes in extended producer responsibility; (6)  One representative from a county fire department; and (7)  Any other members as invited by the chair. (d)  The working group shall submit a report of its findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of     . (e)  The working group shall be dissolved on . SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 3000. Report Title: Lithium-ion Batteries; Recycling; DOH; Working Group Description: Establishes a lithium-ion battery recycling working group within the Department of Health to assess recycling methods for small and medium format lithium-ion batteries.  Effective 7/1/3000.  (HD1) The summary description of legislation appearing on this page is for informational purposes only and is not legislation or evidence of legislative intent.
