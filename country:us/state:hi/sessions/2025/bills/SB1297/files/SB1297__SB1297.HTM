Section 1:
SB1297 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1297 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO VEGETATIVE BURNING. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that there is a connection between the protection of the environment and public health.  The most significant health threat of commercial burning results from the inhalation of fine particulates produced when wood and other organic materials burn.  According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, exposure to fine particulate air pollution has been linked with respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, including but not limited to asthma, chronic bronchitis, irregular heartbeat, heart attacks, and the risk of death for individuals suffering from heart disease or lung disease.  Studies have shown racial and ethnic minorities have been found to be exposed at higher rates to air pollution based on factors such as socioeconomic status, area of residence, occupation, and neighborhood segregation. The legislature further finds that preventative measures against air pollution may save lives.  Federal legislation, such as the Clean Air Act, aid in the reduction of air pollution. A 2020 study found that poor air quality and air pollution derived from human activities lead to over one hundred thousand deaths in the United States during a single year.  Decreasing the concentration of fine air particulate pollution lowers the risk of all-cause mortality. The purpose of this Act is to prohibit the issuance of permits for commercial vegetative burning in residential neighborhoods or within the vicinity of residential areas. SECTION 2. Chapter 342B, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§342B-    Vegetative burning in residential areas.  The department shall not issue permits for the commercial burning of green waste products within residential areas or areas within one thousand feet of a residential property. This prohibition shall not apply to the permitted roasting of coffee." SECTION 3. New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 4. This Act shall take effect upon its approval. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: DOH; Air Pollution; Vegetative Burning; Green Waste; Permits; Residential Areas Description: Prohibits the Department of Health from issuing permits for commercial burning of green waste products in residential areas or within one thousand feet of a residential property. The summary description of legislation appearing on this page is for informational purposes only and is not legislation or evidence of legislative intent.
