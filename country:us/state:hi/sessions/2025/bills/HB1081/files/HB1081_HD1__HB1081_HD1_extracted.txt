HB1081 HD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1081 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE OFFICE OF WELLNESS AND RESILIENCE. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the office of wellness and resilience leads efforts to make Hawaii a trauma-informed state. Trauma-informed care is defined as an approach to understanding, recognizing, respecting, and responding to the pervasive and widespread impacts of trauma on a person's ability to connect with themselves and others, the person's place and the elements around them, and the person's ways of being. The legislature further finds that strengthening policies and programs to be trauma-informed can result in better workforce retention and recruitment. The legislature also finds that the office of wellness and resilience is best suited to be a semi-autonomous authority under the department of human resources development because of its unique oversight of, and collaboration with, other executive state departments. The department of human resources development has oversight over all other state departments on topics of focus for the office of wellness and resilience and a trauma-informed state, including workplace environment and well-being, training and professional development, benefits, and recruitment and retention. The purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Transfer the office of wellness and resilience to the department of human resources development for administrative purposes only; (2)  Establish a wellness and resilience advisory board within the department of human resources development; and (3)  Update the office of wellness and resilience's functions. SECTION 2.  Chapter 27, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding to part IX a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§27-     Wellness and resilience advisory board; establishment; members; roles.  (a)  There is established within the department, for administrative purposes only, a wellness and resilience advisory board to advise the office in implementing this part. The board shall consist of eleven members, with quorum being six members.  The eleven members shall be: (1)  The director of health, or the director's designee, who shall serve as the chairperson of the advisory board; (2)  The director of human services, or the director's designee; (3)  The superintendent of education, or the superintendent's designee; (4)  The director of corrections and rehabilitation, or the director's designee; (5)  The director of the executive office on early learning, or the director's designee; (6)  A member of the judiciary, to be appointed by the chief justice of the supreme court; (7)  A faculty member from the university of Hawaii John A. Burns school of medicine, to be appointed by the dean of the university of Hawaii John A. Burns school of medicine; and (8)  The following four members appointed by the chairperson for a term of four years: (A)  The chief executive officer of Kamehameha Schools, or the chief executive officer's designee; (B)  A member of the law enforcement community; (C)  A member of the nonprofit sector; and (D)  A community member or nonprofit representative          from the Compact of Free Association islander community. (b) The wellness and resilience advisory board shall advise on wellness and resilience through trauma-informed care in the State.  Specifically, the advisory board shall: (1)  Create, develop, and adopt a statewide framework for trauma-informed and responsive practice.  The framework shall include: (A)  A clear definition of "trauma-informed and responsive practice"; (B)  Principles of trauma-informed and responsive care that may apply to any school, health care provider, law enforcement agency, community organization, state agency, or other entity that has contact with children or youth; (C)  Clear examples of how individuals and institutions may implement trauma-informed and responsive practices across different domains, including organizational leadership, workforce development, policy and decision-making, and evaluation; (D)  Strategies for preventing and addressing secondary traumatic stress for all professionals and providers working with children and youth and their families who have experienced trauma; (E)  Recommendations to implement trauma-informed care professional development and strategy requirements in state and county contracts; and (F)  An implementation and sustainability plan, consisting of an evaluation plan with suggested metrics for assessing ongoing progress of the framework; (2)  Identify best practices, including those from Native Hawaiian cultural practices, with respect to children and youth who have experienced or are at risk of experiencing trauma, and their families; (3)  Provide a trauma-informed care inventory and assessment of public and private agencies and departments; (4)  Identify various cultural practices that build wellness and resilience in communities; (5)  Convene trauma-informed care practitioners so that they may share research and strategies in helping communities build wellness and resilience; (6)  Seek ways in which federal funding may be used to better coordinate and improve the response to families impacted by coronavirus disease 2019, substance use disorders, domestic violence, poverty, and other forms of trauma; and make recommendations, as necessary, for a government position to communicate with federal agencies to seek and leverage federal funding with state and county agencies and philanthropic organizations; and (7)  Coordinate data collection and funding streams to support the efforts of the board. (c) The nongovernmental members of the wellness and resilience advisory board shall serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for expenses, including travel expenses, necessary for the performance of their duties." SECTION 3. Section 27-61, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended as follows: 1.  By adding a new definition to be appropriately inserted and to read: ""Department" means the department of human resources development." 2.  By repealing the definition of "trauma-informed care task force".
