BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  Huli Au Ola, Maui county area health education center, provides support and assistance to underserved and rural areas of Maui county. The island of Molokai is the area most underserved by non-primary care physicians and dentists.  The retention of physicians and dentists is critical to the Molokai community of approximately seven thousand residents.
