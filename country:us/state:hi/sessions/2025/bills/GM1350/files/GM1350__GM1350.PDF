THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII S.D. 2
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO FIREWORKS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the widespread use
2 of illegal fireworks poses an extreme danger and lethal risk to
3 public health and safety, resulting in fires, serious burn
4 injuries, and fatalities to innocent bystanders. The cost to
5 the community far outweighs any intrinsic benefit, as numerous
6 lives have been lost over the years from the use of illegal
7 fireworks. In addition, the potential for wildfires in this
8 time of climate change is a real and present danger and is a top
9 priority for all levels of government today.
10 The legislature further finds that fireworks-related
11 tragedies, including the Aliamanu New Year's Eve explosion of
12 2024 that claimed at least six lives, seriously impact entire
13 neighborhoods in urban Honolulu and across the State. Fireworks
14 also emit excessive smoke and other toxins into the air, making
15 breathing difficult for thousands of Hawaii residents with
16 respiratory ailments. Noise from loud fireworks traumatizes
17 many residents, particularly war veterans who may suffer from

1 post-traumatic stress from being in combat. Pets and vulnerable
2 species in their natural habitats also suffer each holiday
3 season when fireworks noise and environmental pollution levels
4 are especially high.
5 The legislature recognizes that, with the increase in
6 fireworks-related calls, public safety agencies are heavily
7 strained to maintain adequate response levels for other critical
8 emergencies, which adds to the cost of state and county
9 resources that could be used for natural disasters and other
10 emergencies. These agencies are often overwhelmed and are not
11 able to stop the thousands of illegal fireworks being used,
12 making it a death trap for thousands of innocent lives who are
13 not involved in illegal fireworks use.
14 The legislature also finds that the State's communities
15 deserve to live in peace and security without the public safety
16 risk and disruptive impact of illegal fireworks. There can be
17 no more gray areas when lives are lost while this black market
18 flourishes.
19 The legislature believes that intelligence-led policing and
20 criminal surveillance of illegal fireworks can be effective
21 approaches in deterring the use of illegal fireworks. An
