SB530 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 530 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to braille literacy. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that literacy skills are fundamental to success in education, employment, and life for all members of society, including individuals with low vision and blindness.  Braille is a tactile writing system that allows low vision and blind individuals to read by touch using a system of raised dots that represent letters, numbers, and symbols.  Braille literacy skills are widely understood as essential for low vision and blind students to actively learn, seek and maintain remunerative employment, engage in cultural enrichment and hobbies, and access opportunities in life regardless of disability. According to a 2018 study conducted by the Journal of Blindness Innovation and Research, "individuals who were primary Braille readers since childhood had greater life satisfaction, self-esteem, and job satisfaction than individuals who reported not using Braille as their primary reading medium during childhood."  Additionally, the study found that "[f]indings support the premise that Braille literacy is key to life satisfaction and self-esteem in addition to academic and job success" and that those who are Braille literate are more likely to gain high-quality employment." According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than twenty-four thousand people statewide report low vision or blindness.  The department of education exceptional support branch supports complex areas to support students with disabilities, including low vision or blindness.  Presently, one hundred sixty students in kindergarten through twelfth grade are registered with the American Printing House for the Blind to receive special education materials.  However, only seventeen students have Braille services in their special education programs, creating a significant gap for students to receive equitable educational opportunities.  With limited resources contingent upon individual student needs, a proactive approach is imperative to ensure equity for students with low vision or blindness to succeed in the classroom and prepare for future careers and life goals. The legislature further finds that it is in the interest of the State to make Braille literacy educational services available to all students and members of the greater educational community. Therefore, it is necessary for the State to promote Braille instruction and timely access to Braille instructional materials for low vision or blind students, parents, teachers, and other school personnel. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Establish requirements for access to Braille instructional materials; (2)  Require Braille educational services for students with low vision or blindness to assess individual student abilities and needs; and (3)  Establish a Braille literacy resource center within the department of education. This Act shall be known and cited as the Hawaii Braille Literacy Education Act. SECTION 2.  Chapter 302A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part .  Braille SErvices §302A-    Purpose.  It is a policy of the State to promote Braille literacy and support the provision of Braille educational services needed for eligible low vision or blind students to participate fully in school and prepare students for life beyond the classroom. §302A-    Definitions.  As used in this part: "Braille" has the same meaning as defined in section 302A‑442.5.
