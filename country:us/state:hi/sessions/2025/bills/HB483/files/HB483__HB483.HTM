Section 1:
HB483 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 483 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to Hawaii covert operations. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that given Hawaii's unique geographical position, the urgency of addressing smuggling activities involving humans, weapons, and drugs, as well as other transnational threats such as human trafficking, criminal cartel activities, and illegal immigration, cannot be overstated.  These threats pose significant risks to public safety, particularly in the form of crimes involving child exploitation and sexual offenses, which we must address with the utmost seriousness. The legislature further finds that it is imperative that Hawaii implements stricter penalties and fines to deter these criminal activities and allocate resources for covert operations to disrupt smuggling networks. The purpose of this Act is to reduce crime by establishing the Hawaii covert operations against smuggling and transnational threats program. SECTION 2.  The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Chapter HAWAII COVERT OPERATIONS AGAINST SMUGGLING AND TRANSNATIONAL THREATS § -1  Definitions.  For purposes of this chapter: "Black budget" refers to classified funds allocated for operations critical to state security and effectiveness, modeled on federal allocations for covert activities.
