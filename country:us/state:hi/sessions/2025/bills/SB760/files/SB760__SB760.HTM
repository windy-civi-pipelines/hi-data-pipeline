Section 1:
SB760 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 760 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to land use. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the State possesses a rich ranching history and cowboy culture preceding that of the American west.  In 1793, Captain James Vancouver presented Kamehameha I with six cows and a bull.  Kamehameha I placed a kapu on the cattle to prevent them from being hunted or killed. Over time, the herd flourished and turned feral, becoming a nuisance to Native Hawaiians.  Cattle would rampage through villages and destroy crops, eat the thatch off the roofs of houses, and occasionally hurt or kill people.  In 1832, Kamehameha III sent one of his chiefs to Alta California to enlist cowboys who could teach his people how to work cattle.  The chief returned with three vaqueros who taught aspiring Native Hawaiian cowboys to rope, slaughter, and breed cattle; cure hides; construct fences and paddocks; and ride horses.  Native Hawaiians took quickly to the skills and techniques that the vaqueros introduced. Native Hawaiian cowboys, known as paniolo, iterated on these skills and techniques, creating a distinct Hawaiian cowboy culture.  Paniolo crafted their saddles and gear in a style unique to them, created their own genre of music accompanied by the guitar and ukulele, and also developed a singular Hawaiian style of open-tuning for the guitar called kihoalu, or slack key. The legislature further finds that in 1908, three paniolo, Ikua Purdy, Archie Kaaua, and Jack Low traveled to Cheyenne, Wyoming, to compete in the biggest rodeo at the time, Frontier Days.  In the world championship finals, Ikua Purdy won the steer-roping contest in fifty-six seconds, Archie Kaaua came second, and Jack Low came sixth.  The paniolo shocked much of the American public with their victory over many of America's best cowboys.  When the three paniolo returned to Hawaii, they were hailed as heroes with poetry and hula being composed in their honor. Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to honor the State's rich ranching and paniolo culture by authorizing rodeos on lands zoned for agricultural use. SECTION 2.  Section 205-4.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows: "(a) Within the agricultural district, all lands with soil classified by the land study bureau's detailed land classification as overall (master) productivity rating class A or B and for solar energy facilities, class B or C, shall be restricted to the following permitted uses: (1)  Cultivation of crops, including crops for bioenergy, flowers, vegetables, foliage, fruits, forage, and timber;

(11)  Agricultural parks; (12)  Plantation community subdivisions, which as used in this chapter means an established subdivision or cluster of employee housing, community buildings, and agricultural support buildings on land currently or formerly owned, leased, or operated by a sugar or pineapple plantation; provided that the existing structures may be used or rehabilitated for use, and new employee housing and agricultural support buildings may be allowed on land within the subdivision as follows: (A)  The employee housing is occupied by employees or former employees of the plantation who have a property interest in the land; (B)  The employee housing units not owned by their occupants shall be rented or leased at affordable rates for agricultural workers; or (C)  The agricultural support buildings shall be rented or leased to agricultural business operators or agricultural support services; (13)  Agricultural tourism conducted on a working farm, or a farming operation as defined in section 165-2, for the enjoyment, education, or involvement of visitors; provided that the agricultural tourism activity is accessory and secondary to the principal agricultural use and does not interfere with surrounding farm operations; provided further that this paragraph shall apply only to a county that has adopted ordinances regulating agricultural tourism under section 205-5; (14)  Agricultural tourism activities, including overnight accommodations of twenty-one days or less, for any one stay within a county; provided that this paragraph shall apply only to a county that includes at least three islands and has adopted ordinances regulating agricultural tourism activities pursuant to section 205-5; provided further that the agricultural tourism activities coexist with a bona fide agricultural activity.  For the purposes of this paragraph, "bona fide agricultural activity" means a farming operation as defined in section 165-2; (15)  Wind energy facilities, including the appurtenances associated with the production and transmission of wind generated energy; provided that the wind energy facilities and appurtenances are compatible with agriculture uses and cause minimal adverse impact on agricultural land; (16)  Biofuel processing facilities, including the appurtenances associated with the production and refining of biofuels that is normally considered directly accessory and secondary to the growing of the energy feedstock; provided that biofuel processing facilities and appurtenances do not adversely impact agricultural land and other agricultural uses in the vicinity.
