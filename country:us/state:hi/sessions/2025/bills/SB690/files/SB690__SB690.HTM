SB690 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 690 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to agriculture. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1. The legislature finds that reliable agricultural infrastructure that supports the State's land and water resources is the lifeline of Hawaii's agriculture industry.  Increasing drought events, rain bombs, wildfires, and other crises have highlighted the need for the timely repair and maintenance of the State's agricultural infrastructure.  Sufficient funding is necessary to maintain and improve the State's irrigation systems to ensure that Hawaii's crops receive a steady and dependable supply of water.  Additionally, funding to develop the infrastructure of agricultural lands would provide not only access and other support for local producers to become financially viable, but also new and innovative opportunities to grow the agriculture industry in the State.
