This is to inform you that on July 3, 2025, the following bill was signed into law:

THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE ON AGING.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that low-income subsidy
2 programs, including medicare, medicaid, and medicare savings
3 programs such as medicare part D extra help, can help reduce
4 out-of-pocket costs for individuals with limited income by
5 offsetting their medical and prescription drug costs, such as
6 premiums, deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and lifetime
7 late enrollment penalties. The legislature further finds that
8 although individuals with low income, those who speak English as
9 a second language, or those who live in rural areas may qualify
10 for these programs, they may have no or limited access to the
11 benefits, as they may not be aware of or need assistance with
12 the application or eligibility renewal process.
13 The legislature further finds that the executive office on
14 aging of the department of health provides free information and
15 one-on-one counseling on medicare. Since 2022, the executive
16 office on aging has been receiving a significantly higher volume
17 of referrals from med-QUEST to assist uninsured or underinsured
2025-3261 HB705 GDI HMSO

S.D. 1
C.D. 1
1 individuals who are losing their medicaid eligibility and need
2 to find other health coverage. The overflow and referrals are
3 made to community partners within forty-eight hours to help with
4 food, housing, utilities, employment, and other needs.
5 The legislature also finds that during the COVID-19
6 pandemic, the med-QUEST division of the department of human
7 services paused disenrollments based on eligibility issues and
8 all medicaid members received continuous uninterrupted coverage
9 through March 2023, regardless of their change in eligibility.
10 Following the 2023 Maui wildfires, the med-QUEST division again
11 paused all eligibility disenrollments statewide until the end of
12 2023. However, the med-QUEST division has resumed its annual
13 eligibility redetermination process, and therefore, people have
14 been or will be receiving notices and forms to renew their
15 coverage.
16 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
17 (1) Establish within the executive office on aging a medi-
18 medi project to assist underserved populations in the
19 State who may qualify for various low-income subsidy
20 programs to gain access to their benefits;

5 on aging to develop a one-year pilot project to make
6 available the medi-medi project to kupuna and families
7 living in a disadvantaged community, specifically the
8 Kalihi valley catchment areas.
9 SECTION 2. (a) There is established within the advocacy,
10 education, and outreach section of the executive office on aging
11 a medi-medi project to assist older adults, medicare
12 beneficiaries, individuals with disabilities, and other
13 underserved populations who may qualify for various low-income
14 subsidy programs, including medicare, medicaid, and medicare
15 savings programs such as medicare part D extra help, to gain
16 access to their benefits.
17 (b) The medi-medi project shall:
18 (1) Develop and implement a community outreach program;
19 (2) Streamline the application process for various low-
20 income subsidy programs; and

6 no later than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular
7 session.
8 SECTION 3. There is appropriated out of the general
9 revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $121,016 or so much
10 thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the
11 same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year
12 2026-2027 for the executive office on aging, to be expended as
13 follows:
14 (1) $71,016 for the establishment of one full-time
15 equivalent (1.0 FTE) position to implement and
16 administer the medi-medi project; and
17 (2) $50,000 for operating expenses, including education
18 and outreach.
19 The sums appropriated shall be expended by the executive
20 office on aging for the purposes of this Act.

1 SECTION 4. (a) The legislature finds that the medi-medi
2 project will be able to supplement programs that provide health
3 assessments and wraparound support to kupuna and their families.
4 Additionally, by providing a medi-medi project to kupuna and
5 their families in impoverished communities, the medi-medi
6 project can be expanded to these populations to serve disparate
7 populations living in persistent poverty who are potentially
8 eligible or are enrolled in Medicaid.
9 The purpose of this section is to require and appropriate
10 funds for the executive office on aging to develop a one-year
11 pilot project to provide the medi-medi project to kupuna and
12 families living in a disadvantaged community, specifically the
13 Kalihi valley catchment areas.
14 (b) The executive office on aging shall develop a one-year
15 pilot project to provide the medi-medi project to kupuna and
