(b)  The officer or other person who brings a minor to a detention or shelter facility shall give notice to the court at once, stating the legal basis therefor and the reason why the minor was not released to the minor's parents.  If the facility to which the minor is taken is not an agency of the court, the person in charge of the facility in which the minor is placed shall promptly give notice to the court that the minor is in that person's custody.  Before acceptance of the minor for detention or shelter care, a prompt inquiry shall be made by a duly authorized staff member of the detention or shelter facility or officer of the court.  Where it is deemed in the best interests of the minor, the judge, officer, staff member, or director of detention services may then order the minor to be released, if possible, to the care of the minor's parent, guardian, legal custodian, or other responsible adult, or the judge may order the minor held in the facility subject to further order or placed in some other appropriate facility. (c)  As soon as a minor is detained, the minor's parents, guardian, or legal custodian shall be informed, by personal contact or by notice in writing on forms prescribed by the court, that they may have a prompt hearing held by a circuit judge or district family judge regarding release or detention.  A minor may be released on the order of the judge with or without a hearing.  The director of detention services may order the release of the minor if an order of detention has not been made. (d)  No minor shall be held in a detention facility for juveniles or shelter longer than twenty-four hours, excluding weekends and holidays, unless a petition or motion for revocation of probation[,] or motion for revocation of protective supervision has been filed, or unless the judge orders otherwise after a court hearing.  No ex parte motions shall be considered.  [For the purposes of this section: (1)  Unless a court finds, after a hearing and in writing, that it is in the interest of justice as provided for in subsection (g)(2), a minor believed to come within section 571-11(1), or a minor awaiting trial or another legal process, who is treated as an adult for purposes of prosecution in criminal court and housed in a secure facility shall not: (A)  Have sight or sound contact with adult inmates; or (B)  Be held in any jail or lockup for adults, except as provided in subsection (g)(3); and (2)  Detention in a jail or lockup for adults may be permitted for: (A)  A minor accused of a non-status offense who is held for a period not to exceed six hours; provided that the minor is being held: (i)  For processing or release; (ii)  While awaiting transfer to a juvenile facility; or (iii)  For a court appearance that occurs within the period of detention; or (B)  A minor accused of a non-status offense who is awaiting an initial court appearance that will occur within forty-eight hours of the minor being taken into custody, excluding weekends and holidays, and where the jail or lockup for adults is in a location: (i)  Outside a metropolitan statistical area, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget, and no acceptable alternative placement is available; (ii)  Where the distance to be traveled or the lack of highway, road, or transportation does not allow for court appearances within forty-eight hours, excluding weekends and holidays, such that a brief delay of no more than an additional forty-eight hours is excusable; or (iii)  Where safety concerns exist, such as severe and life-threatening weather conditions that do not allow for reasonably safe travel, in which case the time for an appearance may be delayed until twenty-four hours after the time that conditions allow for reasonably safe travel; provided that the minor shall not have sight or sound contact with adult inmates; provided further that the State shall have a policy in effect that requires individuals who work with both minor and adult inmates in collocated facilities to be trained and certified to work with juveniles.] (e)  No minor [may] shall be held after the filing of a petition or motion, as specified in subsection (d), unless an order for continued detention or shelter has been made by a judge after a court hearing.  If there is probable cause to believe that the minor comes within section 571-11(1), the minor may be securely detained, following a court hearing, in a detention facility for juveniles or may be held in a shelter.  If there is probable cause to believe that the minor comes within section 281-101.5 or 571-11(2), the minor may be held, following a court hearing, in a shelter but shall not be securely detained in a detention facility for juveniles for longer than twenty-four hours, excluding weekends and holidays, unless the minor is subject to the provisions of chapter 582, Interstate Compact on Juveniles, or chapter 582D, Interstate Compact for Juveniles, or is allegedly in or has already been adjudicated for a violation of a valid court order, as provided under the federal Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, as amended. (f)  No minor shall be released from detention except in accordance with this chapter.
