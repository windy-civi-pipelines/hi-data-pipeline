Section 1:
SB1236 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1236 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to the works of art special fund. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that art feeds the human spirit and offers priceless value. Art inspires, educates, and challenges individuals to think differently, while making the world a more beautiful and interesting place.  The legislature further finds that Hawaii was the first state in the nation to adopt a percent-for-art law, which designated one per cent of construction costs of new buildings for the acquisition of works of art through Act 298, Session Laws of Hawaii 1967 (Act 298).  The purpose of the law was to beautify state buildings and increase public access to the arts.  Act 298 statutorily established that "the original construction of any state building shall include ... an amount of one percent of the appropriation for the acquisition of works of art which may be an integral part of the structure ..."  This original statute was carefully crafted to maintain fiscal integrity in the use of long-term capital funding. The legislature expanded on this effort by enacting Act 389, Session Laws of Hawaii 1989, which created the works of art special fund.  The legislature finds that this program has been a success, with works of art enhancing the physical environment of state buildings and providing educational visual arts opportunities to the public through the art in public places program. Additionally, the State currently possesses a surplus of artwork in storage for current and future uses. More recent efforts have focused on the expansion of programs to include performing arts and other initiatives that would enhance an array of art programming across the State.  Even as programs evolve and change over the years, it is imperative that sound financial management be exercised to ensure the stability of factors that may affect the State's creditworthiness. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Specify that the works of art special fund's one per cent transfer requirement shall apply only to capital improvement appropriations for the original construction of state buildings; (2)  Amend the authority for funds from the works of art special fund to solely be used for costs related to the acquisition of works of art; and (3)  Appropriate general funds to, and authorize the use of federal funds for, the state foundation on culture and the arts: (A)  To support certain positions and activities of the state foundation on culture and the arts; (B)  For performing arts initiatives; and (C)  To expand arts programming in schools. SECTION 2.  Section 103-8.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsections (a) and (b) to read as follows: "(a) There is created a works of art special fund, into which shall be transferred one per cent of all state fund appropriations for capital improvements designated for the original construction [cost element; provided that this transfer shall apply only to capital improvement appropriations that are designated for the construction or renovation] of state buildings.  The one per cent transfer requirement shall not apply to appropriations from the passenger facility charge special fund established by section 261-5.5 and the rental motor vehicle customer facility charge special fund established under section 261-5.6. (b)  The works of art special fund shall be used solely for [the following purposes: (1)  Costs] costs related to the acquisition of works of art[, including any consultant or staff services required to carry out the art in public places and relocatable works of art programs; (2)  Site modifications, display, and interpretive work necessary for the exhibition of works of art; (3)  Upkeep services, including maintenance, repair, and restoration of works of art; (4)  Storing and transporting works of art]." SECTION 3.  The following sums or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and fiscal year 2026-2027 are appropriated or authorized, as the case may be, from moneys in the treasury received from general revenues and federal funds to be expended by the state foundation on culture and the arts to finance the positions and other cost items listed below.  The letter symbols used after the specific appropriations indicate the source of financing and have the following meaning:  (A) general revenues, (N)  federal funds.
