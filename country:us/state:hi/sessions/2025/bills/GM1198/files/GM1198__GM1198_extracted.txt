Aloha President Kouchi, Speaker Nakamura, and Members of the Legislature:
This is to inform you that on May 27, 2025, the following bill was signed into law:

THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H |\| U S.D. 1
STATE OF HAWAII . i
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO WILDLIFE CONSERVATION.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAH:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the State is home to
2 a rich diversity of indigenous species of aquatic life,
3 wildlife, and land plants that are vital to maintaining
4 ecological balance and preserving the cultural heritage of the
5 region.
6 The legislature further finds that many of these native
7 species face significant threats from overexploitation, habitat
8 destruction, and climate change, which require immediate and
9 enhanced protective measures to ensure their long-term survival.
10 The legislature recognizes the ‘io, or Hawaiian hawk, as an
11 indigenous species of note, serving as a symbol of strength and
12 resilience in Hawaiian culture and playing a vital role in
13 Hawai'i's unique ecosystem as a native raptor. As an apex
14 predator, the ‘io helps maintain ecological balance, controlling
15 populations of rodents and other invasive species that threaten
16 native flora and fauna. However, the ‘io faces ongoing threats
2025-3011 SB849 HD2 HMSO ;
Page 2
S.B. NO. -1
1 from habitat loss, illegal hunting, and environmental
2 degradation.
3 The legislature declares that the unauthorized taking and
4 killing of indigenous species such as the ‘io not only disrupts
5 ecological systems but also undermines ongoing conservation
6 efforts and risks the loss of irreplaceable biodiversity.
7 Therefore, penalties for harming or endangering indigenous
8 species, including the ‘io, are crucial to deterring these
9 harmful actions to restore Hawai‘i's fragile ecosystems for
10 future generations.
11 However, the legislature believes that the current
12 penalties for violations involving native species do not
13 adequately deter harmful activities. Strengthening these
14 penalties, including the imposition of significant fines and the
15 classification of certain offenses as class C felonies, will
16 provide stronger enforcement tools for the State to protect
17 these critical species.
18 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
19 (1) Prohibit and impose penalties for intentionally
20 taking, harming, or killing ‘io; and
2025-3011 SB849 HD2 HMSO

S.B. NO.
1 (2) Increase penalties and fees for taking and killing
2 species of aquatic life, wildlife, and land plants
3 that are native to the State.
4 SECTION 2. Chapter 195D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
5 amended by adding a new section to part I to be appropriately
6 designated and to read as follows:
7 "§195D- Taking, harming, or killing a Hawaiian hawk;
8 prohibited. Except as otherwise provided in section 183D-62,
9 the intentional taking, harming, or killing of an ‘io, or
10 Hawaiian hawk (Buteo solitarius), shall be subject to penalties
11 under section 195D-9."
12 SECTION 3. Section 195D-9, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
13 amended as follows:
14 1. By amending subsection (a) to read:
15 "(a) Any person who violates any of the provisions of this
16 chapter [+]or[-}-] the provisions of any rule adopted [hcroundor]
17 pursuant to this chapter shall be guilty of [a miodemeaner and
18 ahal-l 'bo punished as follows] :

7 (B) Imprisonment of [aefe] no more than [one year/—e^?
8 feeth-r] two years; or
9 (C) Rehabilitative community service."
10 2. By amending subsections (d) and (e) to read:
11 "(d) Except as otherwise provided by law, the board or its
12 authorized representative by proper delegation [in authorized
