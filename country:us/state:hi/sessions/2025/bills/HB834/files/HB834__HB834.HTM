HB834 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 834 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to TRANSPORTATION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  Electric bicycles have become widely available for personal transportation and are popular among citizens of all ages.  In March 2023, there were five thousand three hundred registered electric bicycles.  This figure is potentially higher considering that many owners do not register their bikes, especially if they are purchased online. Hawaiis law defines electric bicycles as a low-speed bicycle with an assisted maximum speed of less than twenty miles per hour.  While electric bicycles are more convenient and affordable than automobiles, they are a safety hazard when ridden on sidewalks and in the middle of traffic lanes.  Riders often make modifications to electric bicycles with an aftermarket delimiter allowing them to reach speeds of over thirty miles per hour, which is nearly ten times faster than the average walking speed of a person.  Currently, persons under the age of fifteen cannot operate an electric bicycle by law; yet most e-bikes are ridden by adolescents between the ages of twelve and seventeen. In December of 2023, the department of transportation reported nine bicyclist fatalities, the highest recorded number of deaths among bicyclists in Hawaii to date.  Furthermore, electric bicycles can seriously injure pedestrians in a collision and operators are at risk from motorists who do not expect a small, silent, and motorized device riding near them.  The legislature finds, in the wake of a recent surge in ridership accidents, it is critical to address this issue with a comprehensive approach of public outreach in combination with educational campaigns and stricter enforcement against the unlawful use of electric bicycles. The purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Categorize electric bicycles into three classes based on speed and operation; (2)  Establish more stringent regulations for electric bicycles; (3)  Require electric bicycle manufacturers and distributors to apply a label to each electric bicycle specifying the classification number, top assisted speed, and motor wattage of the electric bicycle; and (4)  Impose a requirement that counties inform individuals of the applicable traffic code, safety information, and penalties for violations at the time of registering a bicycle. SECTION 2.  Chapter 291C-143.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "[[]§291C-143.5[]]  [Low-speed electric] Electric bicycles[; operator age].  (a)  This section shall apply whenever an electric bicycle is operated upon any highway, street, roadway, or other designated public area set aside for the use of electric bicycles.

(e)  Any person who operates an electric bicycle recklessly in disregard of the safety of persons or property shall be assessed penalties as set forth in section 291C-161(b). (f)  No person shall operate an electric bicycle at a speed other than is reasonable and prudent and having regard to the actual and potential hazards and conditions then existing; provided that no person shall operate an electric bicycle at a speed greater than twenty-eight miles per hour. (g)  Any electric bicycle shall meet the specifications of and requirements for lamps and other equipment on bicycles as set out in section 291C-147; provided that in lieu of the requirement of section 291C-147(b), every electric bicycle shall be equipped with a lighted lamp that is visible from the rear.

(i)  No electric bicycle shall be operated on a sidewalk, sidewalk area, pedestrian overpass, or pedestrian underpass, except as may be authorized by ordinances or rules adopted by the county. (j)  No person shall tamper with or modify an electric bicycle so as to change the motor-powered speed capability or engagement of an electric bicycle, or the label indicating the classification number. (k)  No person shall operate an electric bicycle after January 1, 2029 unless the electric bicycle has affixed thereto in a prominent location, a manufacturer's label providing the classification number, top assisted speed, and motor wattage of the electric bicycle. (l) The counties by ordinance may impose restrictions and conditions for the regulation and safe operation of electric bicycles with regard to, but not limited to, the following: (1)  Operations in or upon roadways, bikeways, bicycle paths, and sidewalks; (2)  Restrictions on maximum speed; (3)  Safety considerations; and (4)  Hours of operation.
