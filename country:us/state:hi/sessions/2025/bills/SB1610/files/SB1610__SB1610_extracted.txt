Section 1:
SB1610 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1610 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING to ohana zones. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Act 209, Session Laws of 2018 (Act 209), established a pilot program for the establishment of ohana zones, with the goal of improving the health and well-being of individuals experiencing homelessness and providing individuals experiencing homelessness with needed services.  Act 209 required the designation of at least three ohana zone sites on Oahu and one site on each of the neighbor islands. Since the creation of the ohana zones pilot program, the governor designated the statewide office on homelessness and housing solutions, an agency established by Act 252, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022, and administratively attached to the department of human services, to develop, manage, and implement the ohana zones pilot program. The legislature further finds that the 2021 report on the ohana zones pilot program sought to broaden the program beyond temporary housing to promote affordable rental housing for persons transitioning out of homelessness, thus including projects with permanent and semi-permanent housing, such as the Kamaoku kauhale on Oahu for homeless single adults.  The report noted a decrease of 43.7 per cent in the point in time counts from 2016 to 2020 for persons in homeless families, and an overall decrease in homelessness in Hawaii statewide. The legislature further finds that although the ohana zones pilot program was extended to June 30, 2026, by Act 235, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022, noting the success of the program to date, the legislature believes the program should be made permanent to ensure continued support to the homeless population of the State. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish the ohana zones program as a permanent program within the statewide office on homelessness and housing solutions. SECTION 2.  Chapter 346, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to subpart B of part XVIII to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§346-    Ohana zones program; establishment; reports.  (a) There is established within the statewide office on homelessness and housing solutions the ohana zones program to provide temporary housing and services to homeless individuals and families based on principles similar to the housing first program. (b)  The office shall determine the number and locations of the ohana zones, which shall be situated on public or private lands in accordance with subsection (c). (c)  The office may coordinate with public or private entities, as appropriate, to develop and implement the ohana zones program; provided that: (1)  If any public land under the jurisdiction of a state or county agency is determined to be suitable for use as an ohana zone, the office shall: (A)  Work with the appropriate state or county agency that controls the land to transfer the land designated for use as an ohana zone to an agency whose mission is more suited to the management of ohana zones; and (B)  Work with the appropriate state or county agency that controls the land and its construction agency to ensure that an ohana zone's infrastructure needs are met and minimize adverse impacts to the environment, including to nearshore resources such as corals, reef fish, and seabirds; (2)  Use of any private lands determined to be suitable for use as an ohana zone shall be for limited purposes and require a written agreement between the private land owner and any state or county department that any structure built with public funds may be moved or is temporary; provided further that if the land ceases to be used for an ohana zone or low-income housing before the time specified in the agreement, the state or county agency may choose to move the structure off the private land to a location of the state or county agency's choosing; and (3)  The ohana zones program may allow for off-the-grid technologies that can provide drinking water, electricity, and process sewage without existing infrastructure. (d)  The ohana zones program may provide the following facilities and services at each ohana zone site: (1)  Secure dwelling spaces that: (A)  May be private or communal; (B)  Have access to toilets, showers, and other hygiene facilities; and (C)  Have access to an area for food storage and meal preparation; (2)  Medical and social support services; and (3)  Transportation to appointments related to medical care or supportive services that are not available onsite; provided that a person receiving accommodations or services from an ohana zone site may request a ninety-day extension of the person's receipt of accommodations or services, subject to approval by the applicable ohana zone site and other eligibility criteria as determined by each ohana zone site. (e)  Contracts entered into by the office shall be exempt from the requirements of chapters 6E, excluding section 6E-43.6; 46, excluding sections 46-1.5(5)(D), 46-1.5(14)(A)(iii), 46‑88(c)(5), and 46-88(j); 103D; 103F; and 343; provided that no contract entered into pursuant to the ohana zones program or structures constructed thereunder shall be exempt from county, state, or federal floodplain management development standards, or statutes, codes, ordinances, rules, or regulations with which compliance is required under the National Flood Insurance Program. (f)  The office shall establish the following: (1)  The criteria that the agencies will use to evaluate potential ohana zone locations; (2)  A monthly timetable of milestones that the office expects to meet in establishing ohana zones; (3)  The specific, measurable, attainable, reasonable, and time-based performance measures that the office expects to meet at the end of each fiscal year; (4)  The evaluation criteria and process that the office intends to use each year when reviewing the success and sustainability of the ohana zones; and (5)  The monitoring and oversight controls that the office will have over the ohana zones to identify, address, and prevent possible fraud, waste, and abuse and ensure compliance with local, state, and federal laws. (g)  The coordinator shall compile and consolidate information from the office to effectuate this section and submit a report to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular session, which shall include: (1)  A summary and explanation of the process that the office engaged in to identify possible ohana zone locations; (2)  The milestones established pursuant to subsection (f) that were met by the office and ohana zones established during the immediately preceding fiscal year; (3)  An evaluation of the ohana zones to determine whether the objectives set have been met or exceeded; (4)  Any proposed changes that need to be made to the performance measures used to assess the achievement of program goals; (5)  An assessment of the impact of the ohana zone model on the homelessness problem in the State; and (6)  A summary of the information required under subsection (f)." SECTION 3.  Section 201H-36, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsections (a) and (b) to read as follows: "(a) In accordance with section 237-29, the corporation may approve and certify for exemption from general excise taxes any qualified person or firm involved with a newly constructed, or a moderately or substantially rehabilitated, project that is: (1)  Developed under this part; (2)  Developed under a government assistance program approved by the corporation, including but not limited to the United States Department of Agriculture's section 502 direct loan program [and], Federal Housing Administration's section 235 program[;], and the ohana zones program established under section 346-  ; (3)  Developed under the sponsorship of a private nonprofit organization providing home rehabilitation or new homes for qualified families in need of decent, low‑cost housing; (4)  Developed by a qualified person or firm to provide affordable rental housing where at least fifty per cent of the available units are for households with incomes at or below eighty per cent of the area median family income as determined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, of which at least twenty per cent of the available units are for households with incomes at or below sixty per cent of the area median family income as determined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development; or (5)  Approved or certified from July 1, 2018, to June 30, 2030, and developed under a contract described in section 104‑2(i)(2) by a qualified person or firm to provide affordable rental housing through new construction or substantial rehabilitation; provided that: (A)  The allowable general excise tax and use tax costs shall apply to contracting only and shall not exceed $30,000,000 per year in the aggregate for all projects approved and certified by the corporation; and (B)  All available units are for households with incomes at or below one hundred forty per cent of the area median family income as determined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, of which at least twenty per cent of the available units are for households with incomes at or below eighty per cent of the area median family income as determined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development; provided that an owner shall not refuse to lease a unit solely because the applicant holds a voucher or certificate of eligibility under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended.
