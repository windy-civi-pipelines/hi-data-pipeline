Section 1:
SB227 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 227 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO FIREWORKS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that illegal use, possession, and distribution of fireworks continue to endanger public safety, property, and the environment in the State. Despite existing laws and enforcement efforts, unauthorized fireworks persist, causing disturbances and posing significant risks to residents. On June 7, 2023, the governor signed Act 67, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023, into law, establishing an illegal fireworks task force within the department of law enforcement. The illegal fireworks task force was required to develop a comprehensive strategic plan to address the systemic problem of illegal firework trade and usage within the State.  The illegal fireworks task force submitted a final report to the thirty-third legislature containing the task force's findings, recommendations, and proposed legislation, which included a recommendation that the legislature fund a new crime unit within the department of law enforcement to address illegal fireworks enforcement on a full-time basis. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish an illegal fireworks enforcement division within the department of law enforcement to enhance regulatory oversight, increase enforcement, and further coordination among agencies to combat illegal fireworks activities. SECTION 2.  Chapter 353C, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§353C-   Fireworks enforcement division.  (a) There is established within the department of law enforcement an illegal fireworks enforcement division.  The division shall use the findings from the illegal fireworks task force as a basis for developing a comprehensive strategic plan to stop the importation and distribution of illegal fireworks and explosives in Hawaii, promote compliance with the state fireworks control laws, and ensure the safety and security of critical infrastructure against the discharge of illegal fireworks. (b)  An administrator shall be the head of the illegal fireworks enforcement division and shall have charge, direction, and control of the division, subject to the direction and control of the director, of all matters relating to the enforcement of illegal fireworks."
