SB241 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 241 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO STATE FINANCES. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii's natural environment faces significant pressure from climate change and the heavy use of the State's natural resources.  Climate change and overuse are placing the State's natural and cultural resources in increasing peril, creating greater risk of fire, flood, coastal erosion, loss of reefs, and air and water pollution, and threatening lives, homes, visitor accommodations, fisheries, the stability of other natural systems, and irreplaceable Hawaiian cultural landscapes enjoyed by Hawaii residents and visitors.  The current underinvestment in natural and cultural resources significantly limits the ability of the State and its communities to improve management of its lands, waters, and cultural sites to reduce these risks and to respond to climate crises when they occur.  Climate change will intensify and increase the threat of these emergencies unless the State takes significantly greater action now to prevent them. The recent tragedy on Maui due to the Lahaina wildfires resulted in unbearable loss of lives, homes, infrastructure, and businesses, and will have severe ongoing economic costs for residents and public agencies to pay for the response, remediation, and rebuilding, as well as ongoing revenue losses for Hawaii's tourism industry and state and local governments.  This tragic event is a wake-up call for all Hawaii residents, businesses, and public agencies to significantly increase efforts to prevent climate crises and limit the damage when crises do occur. Non-native grasses and other non-native plants, mismanaged lands, and reduced water availability present continuing wildfire risks to the lives and homes of Hawaii residents, hotels and other visitor accommodations, native ecosystems and cultural landscapes, and Hawaii's tourism-dependent economy.  In addition to wildfires, climate crises also result from the loss and degradation of coral reefs that protect homes, beaches, businesses, and infrastructure from coastal erosion.  Coastal erosion often exposes and damages historic Hawaiian burials, as sand dunes were a traditional burial location across Hawaii.  Furthermore, the degradation of coral reefs threatens fisheries and other ocean life that are important to the State's tourism industry, provide food for residents, and contribute significantly to Hawaii's quality of life.  Hawaii's forests and other watershed lands are critical to the quality and the quantity of water that sustains families, visitors, businesses, and native fish and wildlife.  Hawaii's water supplies will be impaired unless greater action is taken to protect and restore forest and watershed lands in the State. The legislature also finds that climate change will cause more frequent and severe droughts that threaten the water supplies that sustain homes, visitor accommodations, and sensitive natural and cultural resources.  Climate change will also cause more intense storms leading to more floods causing water contamination; damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure; and risk of life and health. The legislature further finds that the number of floods per year has already sharply increased since the 1960s and is expected to keep rising.  Significant pollution events and chronic release of contaminants weaken the resiliency of Hawaii's natural environment and pollutes the air, land, fresh water supplies, and nearshore waters threatening the health of Hawaii residents, visitors, and fish and wildlife. Climate crises can cost taxpayers billions of dollars in response and recovery costs and repairs to infrastructure, while reducing revenues, especially if the crises adversely impact tourism and other industries.  The costs borne by the public to respond to and recover from climate crises exceeds the costs of preventing them by billions of dollars. Climate change is impacting health in a myriad of ways, including by leading to death and illness from increasingly frequent extreme weather events such as heatwaves, storms, and floods; disrupted food systems; and increased zoonoses and food‑, water-, and vector-borne diseases and mental health issues.  Climate change can disrupt food availability, reduce access to food, and affect food quality.  Projected increases in temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, changes in extreme weather events, and reductions in water availability may all result in reduced agricultural productivity and disrupt the food chain supply, which could be detrimental to the Hawaiian islands. The work of the department of land and natural resources and other departments, agencies, and community partners directly improves the health and sustainability of Hawaii's lands, waters, and cultural sites through actions such as fencing in native forests to restrict ungulates and stop the spread of invasive species and diseases such as rapid ohia death, stream surveys to monitor native stream species health and water levels, and restoring coral reefs through propagation and release of sea urchins.  Hawaii has many of the solutions to prevent and mitigate climate crises by looking to indigenous Hawaiian land, water, ocean, and cultural site stewardship practices.  Perpetuation of traditional Hawaiian management practices, including fishponds, loi kalo, and mauka-makai ahupuaa management, results in increased groundwater recharge, decreased sediment reaching the ocean and reefs, increased community volunteerism, and increased public education and changed behaviors about pono stewardship practices. While the State has many of the solutions for prevention, the State and the counties currently do not have the needed resources to implement even the highest priority climate crises prevention measures.  Furthermore, delays in federal reimbursements, when available, make it difficult to sustain response efforts when climate crises strike.  The State has a compelling and urgent need to increase funding to prevent climate crises and fully respond to crises when they occur. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish the climate health and environmental action special fund to prevent climate crises and more effectively respond to climate crises when they occur. SECTION 2. The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Chapter CLIMATE HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION SPECIAL FUND §   -1  Definitions.
