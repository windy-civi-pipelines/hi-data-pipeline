C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION,
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that school health
2 assistants may administer medications to students who require
3 certain medications in public schools. However, due to
4 increasing vacancies for school health assistants, many schools
5 experience challenges in meeting the needs of students who are
6 prescribed medications or may benefit from receiving medications
7 in emergency situations while on campus. This lapse of
8 continued care may risk the health and safety of students who
9 rely on the timely administration of certain medications.
10 To ensure the health and safety of students, other school
11 staff who volunteer to administer medication can be effective
12 substitutes once these individuals complete training and general
13 instruction on medication administration. Therefore, requiring
14 volunteers to complete training that includes correctly
15 interpreting the health care provider's orders; identifying the
16 correct student; identifying the correct route of
17 administration, either oral, nasal, or topical; confirming the

C.D. 1
1 correct dose; administering medications at the right time of
2 day; and documenting medication administration, can ensure
3 accountability and the necessary safeguards for student health.
4 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to authorize public
5 school employees or agents who have completed appropriate
6 training to administer medication for students consistent with
7 standards applicable to school health assistants.
8 SECTION 2. Section 302A-853, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
9 amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:
10 "(a) School health assistants, and public school employees
11 and agents trained by a health care professional employed or
12 contracted by the department, may assist students by
13 administering oral, nasal, and topical medication, and in
14 emergency situations, other premeasured medication; provided
15 that:
16 (1) If the student receiving the medication is a minor, a
17 parent or guardian requests and authorizes the
18 administration of medication;
19 (2) The medication has been prescribed by a [licensed]
20 physician[7—as defined in soction--334-l,—or by a
21 practitioner] or physician assistant licensed pursuant
2025-2670 SB532 CDl SMA.docx ;

5 (3) The administration of the medication is with the

7 department, department of health, or health care
8 service as defined in section 323D-2 pursuant to a
9 written agreement with the department; and
10 (4) The administration of the medication is necessary for

14 and stricken. New statutory material is underscored.
