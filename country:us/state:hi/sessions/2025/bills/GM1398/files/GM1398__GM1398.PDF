STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO HOUSING.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1, The legislature finds that the State is facing
2 a housing shortage. A 2019 study cominissioned by the department
3 of business, economic development, and tourism found that, using
4 high scenario projections, the State will require an additional
5 46,573 homes by the year 2030, with the city and county of
6 Honolulu requiring 21,392 new units; Hawaii county requiring
7 13,527 new units; Maui county requiring 8,515 new units; and
8 Kauai county requiring 3,138 new units.
9 The legislature further finds that some of the largest
10 obstacles for developers to construct more housing in the State
11 are:
12 (1) A lack of areas with proper zoning to allow for the
13 construction of residential dwellings;
14 (2) A lack of infrastructure to support newly developed
15 residential dwellings; and
16 (3) Delays in the issuance of building permits for
17 single-family and multi-family projects.

C.D. 1
1 The building permit processing times for single-family and
2 multi-family projects vary tremendously across the United
3 States. However, the counties in Hawaii have some of the
4 longest processing times for residential building permits. An
5 April 2022 study prepared by the university of Hawaii economic
6 research organization found that, on average, Hawaii
7 homebuilders wait three times longer for permits than those in
8 other states, which drives up costs significantly and creates
9 uncertainty, serving as a disincentive to build new projects.
10 Furthermore, the study found that compared to the most regulated
11 markets in the country, Hawaii's permit delays are almost two
12 times longer, meaning it can take from one year to one and a
13 half years for a permit to be approved.
14 The legislature also finds that lengthy processing times to
15 obtain'a building permit raises questions about what information
16 is necessary for counties when processing building permit
17 applications. The basic responsibilities of the counties are to
18 ensure compliance with various building codes and ensure
19 adequate infrastructure capacity to support the proposed project
20 or development. Although it is the counties' responsibility to
21 monitor for compliance with various building codes, if the

C.D. 1
1 construction plans do not satisfy these codes and are not
2 corrected before construction, the designer, who is a licensed
3 professional who stamped the plans, and the contractor are
4 ultimately responsible. The counties are also not typically
5 involved in litigation as the building permit process is
6 ministerial, mainly to check for code compliance.
7 In other municipalities around the country, building plans
8 are not scrutinized to the extent that they are in Hawaii
9 counties. In Hawaii, the plan review is to ensure that the
10 design meets all applicable codes. However, in other
11 municipalities, the plans are used as a guide while code
12 compliance verification is completed upon inspection of the
13 project during construction. Inspectors who find that
14 construction does not satisfy the code either have the
15 correction made in the field or stop construction until proper
16 corrective actions have been taken to ensure that new
17 construction meets the code. Ultimately, the designer and
18 contractor are responsible for ensuring new construction meets
19 all applicable codes.
