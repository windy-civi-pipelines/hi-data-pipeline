ACT 027
S.B. NO. 601.
THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
JAN 1 7 2025
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO THE HAWAII PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITY.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that parking areas and
2 vacant land parcels under the jurisdiction of the Hawaii public
3 housing authority are places where incidents of vandalism and
4 other types of property damage often occurs. In addition,
5 residents of public housing are often forced to cope with
6 litter, trash, and excessive noise in the parking areas of
7 public housing. These unsanitary circumstances and nuisances
8 are often times caused by persons who do not actually reside at
9 the public housing facility. The legislature further finds that
10 closing certain problem areas to the public, coupled with
11 appropriate signage and empowerment of law enforcement to police
12 violators will better enable the Hawaii public housing authority
13 to mitigate or eliminate these concerns.
14 The purpose of this Act is to expressly provide conditions
15 under which all parcels under the jurisdiction of the Hawaii
16 public housing authority and authority offices and facilities

1 may be closed to the public so that trespassing violations may
2 be prosecuted as criminal trespass in the second degree.
3 SECTION 2. Section 356D-6.7, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
4 amended to read as follows:
5 "[-[•]§3560-6.7 [-}-] Closed to the public. (a) Any area
6 within a housing project or on a parcel owned by the authority
7 that is not a public street, road, highway, sidewalk, or county
8 or state bus stop, shall be closed to the public where signs are
9 displayed that read: "Closed to the Public - No Trespassing",
10 or a substantially similar message; provided that the signs:
11 (1) Contain letters no less than two inches in height; and
12 (2) Are placed at reasonable intervals no less than three
13 signs to a mile along the boundary line of the areas
14 that are closed to the public and at all entrances to
15 the property, in a manner and position to be clearly
16 noticeable from outside the boundary line.
17 (b) Any authority office or facility shall be closed to
18 the public during non-business hours where signs are displayed
19 that read: "Closed to the Public - No Trespassing" or a
20 substantially similar message and include hours of operation.
21 (c) For the purposes of this section [-«-
