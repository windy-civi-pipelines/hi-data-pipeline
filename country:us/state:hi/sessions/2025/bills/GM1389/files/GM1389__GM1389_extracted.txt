A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO COGNITIVE ASSESSMENTS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 PART I
2 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that families caring for
3 individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias face
4 many challenges when attempting to balance their professional
5 lives with the provision of care to their loved ones.
6 Caregivers often must choose between continuing their careers or
7 becoming full-time caregivers. According to the Alzheimer's
8 Association, Hawaii has approximately sixty thousand family
9 caregivers providing ninety-one million hours of unpaid care
10 valued at $1,900,000,000.
11 The legislature further finds that 6.7 per cent of
12 individuals aged forty-five or older experience subjective
13 cognitive decline. After age sixty-five, the risk of
14 Alzheimer's disease doubles every five years, with individuals
15 on medicare considered at higher risk of having or developing
16 dementia. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control
17 and Prevention, by 2060, nearly fourteen million adults in the
2025-3310 HB700 CDl HMSO

1 United States are projected to have Alzheimer's disease.
2 Nationwide, the costs to care for individuals living with
3 Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is significant, with
4 the total cost of care for Alzheimer's disease projected to
5 increase to more than $1,100,000,000,000 by 2050. However, a
6 2018 report from the Alzheimer's Association indicated that
7 early diagnosis and treatment of dementia could save the nation
8 as much as $7,900,000,000,000 in medical and care costs over
9 thirty years.
10 The treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease and
11 related dementias is of pressing concern to the State. Per the
12 department of business, economic development, and tourism,
13 nearly one in five residents in Hawaii is sixty-five years of
14 age or older, with this age group rapidly expanding in size.
15 Annually, Alzheimer's and related dementias cost the State's
16 medicaid program $285,000,000. In the Hawaii 2025: State Plan
17 on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias: 2020 Update, the
18 executive office on aging found that medicare costs for the
19 Alzheimer's disease and related dementias population are nearly
20 $10,000 higher in comparison to the non-Alzheimer's disease and
21 related dementias population. The legislature also finds that

1 early detection of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias can
2 reduce costs, manage comorbid conditions, delay disease
3 progression, and allow better care planning. However, data from
4 the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's
5 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System found that over
6 two-thirds of people with memory problems in Hawaii have not
7 talked to their health care provider. Cost may be one factor
8 behind why individuals have not discussed their cognitive health
9 with their health care providers. According to the Individuals'
10 Interest in Cognitive Screening, Dementia Diagnosis, and
11 Treatment: New Estimates from a Population-Representative
12 Sample report published by the RAND Corporation on December 3,
13 2024, eighty per cent of study respondents said they would
14 undergo a cognitive assessment if doing so were free. The
15 legislature notes that medicare beneficiaries who have opted to
16 take medicare part B coverage already receive an annual
17 cognitive assessment as part of their supplemental coverage.
18 This assessment can be performed by any practitioner eligible to
19 report evaluation and management services under medicare,
20 including physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners,
21 and clinical nurse specialists. However, this assessment

1 protocol is severely underutilized. The legislature also finds
2 that broadening the use of cognitive assessments is an important
3 strategy to identify patients who may benefit from current and
4 future treatments for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias,
5 as assessments provide individuals with information that may
6 facilitate actions to prepare for the future.
7 The legislature additionally finds that offering cognitive
8 assessments for medicare beneficiaries aged sixty-five or older
9 is a necessary component of the State's strategic plan to
10 address Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. The
11 legislature believes that simultaneously increasing access to
12 cognitive assessments that are already part of many
13 beneficiaries' supplemental medicare coverage in conjunction
14 with the public health awareness campaign on Alzheimer's disease
15 and related dementias conducted by the executive office on aging
16 as part of the State's strategic plan will significantly improve
17 the health outcomes for Hawaii's older residents.
18 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to improve the
19 detection and treatment of Alzheimer's disease and related
20 dementias in Hawaii by:
