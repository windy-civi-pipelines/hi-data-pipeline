Section 1:
SB1249 HD2 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1249 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 2 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO AGRICULTURE. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  This Act shall be known and may be cited as "Duke's Law" in memory of Cranston "Duke" Pia. SECTION 2.  The legislature finds that agricultural crimes pose a significant and growing threat to the sustainability and vitality of the State's agricultural industry.  These crimes, which include homicide, terroristic threatening, theft, vandalism, trespassing, and illegal hunting on agricultural lands, not only jeopardize the livelihoods of farmers and ranchers but also undermine food security, disrupt local economies, and erode public confidence in the protection of vital resources.  Agriculture remains a cornerstone of the State's economy and cultural heritage, contributing to both economic diversification and community resilience. However, the increasing prevalence of agricultural crimes poses a grave risk to this essential sector. The legislature further finds that unauthorized hunting also significantly impacts agricultural lands.  Livestock endangerment and losses are common when unpermitted hunters disturb farm animals on agricultural lands, and accidental shootings, noise-related stress, and damaged enclosures put livestock at risk, leading to financial losses for farmers and ranchers.  Additionally, the erosion of landowner rights and agricultural stability are also critical concerns, as farmers and ranchers depend on private property rights to maintain secure and productive operations. Unauthorized hunting disregards these rights, undermining responsible land stewardship. Recognizing the complexity and multifaceted nature of agricultural crimes, this Act is designed to provide a comprehensive response by strengthening existing legal frameworks and establishing clearer definitions and penalties for violations related to agriculture and agricultural lands. By differentiating between administrative and criminal penalties, this Act ensures that the consequences of agricultural crimes are proportionate and effective, thereby enhancing deterrence and accountability. Moreover, this Act establishes an agricultural crime prevention program within the department of agriculture, which will play a pivotal role in safeguarding the State's agricultural industry through a combination of grants, educational initiatives, and administrative enforcement measures.  By equipping agricultural property owners and community-based organizations with resources such as surveillance equipment, signage, and fencing, the program seeks to proactively deter criminal activity.  Additionally, it will support partnerships between law enforcement, community groups, and private entities to enhance investigative and prosecutorial efforts. The legislature affirms its commitment to preserving the State's agricultural legacy and protecting the individuals and communities who dedicate themselves to this critical industry.  Through this Act, the State seeks to ensure the safety, integrity, and sustainability of the State's agricultural lands for present and future generations. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Establish an agricultural crime prevention program within the department of agriculture to provide grants, education, administrative enforcement, and other services for the benefit of the State's agricultural industry; (2)  Clarify, create, and strengthen laws regarding crimes and violations related to agriculture or agricultural lands and hunting on private agricultural lands; (3)  Establish clear distinctions between administrative and criminal penalties; and (4)  Appropriate funds for certain positions.

SB1249 HD2 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1249 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 2 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO AGRICULTURE. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  This Act shall be known and may be cited as "Duke's Law" in memory of Cranston "Duke" Pia. SECTION 2.  The legislature finds that agricultural crimes pose a significant and growing threat to the sustainability and vitality of the State's agricultural industry.  These crimes, which include homicide, terroristic threatening, theft, vandalism, trespassing, and illegal hunting on agricultural lands, not only jeopardize the livelihoods of farmers and ranchers but also undermine food security, disrupt local economies, and erode public confidence in the protection of vital resources.  Agriculture remains a cornerstone of the State's economy and cultural heritage, contributing to both economic diversification and community resilience. However, the increasing prevalence of agricultural crimes poses a grave risk to this essential sector. The legislature further finds that unauthorized hunting also significantly impacts agricultural lands.  Livestock endangerment and losses are common when unpermitted hunters disturb farm animals on agricultural lands, and accidental shootings, noise-related stress, and damaged enclosures put livestock at risk, leading to financial losses for farmers and ranchers.  Additionally, the erosion of landowner rights and agricultural stability are also critical concerns, as farmers and ranchers depend on private property rights to maintain secure and productive operations. Unauthorized hunting disregards these rights, undermining responsible land stewardship. Recognizing the complexity and multifaceted nature of agricultural crimes, this Act is designed to provide a comprehensive response by strengthening existing legal frameworks and establishing clearer definitions and penalties for violations related to agriculture and agricultural lands. By differentiating between administrative and criminal penalties, this Act ensures that the consequences of agricultural crimes are proportionate and effective, thereby enhancing deterrence and accountability. Moreover, this Act establishes an agricultural crime prevention program within the department of agriculture, which will play a pivotal role in safeguarding the State's agricultural industry through a combination of grants, educational initiatives, and administrative enforcement measures.  By equipping agricultural property owners and community-based organizations with resources such as surveillance equipment, signage, and fencing, the program seeks to proactively deter criminal activity.  Additionally, it will support partnerships between law enforcement, community groups, and private entities to enhance investigative and prosecutorial efforts. The legislature affirms its commitment to preserving the State's agricultural legacy and protecting the individuals and communities who dedicate themselves to this critical industry.  Through this Act, the State seeks to ensure the safety, integrity, and sustainability of the State's agricultural lands for present and future generations. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Establish an agricultural crime prevention program within the department of agriculture to provide grants, education, administrative enforcement, and other services for the benefit of the State's agricultural industry; (2)  Clarify, create, and strengthen laws regarding crimes and violations related to agriculture or agricultural lands and hunting on private agricultural lands; (3)  Establish clear distinctions between administrative and criminal penalties; and (4)  Appropriate funds for certain positions.
