SB1249 CD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1249 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 2 C.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO AGRICULTURE. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  This Act shall be known and may be cited as "Duke's Law" in memory of Cranston "Duke" Pia. SECTION 2.  The legislature finds that agricultural crimes pose a significant and growing threat to the sustainability and vitality of the State's agricultural industry.  These crimes, which include homicide, terroristic threatening, theft, vandalism, trespassing, and illegal hunting on agricultural lands, not only jeopardize the livelihoods of farmers but also undermine food security, disrupt local economies, and erode public confidence in the protection of vital resources. Agriculture remains a cornerstone of the State's economy and cultural heritage, contributing to both economic diversification and community resilience.  However, the increasing prevalence of agricultural crimes poses a grave risk to this essential sector. The legislature further finds that unauthorized hunting also significantly impacts agricultural lands.  Livestock endangerment and losses are common when unpermitted hunters disturb farm animals on agricultural lands, and accidental shootings, noise-related stress, and damaged enclosures put livestock at risk, leading to financial losses for farmers and ranchers.  Additionally, the erosion of landowner rights and agricultural stability are also critical concerns, as farmers and ranchers depend on private property rights to maintain secure and productive operations. Unauthorized hunting disregards these rights, undermining responsible land stewardship. Recognizing the complexity and multifaceted nature of agricultural crimes, this Act is designed to provide a comprehensive response by strengthening existing legal frameworks and establishing clearer definitions and penalties for violations related to agriculture and agricultural lands.  By differentiating between administrative and criminal penalties, this Act ensures that the consequences of agricultural crimes are proportionate and effective, thereby enhancing deterrence and accountability. The legislature affirms its commitment to preserving the State's agricultural legacy and protecting the individuals and communities who dedicate themselves to this critical industry.  Through this Act, the State seeks to ensure the safety, integrity, and sustainability of the State's agricultural lands for present and future generations. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Establish an agricultural enforcement pilot program within the department of law enforcement on the islands of Oahu and Hawaii, to be implemented at the discretion of the deputy director of law enforcement; (2)  Appropriate funds for and establish positions within the agricultural enforcement pilot program; (3)  Clarify, create, and strengthen laws regarding crimes and violations related to agriculture or agricultural lands and hunting on private agricultural lands; and (4)  Establish clear distinctions between administrative and criminal penalties. PART II SECTION 3.  Chapter 353C, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding one new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§353C-     Agricultural enforcement pilot program.  (a) There shall be established within the department an agricultural enforcement pilot program on the islands of Oahu and Hawaii, to be implemented at the discretion of the deputy director of law enforcement.  The department shall employ or appoint, and remove, the following persons, subject to chapter 76 and section 78-1: (1)  An assistant chief, who shall be the administrator of the agricultural enforcement pilot program and shall have charge, direction, and control, subject to the direction or control of the deputy director, of all matters relating to the enforcement of an offense listed in section 708-835.55 involving theft of an agricultural product or commodity and any other matters as determined by the deputy director.  The assistant chief shall be an administrator experienced in addressing agricultural theft; and (2)  Personnel, state law enforcement officers, and investigators, including but not limited to state law enforcement officers serving on a voluntary basis without pay.

Raw Text:
SB1249 CD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1249 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 2 C.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO AGRICULTURE. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  This Act shall be known and may be cited as "Duke's Law" in memory of Cranston "Duke" Pia. SECTION 2.  The legislature finds that agricultural crimes pose a significant and growing threat to the sustainability and vitality of the State's agricultural industry.  These crimes, which include homicide, terroristic threatening, theft, vandalism, trespassing, and illegal hunting on agricultural lands, not only jeopardize the livelihoods of farmers but also undermine food security, disrupt local economies, and erode public confidence in the protection of vital resources. Agriculture remains a cornerstone of the State's economy and cultural heritage, contributing to both economic diversification and community resilience.  However, the increasing prevalence of agricultural crimes poses a grave risk to this essential sector. The legislature further finds that unauthorized hunting also significantly impacts agricultural lands.  Livestock endangerment and losses are common when unpermitted hunters disturb farm animals on agricultural lands, and accidental shootings, noise-related stress, and damaged enclosures put livestock at risk, leading to financial losses for farmers and ranchers.  Additionally, the erosion of landowner rights and agricultural stability are also critical concerns, as farmers and ranchers depend on private property rights to maintain secure and productive operations. Unauthorized hunting disregards these rights, undermining responsible land stewardship. Recognizing the complexity and multifaceted nature of agricultural crimes, this Act is designed to provide a comprehensive response by strengthening existing legal frameworks and establishing clearer definitions and penalties for violations related to agriculture and agricultural lands.  By differentiating between administrative and criminal penalties, this Act ensures that the consequences of agricultural crimes are proportionate and effective, thereby enhancing deterrence and accountability. The legislature affirms its commitment to preserving the State's agricultural legacy and protecting the individuals and communities who dedicate themselves to this critical industry.  Through this Act, the State seeks to ensure the safety, integrity, and sustainability of the State's agricultural lands for present and future generations. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Establish an agricultural enforcement pilot program within the department of law enforcement on the islands of Oahu and Hawaii, to be implemented at the discretion of the deputy director of law enforcement; (2)  Appropriate funds for and establish positions within the agricultural enforcement pilot program; (3)  Clarify, create, and strengthen laws regarding crimes and violations related to agriculture or agricultural lands and hunting on private agricultural lands; and (4)  Establish clear distinctions between administrative and criminal penalties. PART II SECTION 3.  Chapter 353C, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding one new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§353C-     Agricultural enforcement pilot program.  (a) There shall be established within the department an agricultural enforcement pilot program on the islands of Oahu and Hawaii, to be implemented at the discretion of the deputy director of law enforcement.  The department shall employ or appoint, and remove, the following persons, subject to chapter 76 and section 78-1: (1)  An assistant chief, who shall be the administrator of the agricultural enforcement pilot program and shall have charge, direction, and control, subject to the direction or control of the deputy director, of all matters relating to the enforcement of an offense listed in section 708-835.55 involving theft of an agricultural product or commodity and any other matters as determined by the deputy director.  The assistant chief shall be an administrator experienced in addressing agricultural theft; and (2)  Personnel, state law enforcement officers, and investigators, including but not limited to state law enforcement officers serving on a voluntary basis without pay. (b)  In addition to all police powers and duties, state law enforcement officers in the agricultural enforcement pilot program shall: (1)  Focus on offenses under sections 708-830.5, 708-831, 708-832, and 708-833 that involve the theft of an agricultural product or commodity; (2)  Gather evidence, conduct investigations, and conduct field observations, as required or assigned; (3)  Cooperate with any enforcement authorities of the federal, state, or county government in the development of programs and mutual aid agreements for agricultural activities within the State; and (4)  Carry out other duties and responsibilities as determined by the deputy director.
