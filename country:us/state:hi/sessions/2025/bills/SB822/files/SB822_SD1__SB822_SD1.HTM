If the matter is not resolved by motion, the court may order an evidentiary hearing upon the request of either party.  If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation of the temporary restraining order has occurred, the court shall issue to the landlord a judgment for possession, effective immediately.  The parties named in the petition may file written responses or give oral responses explaining, excusing, justifying, or denying the alleged violation of the temporary restraining order.  The court shall receive at the hearing all relevant evidence and may make independent inquiry.
