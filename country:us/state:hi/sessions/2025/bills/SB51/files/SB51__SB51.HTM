SB51 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 51 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO PUBLIC FINANCING FOR CANDIDATES TO ELECTED OFFICE. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that providing a mechanism to fully fund the elections of candidates for state and county offices who voluntarily agree to abide by campaign fundraising and expenditure guidelines will have significant public benefit.  The common belief is that the current campaign finance system used in Hawaii (and most other states) unfairly favors a small handful of wealthy donors who use their donations to buy access to candidates and elected officials. Comprehensive publicly-funded campaign programs are intended to improve the process by allowing candidates to compete without reliance on private funds and by also allowing elected officials to make decisions without the influence, or appearance thereof, of private individuals, lobbyists, political parties, political action committees, unions, corporations, and other entities. Candidates who choose to participate in Hawaii's comprehensive public funding program established by this Act, after obtaining a minimum of $5 donations from voters, would be barred from soliciting, accepting, or using contributions from any source other than the program's public funds.  This restriction on funding would apply during each participating candidate's campaign and, if elected, throughout the candidate's term in office.  By demonstrating support from voters in the relevant district, the participating candidate justifies receipt of public funding sufficient to run in a primary election and, if successful, the general election. The legislature further finds that public financing of campaigns in some form has existed since the 1970s and was enacted in response to the Watergate scandal. Hawaii became a leader in public funding programs when it added language to the Hawaii State Constitution in 1978 that established the partial public funding program that candidates may continue to use.  Comprehensive public financing programs, sometimes termed "clean elections," were established in 1996 in Maine, in 1998 in Arizona, and have since also been adopted in Connecticut and New Mexico. The legislature further finds that the statewide comprehensive public funding program established by this Act is modeled after the Hawaii county council's comprehensive public funding pilot project that disbursed $363,060 in public funds to a total of sixteen candidates in the 2010 and 2012 county council elections within Hawaii county.  The statewide program proposed by this Act is also informed by Maine's Clean Election Act, which since 2000 has supported legislative and gubernatorial candidates in a state with a population similar to that of Hawaii. Under Maine's program, a state senate candidate would need to obtain at least one hundred seventy-five qualifying contributions in order to be eligible to receive up to $70,000 in public funds, and a gubernatorial candidate would need at least three thousand two hundred qualifying contributions for up to $3,000,000 in public funds.  Comparable levels of public funding will be necessary to ensure that Hawaii's program is practicable for participating candidates. The legislature notes that the annual cost of operating a program to publicly fund candidates is dwarfed in comparison to the state budget of several billion dollars.  The cost is equally eclipsed by the projected increase in public confidence in the State's candidates and elected officials. Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to establish a comprehensive system of public financing for all candidates seeking election to state and county public offices in the State, beginning with the 2026 general election year. SECTION 2. Chapter 11, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new subpart to part XIII to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "        .  Comprehensive Public Funding for Candidates to State and County Offices §11-A  Purpose. The purpose of the comprehensive public financing program, which is a voluntary program, is to improve the electoral process for state and local offices by: (1)  Allowing candidates to compete without relying on money from special interests; (2)  Allowing elected officials to make decisions free from the influence of, or the appearance that they have been influenced by, donations from special interests; (3)  Restoring public confidence in the electoral and legislative processes; and (4)  Increasing meaningful citizen participation. §11-B  Definitions.  Except for terms specifically defined in this subpart, terms that are defined under section 11-302 shall apply to this subpart.  As used in this subpart: "Candidate" means an individual who seeks nomination for election or seeks election to a state or county office in the State.

"Declaration of intent to seek comprehensive public funding" means the form completed by a candidate seeking public funding. "Excess expenditure" means the amount of public funds spent or obligated to be spent by a comprehensive publicly-funded candidate in excess of one hundred per cent of the allocated funds for a primary election, general election, or both.

"Primary election" means a primary, initial special, or initial nonpartisan election. "Primary election campaign period" means the period in a primary election year beginning with the certification for public funding under this subpart and ending on the primary election day. "Public funding", "public funds", "comprehensive public funding", or "comprehensive public funds" means campaign funds from the Hawaii election campaign fund's subaccount for the comprehensive public funding program under section 11-421 that are received by a certified candidate pursuant to this subpart.

SB51 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 51 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO PUBLIC FINANCING FOR CANDIDATES TO ELECTED OFFICE. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that providing a mechanism to fully fund the elections of candidates for state and county offices who voluntarily agree to abide by campaign fundraising and expenditure guidelines will have significant public benefit.  The common belief is that the current campaign finance system used in Hawaii (and most other states) unfairly favors a small handful of wealthy donors who use their donations to buy access to candidates and elected officials. Comprehensive publicly-funded campaign programs are intended to improve the process by allowing candidates to compete without reliance on private funds and by also allowing elected officials to make decisions without the influence, or appearance thereof, of private individuals, lobbyists, political parties, political action committees, unions, corporations, and other entities. Candidates who choose to participate in Hawaii's comprehensive public funding program established by this Act, after obtaining a minimum of $5 donations from voters, would be barred from soliciting, accepting, or using contributions from any source other than the program's public funds.  This restriction on funding would apply during each participating candidate's campaign and, if elected, throughout the candidate's term in office.  By demonstrating support from voters in the relevant district, the participating candidate justifies receipt of public funding sufficient to run in a primary election and, if successful, the general election. The legislature further finds that public financing of campaigns in some form has existed since the 1970s and was enacted in response to the Watergate scandal. Hawaii became a leader in public funding programs when it added language to the Hawaii State Constitution in 1978 that established the partial public funding program that candidates may continue to use.  Comprehensive public financing programs, sometimes termed "clean elections," were established in 1996 in Maine, in 1998 in Arizona, and have since also been adopted in Connecticut and New Mexico. The legislature further finds that the statewide comprehensive public funding program established by this Act is modeled after the Hawaii county council's comprehensive public funding pilot project that disbursed $363,060 in public funds to a total of sixteen candidates in the 2010 and 2012 county council elections within Hawaii county.  The statewide program proposed by this Act is also informed by Maine's Clean Election Act, which since 2000 has supported legislative and gubernatorial candidates in a state with a population similar to that of Hawaii. Under Maine's program, a state senate candidate would need to obtain at least one hundred seventy-five qualifying contributions in order to be eligible to receive up to $70,000 in public funds, and a gubernatorial candidate would need at least three thousand two hundred qualifying contributions for up to $3,000,000 in public funds.  Comparable levels of public funding will be necessary to ensure that Hawaii's program is practicable for participating candidates. The legislature notes that the annual cost of operating a program to publicly fund candidates is dwarfed in comparison to the state budget of several billion dollars.  The cost is equally eclipsed by the projected increase in public confidence in the State's candidates and elected officials. Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to establish a comprehensive system of public financing for all candidates seeking election to state and county public offices in the State, beginning with the 2026 general election year. SECTION 2. Chapter 11, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new subpart to part XIII to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "        .  Comprehensive Public Funding for Candidates to State and County Offices §11-A  Purpose. The purpose of the comprehensive public financing program, which is a voluntary program, is to improve the electoral process for state and local offices by: (1)  Allowing candidates to compete without relying on money from special interests; (2)  Allowing elected officials to make decisions free from the influence of, or the appearance that they have been influenced by, donations from special interests; (3)  Restoring public confidence in the electoral and legislative processes; and (4)  Increasing meaningful citizen participation. §11-B  Definitions.  Except for terms specifically defined in this subpart, terms that are defined under section 11-302 shall apply to this subpart.  As used in this subpart: "Candidate" means an individual who seeks nomination for election or seeks election to a state or county office in the State.
