SB197 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 197 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to public notice. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the State's construction permitting process should be more transparent.  In some cases, affected neighborhoods and communities have not been adequately informed about a project's impacts on health and safety, cultural practices, wildlife, the ecosystem, or the environment.  The protests that occurred in response to the Kahuku windmill project, Thirty Meter Telescope, and other construction projects demonstrated the consequences of foregoing community involvement and input. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to encourage transparency by requiring the department of Hawaiian home lands, department of land and natural resources, and university of Hawaii to inform and obtain the approval of affected neighborhoods and cultural communities before proceeding with certain construction projects. PART II SECTION 2.  Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, as amended, is amended by adding a new section to read as follows: "§     Land use; enhanced public notice requirements; referendum.  (a)  For each project involving a change in land use by the commission, the commission shall: (1)  Within thirty days of filing a permit application, provide public notice pursuant to subsection (b) and as otherwise required by law; (2)  Within four months of filing a permit application, conduct no fewer than three public meetings or hearings.  Notice of the public meetings or hearings shall be made pursuant to subsection (b) and as otherwise required by law; and (3)  Before proceeding with the project, obtain the community's approval of the project through a referendum.  Notice of the referendum shall be made pursuant to subsection (b) and as otherwise required by law.  All adult residents of parcels within five miles of any portion of the proposed project shall be eligible to vote on the referendum.  Any proposed project that does not receive approval by a majority of the votes cast shall be denied; provided that any blank, spoiled, or invalid ballot shall not be tallied as a vote cast.  The office of elections shall assist the commission in conducting the referendum and may adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to effectuate the purposes of this section.  The rules may authorize referendum voting to be conducted by mail. All costs associated with the referendum shall be borne by the commission. (b)  In addition to any other requirements provided by law or rule, public notice for purposes of subsection (a) shall be provided by: (1)  Publishing once a week for four successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation serving areas within five miles of the proposed project; (2)  Mailing notice to each residence within five miles of the proposed project; (3)  Posting notice in multiple publicly accessible locations at the proposed project site, if any; and (4)  Posting notice on an easily accessible page of the commission's website." PART III SECTION 3.  Chapter 171, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part I to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§171- Land use; enhanced public notice requirements; referendum.  (a) For each project involving a change in land use by the department, the department shall: (1)  Within thirty days of filing a permit application, provide public notice pursuant to subsection (b) and as otherwise required by law; (2)  Within four months of filing a permit application, conduct no fewer than three public meetings or hearings.  Notice of the public meetings or hearings shall be made pursuant to subsection (b) and as required by law; and (3)  Before proceeding with the project, obtain the community's approval of the project through a referendum.  Notice of the referendum shall be made pursuant to subsection (b), and as otherwise required by law.  All adult residents of parcels within five miles of any portion of the proposed project shall be eligible to vote on the referendum.  Any proposed project that does not receive approval by a majority of the votes cast shall be denied; provided that any blank, spoiled, or invalid ballot shall not be tallied as a vote cast.  The office of elections shall assist the department in conducting the referendum and may adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to effectuate the purposes of this section.  The rules may authorize referendum voting to be conducted by mail. All costs associated with the referendum shall be borne by the department. (b)  In addition to any other requirements provided by law or rule, public notice for purposes of subsection (a) shall be provided by: (1)  Publishing once a week for four successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation serving areas within five miles of the proposed project; (2)  Mailing notice to each residence within five miles of the proposed project; (3)  Posting notice in multiple publicly accessible locations at the proposed project site, if any; and (4)  Posting notice on an easily accessible page of the department's website."

Leave to intervene shall be freely granted; provided that the commission or its hearing officer, if one is appointed, may deny an application to intervene when in the commission's or hearing officer's sound discretion it appears that: (A)  The position of the applicant for intervention concerning the proposed change is substantially the same as the position of a party already admitted to the proceeding; and (B)  The admission of additional parties will render the proceedings inefficient and unmanageable. A person whose application to intervene is denied may appeal the denial to the circuit court pursuant to section 91-14; and (5)  The commission, pursuant to chapter 91, shall adopt rules governing the intervention of agencies and persons under this subsection.  The rules shall without limitation establish: (A)  The information to be set forth in any application for intervention; (B)  The limits within which applications shall be filed; and (C)  Reasonable filing fees to accompany applications.

The commission may provide by condition that absent substantial commencement of use of the land in accordance with such representations, the commission shall issue and serve upon the party bound by the condition an order to show cause why the property should not revert to its former land use classification or be changed to a more appropriate classification.  [Such] The conditions, if any, shall run with the land and be recorded in the bureau of conveyances. [(h)] (i)  No amendment of a land use district boundary shall be approved unless the commission finds upon the clear preponderance of the evidence that the proposed boundary is reasonable, not violative of section 205-2 and part III of this chapter, and consistent with the policies and criteria established pursuant to sections 205-16 and 205-17.  Six affirmative votes of the commission shall be necessary for any boundary amendment under this section.
