THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE. 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
A BILL FORAN ACT
RELATING TO MIDWIVES.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the State first
2 began regulating midwives in 1931 by establishing a registration
(
3 requirement, which subsequently progressed to certification and
4 finally, licensure. However, the regulation of midwives was
5 repealed when, in 1998, nurse-midwives were placed under the
6 purview of the board of nursing. Despite the lack of
7 regulation, many individuals continued to practice midwifery and
8 many families in the community sought out midwifery services.
9 The legislature also finds that, per the Hawaii Regulatory
10 Licensing Reform Act, the State is required to regulate
11 professions or vocations where the health, safety, or welfare of
12 the consumer may be jeopardized by the nature of the service
13 offered by the provider. In 1998 and 2017, the legislature
14 requested the state auditor to conduct a sunrise analysis to
15 determine if regulation of midwives was warranted. While the
16 sunrise analysis conducted in 1998 through 1999 and reported in
17 Auditor's Report No. 99-14 determined that it was premature to
20-25-2638 HB1194 SD3 SMA.docx

H.B. NO.
1 regulate midwives at that time, that report and the 2017
2 Auditor's Report No. 17-01 both determined that the nature of
3 the maternity and prenatal services provided by a midwife may
4 endanger the health and safety of women and newborns under the
5 midwife's care and, therefore, the profession of midwifery
6 should be subject to regulation. The Auditor's Report No. 17-01
7 in particular recommended the legislature consider establishing
8 a mandatory licensing framework for all midwives. Recognizing
9 the potential for harm to public health and safety posed by the
10 unregulated practice of midwifery, the legislature passed Act
11 32, Session Laws of Hawaii 2019 {Act 32), and established a
12 regulatory framework for the practice of midwifery that was
13 subsequently codified at chapter 457J, Hawaii Revised Statutes
14 (chapter 457J). Since the passage of Act 32, approximately
15 forty-one individuals have been licensed under chapter 457J.
16 These regulations are set to sunset on June 30, 2025, unless the
17 legislature takes action to continue the regulation of midwives.
18 The legislature further finds that, as part of its sunset
19 analysis, and reported in Auditor's Summary Report No. 25-03
20 (2025), the auditor found that the practice of midwifery posed a
21 clear and significant potential harm to the health and safety of
2025-2638 HB1194 SD3 SMA.docx

H.B. NO.
1 the public and that the State's policies regarding the
2 regulation of certain types of professions support the continued
3 regulation of the practice of midwifery in the form of full
4 licensure.
5 The legislature affirms that the practice of midwifery
6 under this Act does not include Native Hawaiian traditional and
7 customary practices. The legislature also affirms that
8 practicing midwifery according to this Act does not impede one's
9 ability to incorporate or provide cultural practices.
10 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
11 (1) Make regulatory laws for the practice of midwifery
12 permanent;
13 (2) Clarify the scope of practice of midwifery and
14 establish licensure requirements for certified
15 midwives and certified professional midwives,
16 including continuing education requirements;
17 (3) Grant global signature authority to midwives;
18 (4) Grant prescriptive authority to certified midwives and
19 amend the list of approved legend drugs that may be
20 administered by licensed midwives;

1 (5) Establish peer review and data submission requirements

4 Native Hawaiian traditional and customary practices;
5 (7) Clarify exemptions from licensure and grounds for
6 refusal to grant, renew, reinstate, or restore
7 licenses or for revocation, suspension, denial, or
8 condition of a license; and
9 (8) Clarify medical record availability and retention
10 requirements for the purposes of medical torts.
11 SECTION 2. Chapter 457J, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
12 amended by adding eight new sections to be appropriately
13 designated and to read as follows:
14 "§4 57J-A Scope of practice of midwifery. (a) The scope
15 of practice of midwifery means the full practice of midwifery,
