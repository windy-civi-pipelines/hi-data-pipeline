<p class=RegularParagraphs>     SECTION 1.  <span style='color:black'>The
legislature finds that it is becoming increasingly difficult to recruit and
retain state employees.  Having affordable rental and homeownership opportunities
for state employees will reduce the resignation and outmigration of state
employees and fill critical labor needs throughout state government.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span style='color:black'>     The legislature
further finds that with Honolulu's construction of an elevated rail transit
system, the State has an opportunity to enhance Oahu's urban environment and
increase the quality of life for residents by increasing the affordable housing
inventory and eliminating the need for personal automobiles, among other public
benefits.  As the largest landowner of transit-oriented development sites along
the transit line in Honolulu, as well as being the landowner of other
transit-oriented development sites in each of the other counties, the State and
its various departments and attached agencies must be proactive in establishing
a unified vision and approach toward redevelopment of its transit-oriented
development sites statewide to maximize the benefits of state lands available
for redevelopment.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span style='color:black'>     The purpose of this
Act is to establish within the Hawaii housing finance and development
corporation:</span></p>

thereafter be taken for any other public use without the consent of the corporation. 
No award of compensation shall be increased by reason of any increase in the

site or plan adopted pursuant to a designation, or the actual or proposed
acquisition, use, or disposition of any other real property by the corporation.</p>
