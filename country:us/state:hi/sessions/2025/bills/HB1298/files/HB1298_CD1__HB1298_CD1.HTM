HB1298 CD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1298 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 3 STATE OF HAWAII S.D. 1 C.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO HOUSING. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that it is becoming increasingly difficult to recruit and retain state employees.  Having affordable rental opportunities for state employees will reduce the resignation and outmigration of state employees and fill critical labor needs throughout state government. The legislature further finds that with the city and county of Honolulu's construction of an elevated rail transit system, the State has an opportunity to enhance Oahu's urban environment and increase the quality of life for residents by increasing the affordable housing inventory and eliminating the need for personal automobiles, among other public benefits.  As the largest landowner of transit-oriented development sites along the transit line in the city and county of Honolulu, as well as being the landowner of other transit-oriented development sites in each of the other counties, the State and its various departments and attached agencies must be proactive in establishing a unified vision and approach toward redevelopment of its transit-oriented development sites statewide to maximize the benefits of state lands available for redevelopment. The purpose of this Act is to establish within the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation a government employee housing program, to be financed by the dwelling unit revolving fund. SECTION 2.  Chapter 201H, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "PART .  GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE HOUSING PROGRAM §201H-     Purpose. The purpose of this part is to establish a government employee housing program to facilitate the creation of affordable residential rental units for rent to government employees and the general public on state-owned land. §201H-     Definitions.  As used in this part, unless the context otherwise requires: "Mixed-use project" means a mixed-use development as defined in section 201H-12(a).

"Transit-oriented development site" means non-ceded state‑owned lands within a one-mile radius of a planned or existing station connected to a locally preferred alternative for a mass transit project. §201H-     Government employee housing program.  (a) There shall be established within the corporation the governmental employee housing program for the purpose of providing affordable and low-cost rental housing units for rent to government employees and general public on state-owned land, to be financed by the dwelling unit revolving fund established pursuant to section 201H-191. (b) The program shall be limited to one project on a transit-oriented development site, which shall be selected by the corporation. §201H-     Government employee housing projects; criteria.  (a)  Government employee housing projects developed under this part shall be intended primarily for government employees in the following order of priority: (1)  Newly hired permanent full-time state employees; (2)  Other permanent full-time state employees; (3)  Permanent full-time county employees; (4)  Permanent part-time state and county employees; (5)  Temporary state and county employees; and (6)  The general public.

The annual report shall include the feasibility of expanding the program and the demand for residential rental projects developed under this part. §201H-     Additional powers.  The powers conferred upon the corporation by this part shall be in addition and supplemental to the powers conferred by any other law, and nothing in this part shall be construed as limiting any powers, rights, privileges, or immunities so conferred. §201H-     Acquisition of real property from a county.  Notwithstanding the provision of any law or charter, any county, by resolution of its county council, without public auction, sealed bids, or public notice, may sell, lease, grant, or convey to the corporation any real property owned by the county that the corporation certifies to be necessary for the purposes of this part.  The sale, lease, grant, or conveyance shall be made with or without consideration and upon terms and conditions as may be agreed upon by the county and the corporation.
