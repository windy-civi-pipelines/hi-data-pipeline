Section 1:
HB498 HD2 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 498 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO AGRICULTURAL CRIMES. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that in 2019, the United States Department of Agriculture recorded a total estimated loss of $14,400,000 nationwide from theft and vandalism within the agricultural sector.  Trespass and the theft of farm equipment, agricultural products, commodities, livestock and cattle, and other related resources, in addition to illegal hunting and poaching, are some of the traditionally reported crimes in the agricultural sector.  However, recent reports of violent crimes and fatal shootings on agricultural land on Oahu's leeward coast have highlighted the severity of the challenges facing the State in how to effectively mitigate and prevent agricultural crimes. The legislature additionally finds that the State lacks a dedicated law enforcement unit designed and equipped to address the unique and specific types of crimes that occur within the agricultural sector. Often, these crimes occur in rural and geographically isolated locations, making it challenging to timely respond to and adequately address reports of the crimes.  Moreover, it can be burdensome, if not impossible, for large tracts of land, farms, and ranches to implement traditional crime deterrence methods, such as adequate lighting and fencing, alarm systems, surveillance, and private security or increased police presence.  Low police staffing and watch strength in rural locations can exacerbate already existing limitations in security measures for farmers and add to the vulnerability of these agricultural properties. The legislature recognizes that, while agricultural lands are protected by many of the State's laws establishing certain crimes, limited resources make it difficult to respond to these crimes effectively.  Further, due to these limited resources, traditional enforcement efforts tend to prioritize more high-profile violent crimes, resulting in a low prosecution rate for agricultural crimes.  This is evidenced by the fact that agricultural crimes are typically included in general crime statistics reported by various law enforcement agencies, which often makes it challenging to gather important data pertinent specifically to agricultural crimes.  Despite statistics that have been made available through self-reporting, prosecution rates for agricultural crimes remain low. The legislature further finds that certain counties in California with large agricultural-based economies have had success in implementing crime prevention programs to address the issues related to agricultural crimes through targeted enforcement and prevention strategies, including the utilization of a centralized database to track incidents of agricultural crime, analyze trends, and share intelligence among agencies to enable a swift response to emerging threats.  These programs have also contributed to efforts in advocating for legislative changes to strengthen agricultural laws and penalties and shaping policies that reflect the importance of protecting the agricultural industry. It is therefore the legislature's intent to establish a similar program through the creation of the Hawaii agricultural crimes council to help the State address resource limitations and enforcement capabilities, enhance data collection, identify and mitigate criminality, provide education and awareness, and restore public trust in law enforcement to adequately prosecute agricultural crimes. The legislature finds that there is no existing consistent and reliable funding mechanism in place to support the efforts of an independent agency to enforce laws related to agricultural crimes, such as the Hawaii agricultural crimes council.  The legislature further finds that secure funding for the Hawaii agricultural crimes council is necessary to ensure its continued operation and functions, including but not limited to the purchase of necessary equipment and funds for position salaries. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Establish the Hawaii agricultural crimes council; (2)  Require the department of agriculture to collaborate with and support the council; (3)  Establish the agricultural enforcement special fund; and (4)  Provide dedicated funding for the council's establishment and continued operations. SECTION 2.  The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Chapter hawaii AGRICULTURAL crimes council §   -1  Definitions.  In this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires: "Council" means the Hawaii agricultural crimes council.
