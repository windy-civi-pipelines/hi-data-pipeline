(7) If the court orders the defendant to make restitution to financially support the child under this section and the surviving parent or legal guardian subsequently brings a civil action and obtains a judgment, the restitution order shall be offset by the amount of the judgment awarded and paid by the defendant or the defendant's insurance for lost wages."
