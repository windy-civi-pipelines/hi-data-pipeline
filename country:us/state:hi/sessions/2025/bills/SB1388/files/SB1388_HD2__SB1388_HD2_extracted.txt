Section 1:
SB1388 HD2 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1388 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 2 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO EDUCATION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the school facilities authority was established to oversee the development, planning, and construction of public school facilities across the State, ensuring that schools meet the infrastructure needs of students, staff, and communities.  Currently, the school facilities authority board consists of five voting members appointed by the governor. The department of education is critical to the successful implementation of school facilities projects through its understanding of educational needs and administrative priorities.  There is a need to strengthen collaboration between the department of education and school facilities authority to ensure that the planning and development of school facilities are aligned with the educational goals and requirements of Hawaii's public education system. The legislature further finds that the board of education, which oversees the department of education, brings a perspective on educational governance and policy.  Incorporating representatives from the department of education and board of education as ex officio, nonvoting members of the school facilities authority board will ensure the department of education's strategic priorities are represented in the school facilities authority's projects and enhance the accountability and responsiveness of the school facilities authority to the needs of students, educators, and the community. The purpose of this Act is to add the superintendent of education and chairperson of the board of education, or their designees, to the school facilities authority board as ex officio, nonvoting members.
