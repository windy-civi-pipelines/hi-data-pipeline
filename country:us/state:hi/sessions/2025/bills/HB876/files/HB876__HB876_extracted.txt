Section 1:
HB876 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 876 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to healthcare preceptors. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that there is a shortage of health care providers in the State, particularly primary care providers, which will be exacerbated by the projected retirement of current physicians, advanced practice registered nurses, pharmacists, and other health care workers.  Although students are interested in pursuing careers in Hawaii's health care service industry, in-state educational institutions are constrained by the lack of clinical education sites in the State and the limited supply of qualified preceptors.  One way to encourage the participation of preceptors is to offer an income tax credit for health care professionals who serve as preceptors. The purpose of the existing healthcare preceptor income tax credit is to incentivize volunteer preceptors to offer professional instruction, training, and supervision to students and residents seeking careers as health care providers in the State.  During the implementation of the tax credit, many providers trained eligible students, but only a small subset met the eligibility requirements due to the primary care qualifying criterion for the preceptor. The legislature recognizes that programs training physicians, advanced practice registered nurses, pharmacists, and physician assistants in primary care also require training from specialty preceptors.  The legislature further recognizes that the health care workforce has shortages in professions beyond those included in the tax credit and whose workforce expansion is also limited by available preceptors, including psychologists, physician assistants, marriage and family therapists, mental health counselors, clinical social workers, rehabilitation counselors, and school counselors.  As such, the healthcare preceptor tax credit should not be limited to physicians, advanced practice registered nurses, and pharmacists and should be expanded. Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Include psychology, physician assistant, marriage and family therapist, mental health counselor, clinical social worker, rehabilitation counselor, and school counselor students in the definition of "eligible student"; and (2)  Amend the definition of "preceptor", including adding psychologists, physician assistants, marriage and family therapists, mental health counselors, clinical social workers, rehabilitation counselors, and school counselors to the list of preceptors eligible to receive a tax credit. SECTION 2.  Section 235-110.25, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (g) to read as follows: "(g)  For the purposes of this section: "Academic program" means an academic degree granting program or graduate medical education program that: (1)  Holds either its principal accreditation or a physical location in Hawaii; and (2)  Provides education to students, of whom more than fifty per cent are residents of Hawaii.
