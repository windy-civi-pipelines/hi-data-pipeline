Section 1:
SB370 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 370 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to midwives. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Act 32, Session Laws of Hawaii 2019 (Act 32), created a licensure program to regulate non-nurse midwives.  The intent of the program was to provide the benefits of licensure while also "allow[ing] a woman to choose where and with whom she gives birth."  The legislature noted in Act 32 that "mothers and families seek out alternatives to hospital births and they find significant value in community or home birth services."  The legislature also found that "these services have been provided by individuals identifying themselves as traditional or cultural practitioners, midwives, certified professional midwives, lay midwives, direct entry midwives, birth keepers, or birth attendants."  The licensure program established by Act 32, enacted as chapter 457J, Hawaii Revised Statutes (chapter 457J), has run for five years and will sunset on June 30, 2025. Under chapter 457J, only certified midwives and certified professional midwives are eligible for licensure.  However, Act 32 noted that "by the end of the three-year period (2022), the legislature intends to enact statutes that will incorporate all birth practitioners and allow them to practice to the fullest extent under the law.  While significant efforts were made, this goal has not yet been achieved.  A temporary exemption for birth attendants other than certified midwives or certified professional midwives expired in 2023, and no other exemptions have been implemented. Since the enactment of chapter 457J, more than forty midwives have been licensed, although currently, less than half of these provide full-time midwifery care. Of these forty newly licensed midwives, approximately twenty-two per cent do not currently reside in the State, none are Native Hawaiian, and ninety-seven per cent are not originally from Hawaii.  In 2023, midwives attended 1.9 per cent of all births, reflecting a seventy-three per cent increase in the use of midwives.  At the same time, since chapter 457J took effect, the number of home births that were unattended or attended by unknown providers have increased by forty-two per cent. The intent of this Act is to continue licensure for certified midwives and certified professional midwives, while fulfilling the legislature's original intent to allow all birth practitioners to practice legally.  The legislature finds that licensure for certified midwives and certified professional midwives is beneficial only if the legislature also creates locally accessible pathways to these certifications and clarifies the full scope of practice for certified midwives based on national standards. The legislature recognizes that, for many people, decisions about pregnancy and birth are informed by their personal or community history and culture and are experiences of great social, cultural, and spiritual significance.  For many people, pregnancy and birth are not primarily medical events.  As such, there are a wide range of traditional birth practitioners - for example, pale keiki, lola, and sanba - as well as birth-related service providers like doulas, lactation consultants, birth coaches, and others whose care and advice are important to the well-being of birthing people and their families. The legislature believes that the midwife licensing program established by Act 32 was an important step toward recognizing the practice of non-nurse midwifery; however, some changes are still needed.  In its review of chapter 457J and its implications, the Hawaii home birth task force's final report reflected unanimous agreement on the need for improved understanding of out-of-hospital births, as well as relationship building.  The report also emphasized the need to allow traditional midwives and other birth practitioners to continue to serve their communities. The legislature notes that the implementation of chapter 457J provided valuable insight into the complexity of community birth settings in Hawaii.  Some of the urgent needs identified in this process include the following: (1)  Safety.  Research highlighted by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and in the White House Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis (June 2022) suggests that legal access to culturally responsive care of the birthing person's choosing, including traditional practices of that person's culture, is strongly corelated with increased safety and well-being. Removing barriers to this care is essential.  Home birth with either a licensed or traditional midwife has been found to be safe, whereas illegality jeopardizes safety.  For example, if complications arise during a home birth, effective communication during the hospital transport is important.  Stigma associated with the illegality of using a chosen birth attendant may cause parents to delay transport or withhold information, impeding communication between providers.  Safety is therefore best served by protecting access to all types of birthing assistance. (2)  Access to care.  There is a severe lack of overall access to maternal health care in Hawaii, which must be considered in the context of environment and culture.  Due to extreme provider shortages and limited facilities, many pregnant people on neighbor islands are forced to fly off-island in order to give birth, often with no family or other support. Many pregnant and birthing people have no realistic access to prenatal or postpartum care. In response to this crisis, all three neighbor island counties (Hawaii, Kauai, and Maui) passed resolutions in 2023 urging the legislature to "enact a statute exempting birth attendants from state licensure requirements".  Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders have the highest rates of maternal mortality in the United States, according to recent data from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  These statistics have not been associated with out‑of‑hospital births but are strongly correlated with a lack of access to culturally competent care.  Access is best served by keeping all care options legally accessible, while long-term comprehensive solutions are developed. (3)  Culture.  The need for genuine cultural care, as well as for the revitalization of indigenous traditions and self-determination has been highlighted in data and scholarship produced within the last two years.  While Act 32 states that "practicing midwifery according to [the law] does not impede one's ability to incorporate or provide cultural practices," the State's courts have found that, in practice, the transmission of constitutionally protected customs was impeded, and it emphasized the importance of protecting endangered indigenous traditions that might be lost. The emergence of a new generation of local birth-related practitioners carrying the traditions of a diverse variety of cultures has also been identified as important. (4)  Licensing equality.  In the entire United States, there are only two schools for certified midwives accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Midwifery Education and eight schools for certified professional midwives accredited by the Midwifery Education Accreditation Council.  None of these schools are located in Hawaii.  Limiting certification pathways to those that are prohibitively difficult for residents of Hawaii to pursue displaces Hawaii practitioners and limits patients' access to culturally informed, community-based care. Balancing equities by assuring access to licensure for Hawaii residents is important. The Hawaii Regulatory Licensing Reform Act, codified as chapter 26H, Hawaii Revised Statutes, requires the State to regulate professions only "when the health, safety, or welfare of the consumer may be jeopardized by the nature of the service".  The analysis must be based on "evidence of abuses by providers of the service" and other actual evidence to determine whether regulation is desirable. Chapter 26H also requires that any professional regulations "not unreasonably restrict entry into professions and vocations by all qualified persons."  The law notes that "the purpose of regulation shall be the protection of the public welfare and not that of the regulated profession or vocation".  The law also requires regulations to be eliminated "when the legislature determines that they have no further benefits to consumers". Based on this analysis, the legislature finds that the regulation of certified midwives and certified professional midwives, who utilize prescription drugs, modern instrumentations, and techniques such as intravenous fluid administration, is reasonable and beneficial to consumers; provided that additional pathways are made available for qualified local Hawaii practitioners to achieve licensure.  Regulation by the State of the birth practices of traditional and non-clinical practitioners and extended or hanai family members is not supported or required by the Hawaii Regulatory Licensing Reform Act. The legislature's intent is to allow a person to choose where and with whom they give birth by ensuring the legality of all practices used by any birthing person, while also building comprehensive solutions that address the complexity of community needs and cultural considerations in Hawaii. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Provide for the continued licensure of certified midwives and certified professional midwives by the department of commerce and consumer affairs; (2)  Identify the scope of practice for a licensed midwife, including the ability to provide independent midwifery services in hospitals, clinics, freestanding birthing facilities, community birthing settings, and the home; (3)  Clarify that the services of licensed midwives are eligible for insurance reimbursement; (4)  Prohibit persons from identifying as certified midwives or certified professional midwives, unless those persons are appropriately licensed; and (5)  Temporarily re-establish the home birth task force to provide additional recommendations on issues related to home births. PART II SECTION 2.  Section 26H-4, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§26H-4  Repeal dates for newly enacted professional and vocational regulatory programs.  [(a)] Any professional or vocational regulatory program enacted after January 1, 1994, and listed in this section shall be repealed as specified in this section.  The auditor shall perform an evaluation of the program, pursuant to section 26H-5, before its repeal date. [(b)  Chapter 457J (midwives) shall be repealed on June 30, 2025.]" SECTION 3.  Chapter 457J, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part   .  certified midwives and certified professional midwives §457J-A  Definitions.

Raw Text:
SB370 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 370 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to midwives. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Act 32, Session Laws of Hawaii 2019 (Act 32), created a licensure program to regulate non-nurse midwives.  The intent of the program was to provide the benefits of licensure while also "allow[ing] a woman to choose where and with whom she gives birth."  The legislature noted in Act 32 that "mothers and families seek out alternatives to hospital births and they find significant value in community or home birth services."  The legislature also found that "these services have been provided by individuals identifying themselves as traditional or cultural practitioners, midwives, certified professional midwives, lay midwives, direct entry midwives, birth keepers, or birth attendants."  The licensure program established by Act 32, enacted as chapter 457J, Hawaii Revised Statutes (chapter 457J), has run for five years and will sunset on June 30, 2025. Under chapter 457J, only certified midwives and certified professional midwives are eligible for licensure.  However, Act 32 noted that "by the end of the three-year period (2022), the legislature intends to enact statutes that will incorporate all birth practitioners and allow them to practice to the fullest extent under the law.  While significant efforts were made, this goal has not yet been achieved.  A temporary exemption for birth attendants other than certified midwives or certified professional midwives expired in 2023, and no other exemptions have been implemented. Since the enactment of chapter 457J, more than forty midwives have been licensed, although currently, less than half of these provide full-time midwifery care. Of these forty newly licensed midwives, approximately twenty-two per cent do not currently reside in the State, none are Native Hawaiian, and ninety-seven per cent are not originally from Hawaii.  In 2023, midwives attended 1.9 per cent of all births, reflecting a seventy-three per cent increase in the use of midwives.  At the same time, since chapter 457J took effect, the number of home births that were unattended or attended by unknown providers have increased by forty-two per cent. The intent of this Act is to continue licensure for certified midwives and certified professional midwives, while fulfilling the legislature's original intent to allow all birth practitioners to practice legally.  The legislature finds that licensure for certified midwives and certified professional midwives is beneficial only if the legislature also creates locally accessible pathways to these certifications and clarifies the full scope of practice for certified midwives based on national standards. The legislature recognizes that, for many people, decisions about pregnancy and birth are informed by their personal or community history and culture and are experiences of great social, cultural, and spiritual significance.  For many people, pregnancy and birth are not primarily medical events.  As such, there are a wide range of traditional birth practitioners - for example, pale keiki, lola, and sanba - as well as birth-related service providers like doulas, lactation consultants, birth coaches, and others whose care and advice are important to the well-being of birthing people and their families. The legislature believes that the midwife licensing program established by Act 32 was an important step toward recognizing the practice of non-nurse midwifery; however, some changes are still needed.  In its review of chapter 457J and its implications, the Hawaii home birth task force's final report reflected unanimous agreement on the need for improved understanding of out-of-hospital births, as well as relationship building.  The report also emphasized the need to allow traditional midwives and other birth practitioners to continue to serve their communities. The legislature notes that the implementation of chapter 457J provided valuable insight into the complexity of community birth settings in Hawaii.  Some of the urgent needs identified in this process include the following: (1)  Safety.  Research highlighted by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and in the White House Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis (June 2022) suggests that legal access to culturally responsive care of the birthing person's choosing, including traditional practices of that person's culture, is strongly corelated with increased safety and well-being. Removing barriers to this care is essential.  Home birth with either a licensed or traditional midwife has been found to be safe, whereas illegality jeopardizes safety.  For example, if complications arise during a home birth, effective communication during the hospital transport is important.  Stigma associated with the illegality of using a chosen birth attendant may cause parents to delay transport or withhold information, impeding communication between providers.  Safety is therefore best served by protecting access to all types of birthing assistance. (2)  Access to care.  There is a severe lack of overall access to maternal health care in Hawaii, which must be considered in the context of environment and culture.  Due to extreme provider shortages and limited facilities, many pregnant people on neighbor islands are forced to fly off-island in order to give birth, often with no family or other support. Many pregnant and birthing people have no realistic access to prenatal or postpartum care. In response to this crisis, all three neighbor island counties (Hawaii, Kauai, and Maui) passed resolutions in 2023 urging the legislature to "enact a statute exempting birth attendants from state licensure requirements".  Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders have the highest rates of maternal mortality in the United States, according to recent data from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  These statistics have not been associated with out‑of‑hospital births but are strongly correlated with a lack of access to culturally competent care.  Access is best served by keeping all care options legally accessible, while long-term comprehensive solutions are developed. (3)  Culture.  The need for genuine cultural care, as well as for the revitalization of indigenous traditions and self-determination has been highlighted in data and scholarship produced within the last two years.  While Act 32 states that "practicing midwifery according to [the law] does not impede one's ability to incorporate or provide cultural practices," the State's courts have found that, in practice, the transmission of constitutionally protected customs was impeded, and it emphasized the importance of protecting endangered indigenous traditions that might be lost. The emergence of a new generation of local birth-related practitioners carrying the traditions of a diverse variety of cultures has also been identified as important. (4)  Licensing equality.  In the entire United States, there are only two schools for certified midwives accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Midwifery Education and eight schools for certified professional midwives accredited by the Midwifery Education Accreditation Council.  None of these schools are located in Hawaii.  Limiting certification pathways to those that are prohibitively difficult for residents of Hawaii to pursue displaces Hawaii practitioners and limits patients' access to culturally informed, community-based care. Balancing equities by assuring access to licensure for Hawaii residents is important. The Hawaii Regulatory Licensing Reform Act, codified as chapter 26H, Hawaii Revised Statutes, requires the State to regulate professions only "when the health, safety, or welfare of the consumer may be jeopardized by the nature of the service".  The analysis must be based on "evidence of abuses by providers of the service" and other actual evidence to determine whether regulation is desirable. Chapter 26H also requires that any professional regulations "not unreasonably restrict entry into professions and vocations by all qualified persons."  The law notes that "the purpose of regulation shall be the protection of the public welfare and not that of the regulated profession or vocation".  The law also requires regulations to be eliminated "when the legislature determines that they have no further benefits to consumers". Based on this analysis, the legislature finds that the regulation of certified midwives and certified professional midwives, who utilize prescription drugs, modern instrumentations, and techniques such as intravenous fluid administration, is reasonable and beneficial to consumers; provided that additional pathways are made available for qualified local Hawaii practitioners to achieve licensure.  Regulation by the State of the birth practices of traditional and non-clinical practitioners and extended or hanai family members is not supported or required by the Hawaii Regulatory Licensing Reform Act. The legislature's intent is to allow a person to choose where and with whom they give birth by ensuring the legality of all practices used by any birthing person, while also building comprehensive solutions that address the complexity of community needs and cultural considerations in Hawaii. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Provide for the continued licensure of certified midwives and certified professional midwives by the department of commerce and consumer affairs; (2)  Identify the scope of practice for a licensed midwife, including the ability to provide independent midwifery services in hospitals, clinics, freestanding birthing facilities, community birthing settings, and the home; (3)  Clarify that the services of licensed midwives are eligible for insurance reimbursement; (4)  Prohibit persons from identifying as certified midwives or certified professional midwives, unless those persons are appropriately licensed; and (5)  Temporarily re-establish the home birth task force to provide additional recommendations on issues related to home births. PART II SECTION 2.  Section 26H-4, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§26H-4  Repeal dates for newly enacted professional and vocational regulatory programs.  [(a)] Any professional or vocational regulatory program enacted after January 1, 1994, and listed in this section shall be repealed as specified in this section.  The auditor shall perform an evaluation of the program, pursuant to section 26H-5, before its repeal date. [(b)  Chapter 457J (midwives) shall be repealed on June 30, 2025.]" SECTION 3.  Chapter 457J, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part   .  certified midwives and certified professional midwives §457J-A  Definitions.
