Section 1:
HB930 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 930 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT proposing an amendment to article x, section 1, of the constitution of the state of hawaii to require that the statewide public school system be thorough and Efficient. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that article X, section 1, of the Hawaii State Constitution requires the State to provide a system of public education but makes no mention of the quality of the education system that the State is obligated to provide. Compared to other states, Hawaii is unique because the State, rather than a county or local level jurisdiction, is responsible for public education.  While the United Nations has declared education to be a fundamental human right because a quality education is a critical asset for individuals and economies competing in today's globalized world, Hawaii struggles to provide a quality education to all keiki.  This struggle is evidenced by a teacher shortage that stands at one hundred sixty-six vacancies as of the start of the 2024-2025 school year and decaying school facilities. The legislature also finds that the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted inequalities existing within Hawaii's public education system, with socioeconomically disadvantaged communities and impoverished families often lacking the resources needed to participate in distance learning programs. Similarly, special education and high-needs students faced challenges in accessing the resources needed to support their educational progress.  While these problems were revealed by the COVID-19 pandemic, they reflect and exacerbate longstanding disparities in the State's public school system, including an ongoing teacher shortage, inadequate resources for special education and high‑needs children, deteriorating public school facilities, and a lack of culturally relevant education opportunities for native Hawaiian students. The purpose of this Act is to propose an amendment to article X, section 1, of the Hawaii State Constitution to require that the statewide public school system be thorough and efficient. SECTION 2.  Article X, section 1, of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii is amended to read as follows: "PUBLIC EDUCATION Section 1.  The State shall provide for the establishment, support and control of a thorough and efficient statewide system of public schools free from sectarian control, a state university, public libraries and such other educational institutions as may be deemed desirable, including physical facilities therefor.  There shall be no discrimination in public educational institutions because of race, religion, sex or ancestry; nor shall public funds be appropriated for the support or benefit of any sectarian or nonsectarian private educational institution, except that proceeds of special purpose revenue bonds authorized or issued under section 12 of Article VII may be appropriated to finance or assist: 1.  Not-for-profit corporations that provide early childhood education and care facilities serving the general public; and 2.  Not-for-profit private nonsectarian and sectarian elementary schools, secondary schools, colleges and universities." SECTION 3.  The question to be printed on the ballot shall be as follows: "Shall the Hawaii State Constitution be amended to require the statewide public school system to be thorough and efficient?" SECTION 4.  New constitutional material is underscored. SECTION 5.  This amendment shall take effect upon compliance with article XVII, section 3, of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: Education; Public School System; Constitutional Amendment Description: Proposes an amendment to article X, section 1, of the Hawaii State Constitution to require that the statewide public school system be thorough and efficient.
