Section 1:
SB523 SD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 523 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO AGRICULTURAL BIOSECURITY. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the spread of invasive species, such as axis deer and feral pigs, poses significant threats to Hawaii's agricultural viability, biosecurity, and ecosystems.  Local livestock and crop farms are particularly vulnerable to predation, crop damage, and disease transmission facilitated by these invasive species. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to require the department of agriculture to establish and administer a biosecurity fencing cost-sharing program to assist agricultural operations in constructing or upgrading fencing infrastructure to enhance biosecurity, mitigate invasive species impacts, and support agricultural production, while incentivizing the adoption of soil and water conservation district-approved conservation plans. SECTION 2. Chapter 141, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part I to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§141-    Biosecurity fencing cost-sharing program; reimbursement rates; eligibility; reporting; rules.  (a) The department shall establish and administer a biosecurity fencing cost-sharing program to provide financial assistance to eligible applicants for the installation, construction, repair, or improvement of agricultural fencing to enhance biosecurity, mitigate invasive species impacts, and protect agricultural productivity.
