BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the preservation of public safety and efficient flow of traffic are essential priorities in maintaining the well-being of the State's communities.  It is recognized that roadways and intersections serve as critical junctions for mobility and connectivity.  As streets are shared spaces, their proper use is fundamental to ensuring the safety of drivers, pedestrians, and all users of public thoroughfares.  Distracted driving has been identified as a leading cause of accidents and injuries, posing a significant risk to life and property, and creating disruptions that affect everyone in the State.

Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to prohibit any person from engaging in any activity that has the intent and effect of distracting drivers along streets, roadways, or other public property within one hundred feet of an intersection.
