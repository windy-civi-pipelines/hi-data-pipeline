STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO SEA SALT PRODUCTS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the popularity of
2 Hawaii-made sea salt products is on the rise. Sea salt products
3 colored with Hawaiian charcoal, volcanic clay, and other natural
4 ingredients help to promote the State's businesses.
5 The legislature further finds that incorporating the United
6 States Food and Drug Administration's industry guidance on the
7 use of color additives in sea salt products should be a state
8 priority. The guidance indicates that sea salt manufacturers
n
who intend to use color additives that are not currently
10 approved for food use should first obtain approval through the
11 United States Food and Drug Administration's color additive
12 petition process.
13 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to ensure the
14 continued viability of the State's sea salt manufacturing
15 industry by appropriating funds to provide education and support
16 to local businesses regarding the United States Food and Drug
17 Administration's guidance on colored sea salt.
