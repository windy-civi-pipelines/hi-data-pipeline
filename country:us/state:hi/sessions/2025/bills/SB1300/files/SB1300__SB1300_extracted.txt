Section 1:
SB1300 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1300 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to school meals. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii's working families face significant economic challenges, including the rising cost of living, inflation, and limited affordable options for basic needs.  Access to nutritious meals is essential for the overall well-being of Hawaii's people.  Further, for students, access to healthy meals is critical to academic success and achievement.  However, for some students, school meals may be their only consistent source of food. The legislature also finds that Aloha United Way released the asset limited, income constrained, employed (ALICE) report in January 2025, which identified that, while twelve per cent of households in the State are below the poverty line, twenty-nine per cent are identified as ALICE households.  ALICE households are defined as households with incomes above the federal poverty level but continue to struggle with the bare-minimum costs of basic necessities such as housing, childcare, food, transportation, health care, and a smartphone plan, plus taxes.  The report also finds that forty-six per cent of ALICE households experience consistent food insecurity. The legislature further finds that subsidizing the meal costs for ALICE households will have the benefit of providing support to families in need. Additionally, subsidized meal costs for students will allow students to focus on their academic careers, extracurricular activities, and life goals.  Meal subsidies at department of education schools will allow more students to achieve a high-quality education while ensuring adequate nutrition for physical development and mental well-being. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds to the department of education to subsidize meal costs for students whose families qualify as ALICE households. SECTION 2. There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $10,000,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 for meal subsidies for students at department of education schools whose families are classified as asset limited, income constrained, employed (ALICE) households. The sums appropriated shall be expended by the department of education for the purposes of this Act. SECTION 3. This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2025. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: DOE; ALICE; Meal Subsidies; Appropriations Description: Appropriates funds to the Department of Education for meal subsidies for students whose families is classified as asset limited, income constrained, employed (ALICE) households.
