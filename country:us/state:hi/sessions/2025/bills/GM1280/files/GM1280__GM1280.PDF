A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO THE CLASSIFICATION AND COMPENSATION SYSTEMS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that state agencies are
2 experiencing a significant labor shortage that is anticipated to
3 worsen in the future. According to the department of human
4 resources development, vacant positions within state agencies
5 increased from eighteen per cent in 2019 before the COVID-19
6 pandemic to twenty-seven per cent in 2023. While the COVID-19
7 pandemic may have contributed to this increase, the department
8 of human resources development also reported that thirty per
9 cent of existing state employees will be eligible for retirement
10 in the next five years.
11 The legislature also finds that the class specifications of
12 state positions that define the duties and responsibilities of
13 the respective class, level of difficulty and authority, and
14 minimum qualifications, and compensation for the positions have
15 become outdated, contributing to state agencies' struggle in
16 recruiting, hiring, and retaining employees. Therefore, it is
17 imperative for state departments and agencies to conduct a
