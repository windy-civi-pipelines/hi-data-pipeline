C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO THE COMMUNITY OUTREACH COURT.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the worsening
2 problem of homelessness on Oahu has led to residents being cited
3 or arrested for drinking liquor in public, being in public parks
4 after hours, trespassing, illegal camping on sidewalks and other
5 public areas, and other nonviolent or status offenses. Many of
6 those cited are unable to attend court or have misplaced their
7 paperwork due to the transient and unstable nature of
8 homelessness. When a person fails to appear for court and has
9 no known address, courts are left with no option but to issue a
10 bench warrant.
11 Under Act 55, Session Laws of Hawaii 2017, the judiciary,
12 office of the public defender, and department of the prosecuting
13 attorney of the city and county of Honolulu established a
14 community court outreach project. The goal of the community
15 court outreach project is to assist nonviolent offenders who are
16 charged with offenses that disproportionately impact the
17 homeless community by making court attendance more accessible

1 through holding court in community locations where offenders are
2 found, resolving any active charges, and utilizing alternative
3 sentences such as community service work in cases where prior
4 court judgments could not be satisfied and offenders lack the
5 present ability to pay fines and fees. By resolving these
6 cases, the participants are in a better position to obtain basic
7 necessities such as jobs, income assistance, and housing. The
8 community court outreach project social worker assesses
9 offenders for participation in programs deemed appropriate based
10 upon an offender's need for mental health services, substance
11 abuse treatment, sustenance, shelter, or other appropriate
12 available social services and assists the offenders in obtaining
13 and voluntarily participating in these referred services.
14 The legislature finds that the community court outreach
15 project has been successful. Since its inception, the project
16 has addressed over ten thousand cases, recalled over nine
17 hundred bench warrants, lifted more than seven thousand driver
18 license stoppers, and provided assistance to over six hundred
19 participants at community-based sites in the judicial districts
20 where participants may live or have access to mental health
21 services, substance abuse treatment, sustenance, shelter, or
