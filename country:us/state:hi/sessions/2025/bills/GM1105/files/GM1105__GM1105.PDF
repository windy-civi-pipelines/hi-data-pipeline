Dear President Kouchi, Speaker Nakamura, and Members of the Legislature:
This is to inform you that on April 10, 2025, the following bill was signed into law:
HB132 HD1 RELATING TO EXPUNGEMENT.
ACT 005

THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE. 2025 H K N Cj H.D. 1
STATE OF HAWAII ’ .
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO EXPUNGEMENT.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAH:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that Act 62, Session Laws
2 of Hawaii 2024 (Act 62), is a vital pilot project that provides
3 needed relief to hundreds of Hawaii residents with criminal
4 records related to possession of small amounts of cannabis.
5 Since the implementation of Act 62, the legislature finds that
6 the efficiency and effectiveness of the law will be greatly
7 improved through modification.
8 The purpose of this Act is to amend Act 62 to include
9 possession of a schedule V substance in any amount to the
10 charges that are eligible for expungement under the pilot
11 project.
12 SECTION 2. Act 62, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024, is amended
13 as follows:
14 1. By amending section 1 to read:
15 "SECTION 1. The legislature finds that approximately
16 seventy-seven million persons in the United States have a
17 criminal record. In some instances, the person was arrested but
2025-1286 HB132 HDl HMSO
Page 2 132
H.B. NO.
H.D. 1
1 ultimately not convicted of a crime. The legislature recognizes
2 that arrest records can adversely affect a person's financial
3 security and limit their ability to obtain housing, employment,
4 or a professional license.
5 The legislature also finds that in 2019, the legislature
6 passed Act 273, Session Laws of Hawaii 2019, which
7 decriminalized the possession of three grams or less of
8 marijuana. Despite the decriminalization, some persons still
9 have prior arrest records for related charges that affect their
10 employment and housing options. The legislature further
11 recognizes that many states, including Hawai'i, allow arrest
12 records to be expunged under certain circumstances. However,
13 these processes generally require an eligible person to navigate
14 the court system and pay court fees. According to the National
15 Conference of State Legislatures, at least twenty states have
16 developed state-initiated processes to expunge certain criminal
17 records at no cost to the record holder to ease the logistical
18 and financial barriers to receiving an expungement.
19 The legislature further finds that the Hawai'i criminal
20 justice data center is a division of the department of the
21 attorney general and is responsible for the statewide criminal
2025-1286 HB132 HDl HMSO

H.D. 1
1 history record information system and for processing expungement
2 orders pursuant to section 831-3.2, Hawaii Revised Statutes. To
3 expunge records relating to any offense, manual examination of
4 those records is required. As of March 10, 2024, there are over
5 fifty-thousand records with a charge code of section 712-1249,
6 Hawaii Revised Statutes, for promoting a detrimental drug in a
7 third degree, which involves possession of less than one ounce
8 of marijuana or less than one-eighth ounce (or less than fifty
9 tablets or capsules, as applicable) of any Schedule V substance.
10 Recognizing the limited resources of the Hawai'i criminal
11 justice data center, the purpose of this Act is to establish a
12 pilot project, to be administered by the department of the
13 attorney general, to expunge certain arrest records and other
14 records pertaining to prior arrests made under section 712-1249,
15 Hawaii Revised Statutes[7—concerning the poaacos4on of Icoo than
16 one ounce of marijuana]. For purposes of this pilot project,
17 the Hawai'i criminal justice data center will use existing
18 resources, without any additional appropriations, and will
19 report to the legislature on progress and lessons learned, which
20 can better inform future legislation concerning state-initiated
21 expungement."

12 (b) Notwithstanding section 831-3.2, Hawaii Revised

14 the attorney general shall issue, without any written
15 application by the holder of an arrest record and on the
16 department's own initiative, an expungement order annulling,
17 cancelling, and rescinding the arrest record where:
