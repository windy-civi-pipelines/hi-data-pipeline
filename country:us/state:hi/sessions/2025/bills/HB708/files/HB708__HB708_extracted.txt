Classification rates may be modified to produce rates for individual risks in accordance with rating plans which establish standards for measuring variations in hazards or expense provisions, or both.  The standards may measure any differences among risks that can be demonstrated to have a probable effect upon losses or expenses.

(b)  If, after a hearing conducted pursuant to subsection (a), the commissioner finds that the complainant is entitled to relief or that any classification, rule, standard, rate, rating territory, or rating plan violates this article, the commissioner shall issue an order granting the complainant's claim for relief or prohibiting the insurer from using such classification, rule, standard, rate, rating territory, or rating plan.  The order shall contain the commissioner's findings of fact and conclusions of law, including a specification of the respects in which a violation of this article exists and specifying a reasonable time period within which the insurer shall comply with the terms of the order.  Any such order shall be subject to judicial review in the manner provided in chapter 91. §431:   -204  Rate review: rate methods in noncompliance with article.  (a)  If the commissioner has good cause to believe that a classification, rule, standard, rate, rating territory, or rating plan made, followed, or adopted by an insurer does not comply with the requirements of this article, the commissioner shall, unless the commissioner has good cause to believe that such noncompliance is wilful, give notice in writing to each insurer, stating in what manner and to what extent such noncompliance is alleged to exist and specifying a reasonable time, not less than ten days thereafter, within which such noncompliance may be corrected.
