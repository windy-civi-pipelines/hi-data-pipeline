HB1409 CD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1409 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII S.D. 1 C.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1. The legislature finds that Hawaii faces a persistent housing crisis.  Demand for housing significantly outpaces supply, particularly in urban areas. Transit-oriented development districts present a critical opportunity for efficient land use by promoting higher-density development near public transit infrastructure, thereby maximizing the value of public investments.  Higher residential density in transit-oriented development districts increases public transit ridership, thus reducing dependency on private automobiles and lowering greenhouse gas emissions, which supports the State's climate resilience and sustainability objectives. The legislature established transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement districts to foster community development by strategically investing in infrastructure improvements through Act 184, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022. The legislature found that transit-oriented development promotes development patterns that enhance residents' quality of life; preserve the natural environment; provide a range of housing choices for residents; and encourage walking, biking, and the use of mass transit.  Furthermore, the legislature concluded that the State plays an important role in overcoming barriers to transit-oriented development by encouraging needed investments in improving regional infrastructure such as roads, sewers, power, communication, and storm water management systems. The legislature further recognizes that the ready availability of affordable workforce housing near transit hubs reduces transportation costs and improves access to employment, education, and other essential services, especially for low- and moderate-income households, thereby advancing social and economic equity for the people of Hawaii. The underutilization of land in transit-oriented development districts, due partially to restrictive development standards, undermines the economic and environmental benefits of state investments in county-designated transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement districts, contributes to urban sprawl, and increases infrastructure costs and environmental degradation. The legislature finds that numerous jurisdictions, including California, Oregon, and Washington, have adopted minimum density standards for transit-oriented developments, demonstrating the effectiveness of these measures in increasing housing supply while bolstering transit systems.  Transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement districts can increase residential density near transit hubs in order to foster vibrant, walkable communities; support local businesses; and generate higher property tax revenues, contributing to Hawaii's fiscal and economic vitality. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Temporarily establish the mixed-income subaccount within the rental housing revolving fund for five years to finance certain projects, including those located in transit-oriented developments; (2)  Require the transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement district board to consider the infrastructure needs of transit-supportive density requirements; and (3)  Require the strategic plan developed by the Hawaii interagency council for transit-oriented development to delineate transit-oriented development areas for each county. SECTION 2.  Section 201H-202, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§201H-202  Rental housing revolving fund.  (a) There is established the rental housing revolving fund to be administered by the corporation. (b) An amount from the fund, to be set by the corporation and authorized by the legislature, may be used for administrative expenses incurred by the corporation in administering the corporation's housing finance programs; provided that fund moneys shall not be used to finance day-to-day administrative expenses of projects allotted fund moneys.

(b)  Whenever the board determines to undertake, or causes to be undertaken, any infrastructure improvement as part of the program, the cost of providing the infrastructure improvement may be assessed against the real property in each district specially benefiting from the infrastructure improvement.  The board shall determine the areas of each district that will benefit from the infrastructure improvement to be undertaken, and if less than the entire district benefits, the board may establish assessment areas within the district.  The board may issue and sell bonds in amounts as may be authorized by the legislature to provide funds to finance the infrastructure improvements.  The board may fix the assessments against real property specially benefited.  All assessments made pursuant to this section shall be a statutory lien against each lot or parcel of land assessed from the date of the notice declaring the assessment until the assessment is paid, and the lien shall have priority over all other liens except the lien of property taxes.  As between liens of assessments, the earlier lien shall be superior to the later lien. (c)  Bonds issued to provide funds to finance transit-oriented development infrastructure improvements shall be secured solely by the real properties benefited or improved, the assessments thereon, or the revenues derived from the program for which the bonds are issued, including reserve accounts and earnings thereon, insurance proceeds, and other revenues, or any combination thereof. The bonds may be additionally secured by the pledge or assignment of loans and other agreements or any note or other undertaking, obligation, or property held by the board.  Bonds issued pursuant to this section and the income therefrom shall be exempt from all state and county taxation, except transfer and estate taxes.  The bonds shall be issued subject to rules adopted by the board pursuant to this section. (d)  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, in assessing real property for transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement, the board shall assess the real property within an assessment area according to the special benefits conferred upon the real property by the infrastructure improvement. These methods may include assessment on a frontage basis or according to the area of real property within an assessment area or any other assessment method that assesses the real property according to the special benefit conferred, or any combination thereof. No assessment levied against real property specially benefited as provided by this part shall constitute a tax on real property within the meanings of any constitutional or statutory provisions.  No assessment shall be levied against real property owned by the federal government, the State, or a county, or an agency thereof, without the prior written consent of the owner. (e)  The board shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to provide for the method of undertaking and financing transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement in an assessment area or an entire district.  The rules adopted pursuant to this section shall include but not be limited to: (1)  The methods by which the board shall establish assessment areas; (2)  The method of assessment of real properties specially benefited; (3)  The costs to be borne by the board, the county in which districts are situated, and the property owners; (4)  The procedures before the board relating to the creation of the assessment areas by the owners of real property therein, including provisions for petitions, bids, contracts, bonds, and notices; (5)  Provisions relating to assessments; (6)  Provisions relating to financing, including bonds, revolving funds, advances from available funds, special funds for payment of bonds, payment of principal and interest, and sale and use of the bonds; (7)  Provisions relating to funds and refunding of outstanding debts; (8)  Provisions relating to limitations on time to sue; and (9)  Other related provisions. (f)  Notwithstanding any other provisions to the contrary, the board may, in its discretion, enter into any agreement with the county in which the districts are located to implement all or part of the purposes of this section. (g)  All sums collected under this section shall be deposited into the transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement district special fund established under section 206E-247 and shall be applied solely to: (1)  The payment of the principal and interest on the bonds and the cost of administering, operating, and maintaining the program; (2)  The establishment of reserves; and (3)  Other purposes as may be authorized in the proceedings providing for the issuance of the bonds. If any surplus remains in the fund after the payment of the bonds chargeable against the fund, it shall be credited to and become a part of the fund. (h)  The transit-oriented development infrastructure improvements to be financed through bonds issued by the board may be dedicated to the county in which the infrastructure improvements are to be located.  The board shall ensure that the infrastructure improvements are designed and constructed to meet county requirements and shall enter into an agreement with the county for dedication of the public facilities. (i)  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, whenever it becomes necessary to remove, relocate, replace, or reconstruct public utility facilities that are part of a program, the board shall establish by rule the allocation of cost between the board, the affected public utilities, and the properties that may specially benefit from the improvement, if any.  In determining the allocation of cost, the board shall consider the cost allocation policies for districts established by the county in which the removal, relocation, replacement, or reconstruction is to take place.
