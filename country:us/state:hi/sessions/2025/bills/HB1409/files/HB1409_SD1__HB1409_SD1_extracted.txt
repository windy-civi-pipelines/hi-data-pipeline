HB1409 SD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1409 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII S.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1. The legislature finds that Hawaii faces a persistent housing crisis.  Demand for housing significantly outpaces supply, particularly in urban areas. Transit-oriented development districts present a critical opportunity for efficient land use by promoting higher-density development near public transit infrastructure, thereby maximizing the value of public investments.  Higher residential density in transit-oriented development districts increases public transit ridership, thus reducing dependency on private automobiles and lowering greenhouse gas emissions, which supports the State's climate resilience and sustainability objectives. The legislature established transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement districts to foster community development by strategically investing in infrastructure improvements through Act 184, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022. The legislature found that transit-oriented development promotes development patterns that enhance residents' quality of life; preserve the natural environment; provide a range of housing choices for residents; and encourage walking, biking, and the use of mass transit.  Furthermore, the legislature concluded that the State plays an important role in overcoming barriers to transit-oriented development by encouraging needed investments in improving regional infrastructure such as roads, sewers, power, communication, and storm water management systems. The legislature further recognizes that the ready availability of affordable workforce housing near transit hubs reduces transportation costs and improves access to employment, education, and other essential services, especially for low- and moderate-income households, thereby advancing social and economic equity for the people of Hawaii. The underutilization of land in transit-oriented development districts, due partially to restrictive development standards, undermines the economic and environmental benefits of state investments in county-designated transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement districts, contributes to urban sprawl, and increases infrastructure costs and environmental degradation. The legislature finds that numerous jurisdictions, including California, Oregon, and Washington, have adopted minimum density standards for transit-oriented developments, demonstrating the effectiveness of these measures in increasing housing supply while bolstering transit systems.  Transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement districts can increase residential density near transit hubs in order to foster vibrant, walkable communities; support local businesses; and generate higher property tax revenues, contributing to Hawaii's fiscal and economic vitality. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Amend the funding priorities of the rental housing revolving fund to incentivize development in areas that satisfy transit-supportive density requirements; (2)  Allocate a minimum percentage of the rental housing revolving fund for certain mixed-income rental housing projects; (3)  Require the transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement district board to consider the infrastructure needs of transit-supportive density requirements; and (4)  Require the strategic plan developed by the Hawaii interagency council for transit-oriented development to delineate transit-oriented development areas for each county. SECTION 2.  Section 201H-202, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§201H-202  Rental housing revolving fund.  (a) There is established the rental housing revolving fund to be administered by the corporation. (b) An amount from the fund, to be set by the corporation and authorized by the legislature, may be used for administrative expenses incurred by the corporation in administering the corporation's housing finance programs; provided that fund moneys shall not be used to finance day-to-day administrative expenses of projects allotted fund moneys.

(e) Moneys available in the fund shall be used for the purpose of providing, in whole or in part, loans for rental housing projects demonstrating project readiness, efficiency, and feasibility acceptable to the corporation in the following order of priority: (1)  For projects that were awarded low-income housing credits pursuant to paragraph (2), priority shall be given to projects with a perpetual affordability commitment; (2)  Projects or units in projects that are allocated low-income housing credits pursuant to the state housing credit ceiling under section 42(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or projects or units in projects that are funded by programs of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and United States Department of Agriculture Rural Development wherein: (A)  At least fifty per cent of the available units are for persons and families with incomes at or below eighty per cent of the median family income of which at least five per cent of the available units are for persons and families with incomes at or below thirty per cent of the median family income; and (B)  The remaining units are for persons and families with incomes at or below one hundred per cent of the median family income; provided that the corporation may establish rules to ensure full occupancy of fund projects; [and] (3)  Mixed-income rental projects or units in a mixed-income rental project in an area that satisfies: (A)  Transit-supportive density requirements; and (B)  Standards for project readiness, efficiency, and feasibility, wherein all of the available units are for persons and families with incomes at or below one hundred forty per cent of the median family income[.]; and (4)  Mixed-income rental projects or units in a mixed-income rental project wherein all of the available units are for persons and families with incomes at or below one hundred forty per cent of the median family income.
