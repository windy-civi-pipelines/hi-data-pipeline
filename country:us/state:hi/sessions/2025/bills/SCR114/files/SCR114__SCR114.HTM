SCR114 THE SENATE S.C.R. NO. 114 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION Requesting the Department of Education, in collaboration with the Department of Health and State Public Charter School Commission, to conduct a study on the practices of managing heat exposure in department and charter schools to protect students' health during outdoor activities. WHEREAS, Hawaii has experienced rising air temperatures, with annual peak averages consistently breaking record highs; and WHEREAS, these increases, along with Hawaii's high average annual relative humidity, pose significant challenges for human thermoregulation; and WHEREAS, exercising in hot and humid weather can be dangerous, as the body's ability to cool itself through sweating becomes less effective under humid conditions; and WHEREAS, when sweat cannot evaporate efficiently due to high moisture levels in the air, the risk of heat-related illnesses increases; and WHEREAS, children and younger athletes are particularly vulnerable to exertional heat illness due to slower heat acclimatization, reduced thermoregulation capabilities compared to adults, and external pressures from coaches and parents to exceed their physical limits; and WHEREAS, additionally, children often lack control over the timing and conditions of outdoor activities, such as recess and individual or team practices, and may have limited access to hydration during these activities; and WHEREAS, shade can significantly reduce the risk of heat-related illnesses by providing cooler spaces for students to exercise, train, and play; and WHEREAS, expanding shaded areas on school campuses and properties is critical for creating safer environments during outdoor activities; and WHEREAS, identifying and developing areas on campuses to increase shade access is an essential strategy for protecting children from dangerous levels of heat; and WHEREAS, wet-bulb globe temperature measurements are the gold standard for assessing heat stress, as adopted by organizations such as the United States military, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, National Collegiate Athletic Association, and professional sports leagues; and WHEREAS, wet-bulb globe thermometers are also relatively affordable for schools and athletic departments to acquire and use, making them a practical tool for ensuring safer outdoor activities; and WHEREAS, despite these known challenges and expected increasing temperatures, Hawaii currently lacks statewide guidelines for managing extreme heat during outdoor recreational activities, leaving children at risk of preventable heat-related illnesses; and WHEREAS, an in-depth study is necessary to determine the best practices for managing heat exposure and to develop a plan if the existing practices are insufficient in ensuring student safety from heat exposure; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, the House of Representatives concurring, that the Department of Education, in collaboration with the Department of Health and State Public Charter School Commission, is requested to conduct a study on the practices of managing heat exposure in department and charter schools to protect students' health during outdoor activities; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that in its study, the Department of Education is requested to look at the feasibility of using a wet bulb globe temperature as a standard for measuring heat stress; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that if the Department of Education determines that the existing practices are insufficient in safeguarding the well-being of students from heat exposure in the course of conducting the study, the Department is requested to develop a plan that includes guidelines for managing heat exposure to protect students' health during outdoor activities; provided that the guidelines: (1)  Apply to all department and charter schools in the State; (2)  Be utilized for sports practices, conditioning workouts, recess, marching band practice, junior reserve officers' training corps activities, and other outdoor activities; (3)  Include protocols for ensuring adequate hydration during outdoor activities; (4)  Include training for school staff on recognizing and responding to symptoms of exertional heat illness; (5)  Include measures to safeguard students with medical conditions or medications that impair thermoregulation; and (6)  Include recommendations for acclimatizing or re-acclimatizing students returning to outdoor activities after a period of absence; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of Education is requested to assess the ongoing cost of guideline implementation and continued maintenance and include the assessment in the Department's study; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of Education is requested to submit the study, including any findings, recommendations, and proposed legislation, to the Legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2026; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should a plan be developed by the Department of Education, the Department is requested to complete and submit the plan to the Legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2027; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to Superintendent of Education, Director of Health, and Chairperson of the State Public Charter School Commission.
