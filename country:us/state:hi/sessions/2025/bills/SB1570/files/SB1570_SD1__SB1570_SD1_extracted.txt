Section 1:
SB1570 SD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1570 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that since January 2021, only one passenger airline, Mokulele Airlines, has provided service to the general public out of Molokai airport.  Molokai is a small, rural island, and its residents rely on air service for essential travel, including work, medical appointments, and family visits. Any disruption of service by Mokulele Airlines leaves residents stranded without any other air service for essential travel. The legislature further finds that there has been urgent and growing concern regarding ongoing issues with Mokulele Airlines, including frequent delays and cancellations, which are forcing residents to resort to unsafe, makeshift transportation options.  In one recent example, Mokulele Airlines grounded its fleet and operations on Molokai on January 15, 2025.  As a result, one resident shared how she and others resorted to renting a boat at 4:00 a.m. to return home and transport medications to Molokai.  The same boat later transported another resident with a punctured lung on a grueling three-hour trip to Honolulu for emergency care. Other residents resorted to renting boats to reach Maui, driving from Lahaina to Kahului, and paying additional money for Hawaiian Airlines flights to Honolulu, and repeated the process in reverse to return.  School sports teams also endured three-hour boat rides to participate in tournaments on Oahu.  These examples highlight the severity and unacceptability of the situation. The legislature believes that Mokulele Airlines' unreliability and the lack of alternative air carrier options put lives and livelihoods at risk. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to require the department of transportation to plan and design an expansion of the runway at Molokai airport to accommodate larger aircraft. SECTION 2. The department of transportation shall develop a plan and design to expand the runway at Molokai airport to accommodate the landing of larger aircraft.  As part of the plan, the department shall identify and analyze the most efficient construction technologies available for expedient runway expansion. The department of transportation shall submit the plan and a report of its findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 2026. SECTION 3. There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 for the planning and design of the expansion of the Molokai airport runway, pursuant to this Act. The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of transportation for the purposes of this Act. SECTION 4. This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2077. Report Title: DOT; Molokai Airport Runway Expansion; Report to Legislature; Appropriation Description: Requires the Department of Transportation to plan and design an expansion of the runway at Molokai Airport to accommodate larger aircraft.  Requires the Department of Transportation to submit a report to the Legislature. Appropriates funds.  Effective 7/1/2077.  (SD1) The summary description of legislation appearing on this page is for informational purposes only and is not legislation or evidence of legislative intent.
