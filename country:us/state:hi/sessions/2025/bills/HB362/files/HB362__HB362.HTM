BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Act 307, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022, conveyed to the department of education fee simple title to land that was used by the department of education that had previously been held by the State, department of land and natural resources, and the counties of Kauai and Maui.  Included in the land transfer was a tennis court owned by the county of Kauai that is adjacent to Wilcox elementary school in the county of Kauai.
