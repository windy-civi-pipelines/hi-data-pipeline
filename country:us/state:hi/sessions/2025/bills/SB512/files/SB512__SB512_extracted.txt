SB512 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 512 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO FIREFIGHTING. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii's unique status as an island state, positioned thousands of miles away from the nearest continent, makes addressing wildfires challenging.  For example, while other states may request assistance from out‑of‑state firefighting agencies under mutual aid agreements, Hawaii's isolation makes it difficult to request similar assistance.  The fact that each major Hawaiian island has its own unique geography, terrain, and resources further compounds challenges that firefighters face.  The legislature further finds that, because the threat of wildfires has increased in recent decades, the State must adapt its firefighting approaches to meet this threat. The legislature also finds that aerial firefighting is critical for rapid initial attack strategies, where every minute counts.  Studies have shown that swift aerial intervention can significantly reduce the extent of wildfire damage.  According to the National Wildfire Coordinating Group, responding to wildfires within the first hour can decrease the likelihood of large-scale spread by over seventy per cent.  Helicopters can drop water or fire retardants directly onto the fire, often reaching areas inaccessible to ground crews, thus preventing small fires from escalating. The legislature believes that the adoption of a unified, state‑driven approach to firefighting would enhance fire safety throughout the State.  In particular, the establishment of a dedicated statewide firefighting helicopter program is imperative for the State to fortify resilience against wildfires, enhance emergency response capabilities, and safeguard the well‑being of residents and visitors.  Although the individual counties currently operate firefighting helicopters, these resources are limited and are difficult to quickly deploy outside of a county in times of an emergency.  A dedicated statewide firefighting helicopter program equipped with appropriate technical capabilities and material resources will significantly reduce response times, enabling rapid deployment to contain wildfires in their early stages.  In addition, helicopters can be strategically placed to support county fire departments in times of need.  For example, helicopters may be proactively stationed near areas under red flag warnings. The importance of helicopters in wildfire response cannot be understated.  Hawaii's geography includes densely forested regions, arid landscapes, steep cliffs, and remote valleys, all of which present formidable challenges for ground-based firefighting efforts.  Rapid intervention and precision firefighting are often hindered by difficulties in accessing certain parts of the State.  A helicopter's ability to reach remote and inaccessible areas greatly increases firefighting capabilities and increases the chance that a fire can be brought under control early, before the fire spreads and destroys human life, communities, ecosystems, and critical infrastructure. Equipped with state-of-the-art technology, helicopters can deliver targeted water drops, fire retardant, and other firefighting agents with precision, maximizing the effectiveness of suppression efforts.  A dedicated statewide firefighting helicopter program will enhance monitoring capabilities, enable coordinating efforts, and promote the strategic allocation of assets, tools, and resources.  This capability is critical for minimizing the impact of wildfires on the environment and safeguarding natural resources. A helicopter's agility and versatility empower firefighting crews to adapt quickly to evolving fire dynamics, ensuring a more proactive and strategic approach to containment.  In particular, the legislature notes the important role that Hawaii army national guard helicopters played in responding to wildfires on the islands of Hawaii, Maui, and Oahu in 2023. The legislature further finds that, beyond firefighting, helicopters are versatile platforms that can respond to many emergencies besides wildfires. Helicopters purchased for firefighting are also essential tools in human and cargo transport, fire recognizance, search and rescue operations, and law enforcement missions.  Helicopters can also help areas burned by wildfires recover by aiding in re-seeding, thereby preventing erosion and runoff.  In particular, the ability of helicopters to access challenging terrains in remote areas make them invaluable assets in locating and extracting individuals in distress.  Hawaii's reliance on tourism and outdoor recreational activities on land and in the ocean underscores the importance of having helicopters available to perform search and rescue operations. The legislature also finds that other states have successfully implemented helicopter programs that demonstrate their efficacy.  During the 2021 Oregon wildfire season, helicopters played a pivotal role in suppressing fires that threatened urban areas.  The State's aerial resources, including helicopters, contributed to a ninety per cent success rate in initial fire containment efforts.  Similar programs in Colorado and California have consistently shown that timely aerial interventions can significantly improve fire management outcomes. The legislature notes that although the initial investment in a statewide firefighting helicopter program may seem high, the long-term savings are considerable. The National Interagency Fire Center reports that the cost of managing a wildfire can exceed $50,000 per acre once it spreads beyond initial control.  Conversely, an effective aerial response can contain a fire at a fraction of that cost, potentially saving millions in recovery efforts and property damage.  A study from California's Department of Forestry and Fire Protection indicated that the use of aerial resources during the 2020 wildfire season resulted in a cost savings of approximately $250,000,000. In summary, the legislature finds that the allocation of funding to create a dedicated statewide firefighting helicopter program is imperative to fortify Hawaii's resilience against the growing threat of wildfires, enhance overall emergency response capabilities, and safeguard the well-being of residents and visitors. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to require the state fire marshal to establish a statewide firefighting helicopter program and appropriate moneys. SECTION 2.  Chapter 132, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§132-    Statewide firefighting helicopter program agreements; reimbursement rates.  (a) The state fire marshal shall establish a statewide firefighting helicopter program.  For the purposes of this program, the state fire marshal shall: (1)  Purchase, acquire, lease, or contract for the provision of firefighting helicopters, facilities, equipment, drones, and supplies; (2)  Retrofit, maintain, staff, operate, and support firefighting helicopters or contract for the provision of these services; and (3)  Enter into agreements with state and county fire departments and emergency management agencies to establish policies and procedures for the deployment of firefighting helicopters. (b)  The state fire marshal may: (1)  Enter into agreements with federal, state, or county agencies for the provision of the state fire marshal's firefighting helicopters when the state fire marshal is not utilizing the helicopters; and (2)  Establish reimbursement rates for the direct and indirect costs of providing firefighting helicopters and firefighting services." SECTION 3. There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the state fire marshal to: (1)  Purchase, acquire, lease, or contract for the provision of firefighting helicopters, facilities, equipment, drones, and supplies; (2)  Establish permanent, full-time equivalent (      FTE) positions to administer the statewide firefighting helicopter program, including staff to operate and maintain firefighting aircraft and equipment; (3)  Provide necessary staff training; and (4)  Do other things necessary to ensure that the statewide firefighting helicopter program is ready to begin providing aerial firefighting services on July 1, 2026. The sums appropriated shall be expended by the department of labor and industrial relations for the purposes of this Act. SECTION 4. New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 5.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2025. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: State Fire Marshal; Statewide Firefighting Helicopter Program; Appropriations Description: Requires the State Fire Marshal to establish a Statewide Firefighting Helicopter Program. Appropriates funds for the State Fire Marshal to obtain helicopters, facilities equipment, drones, and supplies; hire and train staff; and do other things necessary to ensure that the Program is ready to begin providing aerial firefighting services on 7/1/2026.
