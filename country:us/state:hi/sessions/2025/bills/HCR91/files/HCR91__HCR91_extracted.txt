NO. 91 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION requesting health insurers and managed care providers that provide health insurance in the State to provide insurance coverage for prosthetic and orthotic devices. WHEREAS, there are more than 18,000 Hawaii residents living with limb loss, limb difference, and mobility impairments who face significant barriers to participating in physical activities, essential daily functions, and recreational opportunities due to outdated and discriminatory insurance coverage and policies that routinely deny access to essential activity-specific prosthetic and orthotic devices; and WHEREAS, individuals with limb loss and limb differences in Hawaii must often rely on a single prosthetic or orthotic device, which is typically designed for limited mobility and does not accommodate activities such as running, cycling, swimming, or bathing, creating unnecessary risks of injury, preventable health conditions, and diminished quality of life; and WHEREAS, the denial of essential activity-specific devices perpetuates inequities in health, independence, and economic opportunity for individuals with disabilities in Hawaii, forcing many to bear prohibitive out-of-pocket costs or forgo these necessary tools entirely; and WHEREAS, comprehensive insurance coverage for prosthetic and orthotic devices is critical to reducing the prevalence of preventable secondary health conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity, which disproportionately affect individuals with disabilities; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, the Senate concurring, that health insurers and managed care providers that provide health insurance in the State are requested to provide insurance coverage for prosthetic and orthotic devices; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Insurance Commissioner, Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer of Hawaii Medical Assurance Association, President and Chief Executive Officer of Hawaii Medical Service Association, President of Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and Hospitals Hawaii, Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Hawaii, President and Chief Executive Officer of University Health Alliance, Chief Executive Officer of AlohaCare, and Plan President and Chief Executive Officer of ʻOhana Health Plan.
