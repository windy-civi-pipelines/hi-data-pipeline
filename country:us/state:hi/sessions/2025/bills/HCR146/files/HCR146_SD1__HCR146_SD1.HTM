WHEREAS, many low-income households struggle to purchase food due to Hawaii's high cost of living and food prices; and WHEREAS, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as the Food Stamp Program, is crucial to providing necessary food assistance to some of Hawaii's most economically disadvantaged residents; and WHEREAS, in Hawaii, SNAP supports over one hundred thirty thousand individuals, bringing more than $630,000,000 into the State's economy each year; and WHEREAS, these benefits help economically vulnerable households meet their basic nutritional needs without sacrificing their financial security; and WHEREAS, the Elderly Simplified Application Project (ESAP) is a demonstration project designed to boost SNAP enrollment among low-income older adults ages sixty years or older by tackling barriers to participation in SNAP; and WHEREAS, ESAP enhances program efficiency, simplifies benefit delivery by streamlining the application and certification processes, waives the recertification interview requirement, allows for greater flexibility in verification, and extends the certification period to thirty-six months; and WHEREAS, ESAP largely applies to households made up entirely of older adults with no earned income, although certain projects also include adults with disabilities who have no earned income or allow children to be present in the household, under certain conditions; and WHEREAS, Hawaii does not participate in ESAP; and WHEREAS, if Hawaii were to participate in ESAP, older adults in the State would face fewer barriers to accessing SNAP benefits, which could lead to increased enrollment among low‑income seniors and an improvement to overall food security and health outcomes; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, the Senate concurring, that the Department of Human Services is requested to apply for and implement the Elderly Simplified Application Project in the State when capable; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of Human Services is requested to seek any necessary federal approvals or waivers to implement the Elderly Simplified Application Project in the State, including amending its rules, policies, and procedures; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a certified copy of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Director of Human Services.
