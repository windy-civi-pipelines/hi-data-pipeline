STATE OF HAWAII
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO VEHICLE TITLE TRANSFERS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that when an automobile
2 transfer is made in the State and title is transferred from an
3 owner to a buyer, the transfer is not considered complete until
4 the county receives certain documentation from the vehicle's new
5 owner, the transferee. Until that occurs, the vehicle remains
6 legally registered to the original owner, the transferor. As a
7 result, the transferor may be liable for parking tickets,
8 traffic infractions, and other civil or criminal liabilities
9 even though the transferor no longer retains possession of the
10 vehicle. Meanwhile, the transferee will not be held legally or
11 financially responsible for violations arising out of the
12 transferee's operation of the vehicle. This situation is unfair
13 and frustrating for transferors, and ripe for abuse and
14 exploitation by transferees. Years' worth of news reports,
15 including a July 2024 article in the Honolulu Star-Advertiser,
16 demonstrate that this problem continually plagues motorists.

S.B. NO.
1 The legislation further finds that the State's vehicle
2 title transfer law already includes language establishing that
3 when a transferor complies with the portions of the statute
4 applying to transferors, the transferor is released from
5 liability arising out of the operation of the transferred motor
6 vehicle. Despite this provision, transferors continue to incur
7 liability. Other states, such as Texas, have addressed this
8 issue by inserting statutory language that clarifies the steps a
9 transferor can take to avoid such liability.
10 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
11 (1) Clarify that proof that a transferor has filed
12 required notice forms with the county director of
13 finance serves as a complete defense to any action
14 brought against the transferor for an act or omission,
15 civil or criminal, arising from the use, operation, or
16 abandonment of the vehicle by another person; and
17 (2) Require, by July 1, 2026, the judiciary to determine
18 whether new forms or modification of the judiciary's
19 website is necessary to assist vehicle transferors
20 and, if so, to create the forms or modify the website.

1 SECTION 2. Section 286-52, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
2 amended to read as follows:
3 "§286-52 Procedure when title or interest of vehicle
4 transferred; delivery of certificate mandatory[—]; complete
5 defense. (a) Upon a transfer of the title or interest of a
6 legal owner in or to a vehicle registered under this part, the
7 person whose title or interest is to be transferred and the
8 transferee shall write their signatures with pen and ink upon
9 the certificate of ownership issued for the vehicle, together
10 with the addresses of the person whose title or interest is to
11 be transferred and the transferee in the appropriate spaces
12 provided upon the certificate. The signature of the person
13 whose title or interest is to be transferred and signature of
14 the transferee shall each serve as an attestation by that
15 respective party that the information provided on the
16 certificate is correct. Any person who provides false or
17 fraudulent information under this subsection shall be fined no
18 less than $500 and no more than $1,000.
19 (b) Within thirty calendar days thereafter, the transferee

4 of finance shall charge a fee of $50, in addition to the fee
5 provided in section 286-51, for a new certificate of ownership.
6 (c) Subsection (b), requiring a transferee to forward the
7 certificate of ownership after endorsement to the director of
8 finance, shall not apply to the transferee of a vehicle who was
9 not intending to and does not drive the vehicle or permit the

11 transferee, upon transferring the transferee's interest or title
12 to another, shall give notice of the transfer to the director of
13 finance and endorse the certificate of ownership to the new
14 legal owner and the certificate of registration to the new
15 owner. If the director of finance has ascertained as of the

19 parking in violation of traffic ordinances within the county or

3 condition precedent to the transfer, that the registered owner
4 deposit or pay bail with respect to the summons or citations or
5 pay all outstanding charges and fines relating to the
6 disposition of the abandoned vehicle; provided that payment of
7 all outstanding charges and fines relating to the disposition of
8 the abandoned vehicle shall not be a condition precedent to the
9 transfer if the abandoned vehicle was stolen or taken from the
10 registered owner without permission or authorization and a
11 police report for the abandoned vehicle is filed within a period
12 of time, to be determined by the director of finance of each
13 county, after discovery of the abandoned vehicle.
14 (d) The director of finance[—] shall, upon receipt of the

1 (e) Until the director of finance has issued the new
2 certificate of registration and certificate of ownership as
3 provided in subsection (d) [pf^©v4^e^] , delivery of the vehicle

8 Code; provided that a security interest in a motor vehicle shall

5 referred to shall file with the director of finance a notice of
6 any transfer by sale, lease, or otherwise by the person, of the
7 vehicle, together with evidence satisfactory to the director of
