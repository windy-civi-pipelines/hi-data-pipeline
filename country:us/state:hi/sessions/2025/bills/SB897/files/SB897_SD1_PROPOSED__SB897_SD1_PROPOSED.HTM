1.  The legislature finds that it is imperative to enable the development of affordable
clean energy resources for the benefit of utility customers in the State.  Many
existing generating units in Hawaii will need to be retired in the next few
years due to obsolescence and environmental permitting requirements.  The
impending retirement of these units makes it urgent to obtain replacement
resources, without which the reliability of electrical supplies in the State
will be at risk.  In addition, continued reliance on these aging units, even if
feasible, would result in increased costs for utility customers and continued
reliance on fossil fuels, contrary to the State's policy to transition to
renewable, non-carbon-emitting resources.</a></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The procurement of replacement clean energy
resources by a certain investor-owned electric utility and its electric utility
subsidiaries is ongoing in its stage 3 request for proposals and further
anticipated in its first integrated grid planning request for proposals.  These
requests for proposals implement energy plans that are developed through
extensive engagement with local stakeholders and communities and reviewed and
approved by the public utilities commission.  The legislature finds that
successful procurement of clean energy resources is in the public interest and
necessary to avoid significant detrimental reliability and affordability
impacts to electric utility customers.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature also finds that the development
of clean energy resources by independent power producers is essential to
achieve the State's goals of one hundred per cent net electricity sales from
renewable sources by 2045, a zero emissions economy by 2045, and greater energy
security and energy diversification, as established by the Hawaii state
planning act and existing public utility laws.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature further finds that continued
development of clean energy resources requires adequate assurances to
independent power producers that prompt and full payments for purchased power
will be made, irrespective of the financial strength of an electric utility. 
The current sub investment grade status of a certain investor-owned electric
utility and its subsidiaries, arising from the tragic events that occurred in
the 2023 Maui wildfires, has led independent power producers, and those who
would finance renewable energy projects, to raise concerns about the
reliability of payment by the utility and its subsidiaries under new power
purchase agreements.  Those concerns may cause independent power producers to
cancel renewable energy projects or increase the prices they would charge for
deliveries to address this perceived credit risk.  Either outcome would be
contrary to the interests of electric utility customers in the State.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature therefore finds that the risk
for independent power producers could be mitigated by requiring the Hawaii
electricity reliability administrator to collect and administer funds to be
held for the benefit of independent power producers.  </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Require the public utilities commission to:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          (A)  Contract for a Hawaii electricity
reliability administrator; and</p>

reliability surcharge;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Establish the wildfire recovery fund; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Expand the powers and duties of the Hawaii
electricity reliability administrator.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§269-C</b>  <b>Eligibility for participation
as a contributor; contributions.</b>  (a)  To be eligible to participate as a
contributor, a person or entity shall:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Be a public utility that has a wildfire risk
mitigation plan that has been approved or accepted by the commission;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Notify the executive director, in the year before
the person or entity becomes a contributor, that it intends to participate in
the fund; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Agree to make an initial contribution, the
payment of which shall be a binding commitment enforceable by the executive
director.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The initial contributions from
investor-owned electric utilities collectively shall be:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  $1,000,000,000 plus interest as provided in
subsection&nbsp;(c) for amounts not securitized, which amounts shall be
recovered from its customers in nonbypassable rates; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  $500,000,000, which amount shall be funded by
shareholders of those investor-owned electric utilities and used exclusively
for the payment of salaries of the executive director and of all other persons

remaining as of 2035 to be transferred to the fund.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  An investor-owned electric utility may
elect to make the initial contribution set forth in subsection (b)(1), to the
degree not paid for through securitization, over a period not to exceed five
years; provided that interest shall be added to any amounts paid after the
first year, at an interest rate equal to the investor-owned electric utility's
incremental cost of long&#8209;term debt, with the interest recovered from
customers in rates.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  The executive director shall determine the
initial contributions from other public utilities based on an actuarial
assessment of the risk of potential payments by the fund resulting from covered
catastrophic wildfires created by a public utility.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The executive director may propose
supplemental contributions to the fund by participating public utilities,
independent power producers, or other entities involved in transmitting or
distributing electric energy for sale to the public.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  If a contributor fails to pay any part of
an initial contribution or a supplemental contribution that the contributor
agreed to make, or elects not to agree to make a supplemental contribution,
that contributor shall no longer be a contributor as of the date on which the
payment was due, and the contributor shall not receive any refund of payments
previously made; provided that a contributor that elects not to make a
supplemental contribution shall be a contributor as to any catastrophic
wildfire that occurs before the election date.  After failing to, or electing
not to, make a payment, a public utility may rejoin the fund as a contributor
on a prospective basis if the public utility makes owed payments with interest.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  The executive director shall adopt rules
pursuant to chapter 91 regarding the timing of initial and supplemental
contributions, which may include upfront, annual, and retrospective payments, including
payments made after a wildfire occurs.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§269-D</b>  <b>Determination of a covered
catastrophic wildfire.</b>  The executive director shall adopt rules pursuant
to chapter 91 regarding how to determine whether a wildfire is a covered
catastrophic wildfire.  The rules shall include a requirement that a wildfire
shall be determined to be a covered catastrophic wildfire if a party makes
non-frivolous allegations in a legal action that a contributor's facilities
caused or contributed to the severity of a catastrophic wildfire.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§269-E  Replenishment of the wildfire
recovery fund.</b>  (a) If the fund has made payments with respect to a covered
catastrophic wildfire and after resolution of substantially all third-party
liability claims that were brought or could be brought against contributors
arising from that covered catastrophic wildfire, each contributor whose
facilities were implicated in the covered catastrophic wildfire shall initiate
a proceeding before the commission to review the prudence of the public
utility's conduct leading to the catastrophic wildfire.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The commission shall determine whether the
contributor acted prudently by:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Considering only acts that may have caused the
occurrence or contributed to the severity of the covered catastrophic wildfire;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Evaluating the contributor's actions in the
context of its overall systems, processes, and programs;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Considering the recommendations of the executive
director concerning the priority of wildfire risk mitigation capital
expenditures, and the timeliness of contributor response; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Preventing a finding that any contributor action
was prudent if it meets the standard of gross negligence.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  If the commission determines that
imprudent conduct by the contributor caused the occurrence or contributed to
the severity of a covered catastrophic wildfire, the commission shall determine
whether to order the contributor to replenish the fund in whole or in part for
payments from the fund in connection with the catastrophic wildfire.  In
determining the amount of replenishment, if any, the commission shall consider
the extent and severity of the contributor's imprudence and factors within and
beyond the contributor's control that may have led to or exacerbated the costs
from the covered catastrophic wildfire, including but not limited to humidity,
temperature, winds, fuel, merged wildfires with independent ignitions,
third-party actions that affected the spread of the wildfire, and fire
suppression activities.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  For wildfire risk mitigation capital
expenditures made by the executive director, the commission may determine
whether to order the contributor to replenish the fund in whole or in part for
payments from the fund in connection with the wildfire risk mitigation capital
expenditures.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Over any three-year period, the commission
shall not order the contributor to reimburse the fund in an amount that exceeds
twenty per cent of the contributor's transmission and distribution equity rate
base.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  A contributor shall not recover in
regulated rates any amount that the commission orders the contributor to pay to
the fund as a replenishment under this section.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§269-F  Claims for payment by qualified
claimants;  presentment requirement; wildfire risk mitigation capital
expenditures by executive director.</b>  (a)  The executive director shall
adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to create a process:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Through which a qualified claimant that is not a
government entity may submit to the fund a claim for payment of economic
damages arising out of property damage resulting from a covered catastrophic
wildfire, including a deadline to submit claims; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  By which the executive director can use the fund
to make wildfire risk mitigation capital expenditures.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  A qualified claimant shall file a claim
for payment for economic damages arising out of the loss of or damage to real
or personal property from a covered catastrophic wildfire pursuant to this
section.  The claim of a qualified claimant that is not a property insurer
shall be limited to uninsured economic damages.  A qualified claimant shall not
file or maintain a civil action against a contributor unless and until the
qualified claimant rejects an offer of settlement from the fund.   A qualified
claimant who fails to file a claim by the deadline established by the executive
director pursuant to rule shall be ineligible to receive payment from the fund
and shall be barred from instituting or maintaining any qualifying action
against a contributor.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The executive director shall make an offer
to settle each claim submitted, which the claimant may accept or reject.  In
determining the amount of each offer, the executive director shall consider, at
a minimum:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The economic damages sought by all qualified
claimants in the aggregate;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The amount available to the fund relative to the
amount under paragraph (1);</p>

liability; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  The weight of any evidence of involvement of non&#8209;contributor
third-parties.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  If the amount available to the fund,
including assets held by the fund and all payments contributors are obligated
to make to the fund, is less than fifty per cent of the aggregate liability
limit as calculated in section 269-H, the fund shall make payment only to
contributors pursuant to section 269-G.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Wildfire risk mitigation capital
expenditures undertaken by the executive director shall be chosen to reduce
urgent risks that substantially increase the likelihood or magnitude of
qualifying damages in the event of a covered catastrophic wildfire; provided
that the expenditures shall be approved by the commission and shall not exceed
a level to prevent claims for payment before the fund can be replenished. </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§269-G  Claims for payment by contributors;
rules.</b>  The executive director shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to
create a process through which a contributor may obtain payment from the fund
to satisfy settled or finally adjudicated claims for recovery of qualifying
damages after exhausting the contributor's available insurance.  The rules
shall establish the standard for approving any settlement.  To the extent that
the fund lacks sufficient funds to make a payment to a participating utility
when sought, the fund shall make the payment upon receipt of contributions that
contributors are obligated to make to the fund under payment schedules.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§269-H  Limitation on aggregate liability.</b> 
(a)  The aggregate liability of all contributors for qualifying damages arising
from a covered catastrophic wildfire, including economic and non-economic
damages, shall not exceed the lesser of:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  $500,000,000; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The average assessed value of commercial
structures and residential structures designed for habitation in the county in
which the covered catastrophic wildfire occurred, multiplied by the number of
commercial structures or residential structures designed for habitation that
were destroyed, plus the value of personal property lost; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The aggregate assessed replacement value of
commercial structures and residential structures designed for habitation in the
county in which the covered catastrophic wildfire occurred, plus the value of
personal property lost.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The following amounts shall be added to
determine whether the aggregate liability limit has been reached:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Payments from the fund pursuant to section 269-F;
and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Payments by a contributor in connection with any
settlement or judgment on a claim for qualifying damages.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  All civil actions arising out of a
catastrophic wildfire shall be brought in the circuit in which the catastrophic
wildfire occurred.  The court shall adopt procedures to equitably apply the
limit set forth in subsection&nbsp;(a) to all filed civil claims.  All
settlements or judgments for claims for qualifying damages shall be subject to
approval by the court.  The court shall not approve any settlement or judgment
that would cause the aggregate liability of contributors to exceed the aggregate
liability limit.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  A court shall consolidate cases arising
from a covered catastrophic wildfire.  Any circuit court that is not the
consolidating court shall transfer any civil case to facilitate the
consolidation.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§269-I  Limitations on claims.</b>  (a)  No
qualifying action may be instituted or maintained by a qualified claimant
against contributors or their affiliates, employees, agents, or insurers if the
qualified claimant accepts an offer under section 269-F; provided that the
rights of a property insurer to bring an action as a subrogee of its
policyholder shall not be affected by a property owner's or tenant's acceptance
of an offer under section 269-F and the subrogation rights shall be affected
only if the property insurer elects to accept an offer under section&nbsp;269-F.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  No suit, claim, arbitration, or other
civil legal action for indemnity or contribution for amounts paid, or that may
be paid, as a result of a covered catastrophic wildfire, shall be instituted or
maintained by any persons or entities against contributors or their affiliates,
employees, agents, or insurers for damages arising out of the loss of or damage
to real or personal property from a covered catastrophic wildfire.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§269-J  Several liability.</b>  Any law to
the contrary notwithstanding, joint and several liability shall not apply to
any qualifying damages; provided that, in any action to recover qualifying
damages from a person or entity, the person or entity may claim, in defense,
apportionment of fault to any other person or entity regardless of whether that
person or entity is a party to the action.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§269-K  Reporting; refunds authorized by
legislature.</b>  (a)  The executive director shall submit to the legislature
an annual report regarding the fund no later than ninety days before the
beginning of each regular session through 2034.  The annual plan submitted by
the executive director shall include an update on the activities of the fund.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  No later than ninety days before the
regular session of 2035, the executive director shall submit a report to the
legislature regarding the financial status and resources of the fund relative
to the then-current assessment of actuarial risk of a catastrophic wildfire.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Based on the report in subsection (b), the
legislature may determine, based on recommendation by the executive director,
that the fund is overfunded and direct the executive director to refund
contributions, in whole or in part.  Any payments made to the fund that were
recovered in regulated rates from customers, and any investment earnings
associated with those payments, shall be refunded first.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§269-L  Admissibility of evidence.</b>  Any
findings made or evidence submitted for purposes of proceedings under sections 269-D,
269-F, and 269-G shall be subject to the limits of admissibility under rule
408, Hawaii rules of evidence.&quot;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     SECTION 3.  Section 269-16.22, Hawaii Revised

<u>or electricity reliability administrator,</u> arising out of power purchase
agreements that have been approved by the public utilities commission and are
binding obligations [<s>on the electric utility company,</s>] <u>to purchase
power,</u> shall be allowed to be recovered by the utility <u>or electricity
reliability administrator</u> from the customer base of the electric utility
company through one or more adjustable surcharges, which shall be established
by the public utilities commission.  The costs shall be allowed to be recovered
if incurred as a result of [<s>such</s>] <u>the</u> agreements unless, after
review by the public utilities commission, any [<s>such</s>] costs are
determined by the commission to have been incurred in bad faith, out of waste,
out of an abuse of discretion, or in violation of law.  </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><a name="_Hlk114575683">     SECTION </a>4.  Section
269-27.2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsections (b) and
(c) to read as follows:</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;(b)  The public utilities commission may
direct public utilities that supply electricity to the public <u>or the Hawaii
electricity administrator </u><u>established under part&nbsp;IX</u> to arrange
for the acquisition of and to acquire electricity generated from nonfossil fuel
sources as is available from and the producers are willing and able to make
available [<s>to the public utilities,</s>] <u>for sale,</u> and to employ and
dispatch the nonfossil fuel generated electricity in a manner consistent with
the availability thereof to maximize the reduction in consumption of fossil
fuels in the generation of electricity to be provided to the public[<s>.</s>]<u>;
provided that:</u></p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     <u>(1)</u>  <u>The commission shall have an
opportunity to review selections before power purchase contract negotiations

electric utility owns sixty per cent or more of the entity that is selling
electricity to the public for profit, or is the parent entity of an electric

power producer.</u></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The rate payable by the public utility <u>or
electricity reliability administrator</u> to the producer for the nonfossil
fuel generated electricity supplied to the public utility shall be as agreed
between the public utility <u>or electricity reliability administrator</u> and
the supplier and as approved by the public utilities commission; provided that
in the event the public utility and the supplier fail to reach an agreement for
a rate, the rate shall be as prescribed by the public utilities commission
according to the powers and procedures provided in this part.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The commission's determination of the just and
reasonable rate shall be accomplished by establishing a methodology that
removes or significantly reduces any linkage between the price of fossil fuels
and the rate for the nonfossil fuel generated electricity to potentially enable
utility customers to share in the benefits of fuel cost savings resulting from
the use of nonfossil fuel generated electricity.  As the commission deems
appropriate, the just and reasonable rate for nonfossil fuel generated
electricity supplied to the public utility by the producer may include
mechanisms for reasonable and appropriate incremental adjustments, such as
adjustments linked to consumer price indices for inflation or other acceptable
adjustment mechanisms.&quot;</p>
