BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  Chapter 269, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part I to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§269- Electric cooperative cost recovery for wildfire mitigation, repair, and restoration costs.  (a)  An electric cooperative may recover commission-approved wildfire mitigation, repair, and restoration costs through an automatic rate adjustment clause or other tariff recovery mechanism to be established by the commission. (b)  For purposes of this section, "electric cooperative" means a public utility that satisfies the requirements under section 269-31(c)." SECTION 2.  Chapter 663, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§663-     Limitation on aggregate liability.  (a)  The aggregate liability of a public utility for qualifying damages arising from a covered catastrophic wildfire shall not exceed the lesser of: (1)  $1,000,000,000; (2)  The average assessed value of commercial structures and residential structures designed for habitation in the county in which the covered catastrophic wildfire occurred, multiplied by the number of commercial structures or residential structures designed for habitation that were destroyed, plus the value of personal property lost; or (3)  The aggregate assessed replacement value of commercial structures and residential structures designed for habitation in the county in which the covered catastrophic wildfire occurred, plus the value of personal property lost. (b) All civil actions arising out of a catastrophic wildfire shall be brought in the circuit in which the catastrophic wildfire occurred.  The court shall adopt procedures to equitably apply the limit set forth in subsection (a) to all filed civil claims.  All settlements or judgments for claims for qualifying damages shall be subject to approval by the court.  The court shall not approve any settlement or judgment that would cause the aggregate liability of public utilities to exceed the aggregate liability limit. (c)  A court may consolidate cases arising from a covered catastrophic wildfire.  Any circuit court that is not the consolidating court shall transfer any civil case to facilitate the consolidation. (d) For the purposes of this section: "Catastrophic wildfire" means a wildfire occurring in the State on or after the effective date of this Act that destroys more than five hundred commercial structures or residential structures designed for habitation. "Covered catastrophic wildfire" means a catastrophic wildfire that may have been caused, or whose severity may have been increased, by a public utility's facilities or actions. "Public utility" has the same meaning as in section 269-1. "Qualifying damages" means economic damages arising out of the loss of or damage to real or personal property from a covered catastrophic wildfire." PART II SECTION 3. The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "CHAPTER SECURITIZATION §   -1  Definitions.  As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires: "Ancillary agreement" means a bond insurance policy, letter of credit, reserve account, surety bond, swap arrangement, hedging arrangement, liquidity or credit support arrangement, or other similar agreement or arrangement entered into in connection with the issuance of bonds that is designed to promote the credit quality and marketability of the bonds or to mitigate the risk of an increase in interest rates. "Assignee" means a legally recognized entity to which a public utility assigns, sells, or transfers, other than as security, all or a portion of the public utility's interest in or right to infrastructure resilience property. "Assignee" includes a corporation, limited liability company, general partnership or limited partnership, public authority, trust, financing entity, or any other legal entity to which an assignee assigns, sells, or transfers, other than as security, its interest in or right to infrastructure resilience property.

"Commission" means the public utilities commission. "Consumer" means any individual, governmental body, trust, business entity, or nonprofit organization that consumes public utility services. "Electric cooperative" means a public utility that satisfies the requirements under section 269-31(c). "Electric cooperative wildfire claims costs" means costs incurred by an electric cooperative to resolve third-party liability claims arising from any wildfire occurring in the State that are not covered by insurance and that the commission finds to be just and reasonable.  "Electric cooperative wildfire claims costs" do not include costs incurred by an investor-owned public utility.

"Financing entity" means a public utility or an entity to which a public utility or an affiliate of a public utility sells, assigns, or pledges all or a portion of the public utility's interest in infrastructure resilience property, including an affiliate of the public utility or any unaffiliated entity, in each case as approved by the commission in a financing order. Subject to section    -6(c), an entity to which a public utility sells, assigns, or pledges all or a portion of the public utility's interest in infrastructure resilience property may include any governmental entity that is able to issue bonds that are exempt from federal tax pursuant to section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including the State or a political subdivision thereof or any department, agency, or instrumentality of the State or political subdivision; provided that the bonds issued shall not constitute a general obligation of the State or any political subdivision thereof or any department, agency, or instrumentality of the State or political subdivision and shall not constitute a pledge of the full faith and credit of the entity or of the State or any political subdivision thereof, but shall be payable solely from the funds provided under this chapter. "Financing order" means an order of the commission under this chapter that has become final and no longer subject to appeal as provided by law and that authorizes the issuance of bonds and the imposition, adjustment from time to time, and collection of infrastructure resilience charges, and that shall include a procedure to require the expeditious approval by the commission of periodic adjustments to infrastructure resilience charges and to any associated fixed recovery tax amounts included in that financing order to ensure recovery of all infrastructure resilience costs and the costs associated with the proposed recovery, financing, or refinancing thereof, including the costs of servicing and retiring the bonds contemplated by the financing order. "Financing party" means any holder of the bonds; any party to or beneficiary of an ancillary agreement; and any trustee, collateral agent, or other person acting for the benefit of any of the foregoing. "Fixed recovery tax amounts" means those nonbypassable rates and other charges, including but not limited to distribution, connection, disconnection, and termination rates and charges, that are needed to recover federal and state taxes associated with infrastructure resilience charges authorized by the commission in a financing order, but are not approved as financing costs financed from proceeds of bonds. "Infrastructure resilience charges" means the nonbypassable charges, including but not limited to distribution, connection, disconnection, and termination rates and charges, that are authorized in a financing order authorized under this chapter to be imposed on and collected from all existing and future consumers of a financing entity or any successor to recover principal, interest, and other financing costs relating to the bonds. "Infrastructure resilience costs" means a public utility's costs to implement its wildfire risk mitigation plan and other investments in infrastructure improvements, modernization, and replacement needed to reduce wildfire risks and increase reliability and resilience to natural disasters and weather-related events, as approved by the commission. "Infrastructure resilience property" means the property right created pursuant to this chapter, including but not limited to the right, title, and interest of a public utility, financing entity, or its assignee: (1)  In and to the infrastructure resilience charge established pursuant to a financing order, including the right to impose, bill, collect, and receive such infrastructure resilience charges under the financing order and all rights to obtain adjustments to the infrastructure resilience charge in accordance with section    -3 and the financing order; and (2)  To be paid the amount that is determined in a financing order to be the amount that the public utility or its assignee is lawfully entitled to receive pursuant to this chapter and the proceeds thereof, and in and to all revenues, collections, claims, payments, moneys, or proceeds of, or arising from, the infrastructure resilience charge that is the subject of a financing order. "Infrastructure resilience property" does not include a right to be paid fixed recovery tax amounts.  "Infrastructure resilience property" shall constitute a current property right, notwithstanding the fact that the value of the property right will depend on consumers using public utility services or, in those instances where consumers are customers of the public utility, the public utility performing certain services. "Investor-owned public utility" means a public utility that is owned by shareholders and overseen by a board of directors elected by shareholders. "Public utility" has the same meaning as in section 269-1. "True-up adjustment" means a formulaic adjustment to the infrastructure resilience charges as they appear on consumer bills that is necessary to correct for any overcollection or undercollection of the infrastructure resilience charges authorized by a financing order and to otherwise ensure the timely and complete payment and recovery of infrastructure resilience costs over the authorized repayment term. "Wildfire risk mitigation plan" means a plan, which may include a natural hazard mitigation report, in which a public utility addresses how the public utility will mitigate the risk to its equipment in the event of a wildfire. §   -2  Applications to issue bonds and authorize infrastructure resilience charges.  (a)  A public utility may apply to the commission for one or more financing orders to issue bonds to recover any infrastructure resilience costs, each of which authorizes the following: (1)  The imposition, charging, and collection of an infrastructure resilience charge, to become effective upon the issuance of the bonds, and an adjustment of any such infrastructure resilience charge in accordance with a true-up adjustment mechanism under this chapter in amounts sufficient to pay the principal and interest on the bonds and all other associated financing costs on a timely basis; (2)  The creation of infrastructure resilience property under the financing order; and (3)  The imposition, charging, and collection of fixed recovery tax amounts to recover any portion of the public utility's federal and state taxes associated with those infrastructure resilience charges and not financed from the proceeds of bonds. (b) The application shall include all of the following: (1)  The infrastructure resilience costs to be financed through the issuance of bonds; (2)  The principal amount of the bonds proposed to be issued and the selection of a financing entity; (3)  An estimate of the date on which each series of bonds is expected to be issued; (4)  The scheduled final payment date, which shall not exceed thirty years, and a legal final maturity date, which may be longer, subject to rating agency and market considerations, during which term the infrastructure resilience charge associated with the issuance of each series of bonds is expected to be imposed and collected; (5)  An estimate of the financing costs associated with the issuance of each series of bonds; (6)  An estimate of the amount of the infrastructure resilience charge revenues necessary to pay principal and interest on the bonds and all other associated financing costs as set forth in the application and calculation for that estimate; (7)  A proposed design of the infrastructure resilience charge and a proposed methodology for allocating the infrastructure resilience charge among customer classes within the public utility's service territory; (8)  A description of the financing entity selected by the public utility; (9)  A description of a proposed true-up adjustment mechanism for the adjustment of the infrastructure resilience charge to correct for any overcollection or undercollection of the infrastructure resilience charge, and to otherwise ensure the timely payment of principal and interest on the bonds and all other associated financing costs; and (10)  Any other information required by the commission. (c)  A public utility may file an application for a financing order, or as a joint applicant with one or more affiliate public utilities, to issue bonds to recover infrastructure resilience costs. The application shall include a description of: (1)  How the infrastructure resilience charges will be allocated among the applicant public utilities in a manner that is equitable and that need not correspond to the incurrence of infrastructure resilience costs by each public utility; and (2)  Whether and how the consumers of any of the applicant public utilities will be responsible for the payment of infrastructure resilience charges allocated to consumers of affiliate public utilities. In the alternative, a public utility may apply for a financing order to issue bonds to recover infrastructure resilience costs, including infrastructure resilience costs incurred, or to be incurred, by the applicant and one or more of its affiliate public utilities.  In connection with the issuance of a financing order pursuant to this subsection, the commission shall issue a concurrent order to the affiliate public utility or public utilities directing the affiliate public utility or public utilities to impose rates on its or their consumers designed to generate revenue sufficient to pay credits over the life of the bonds to the applicant public utility in the amount as the commission determines is equitable, just, and reasonable.  The application shall describe the allocation method and adjustment mechanism for the affiliate public utility credit payments proposed to be subject to the concurrent commission order. (d) The commission shall issue an approval or denial of any application for a financing order filed pursuant to this section within ninety days of the last filing in the applicable docket but no later than one year after the application is filed. (e) In exercising its duties under this section, the commission shall consider: (1)  Whether the recovery of costs is consistent with the public interest; (2)  Whether the structuring, marketing, and pricing of the bonds are expected to result in the lowest infrastructure resilience charges consistent with market conditions at the time at which the bonds are priced and the terms of the financing order; (3)  Whether the terms and conditions of any bonds to be issued are just and reasonable; (4)  With respect to an application by an investor-owned public utility, whether the recovery of infrastructure resilience costs through the designation of the infrastructure resilience charges and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts, and the issuance of bonds in connection with the infrastructure resilience charges, would result in net savings or mitigate rate impacts to consumers, as compared to rate recovery without securitization; and (5)  Any other factors that the commission deems reasonable and in the public interest. If the commission makes the determination specified in this section, the commission shall establish, as part of the financing order, a procedure for the public utility to submit applications from time to time to request the issuance of additional financing orders designating infrastructure resilience charges and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts as recoverable. A public utility may include in its application for a financing order a request for authorization to sell, transfer, assign, or pledge infrastructure resilience property to a governmental entity if the public utility expects bonds issued by a governmental entity to result in a more cost-efficient means, taking into account all financing costs related to the bonds, than using another financing entity to issue bonds to finance the same infrastructure resilience costs, taking into account the costs of issuing the other financing entity's bonds. (f)  Infrastructure resilience charges and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts shall be imposed only on existing and future consumers in the utility service territory.  Consumers within the utility service territory of the public utility that are subject to the financing order shall continue to pay infrastructure resilience charges and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts until the bonds and associated financing costs are paid in full by the financing entity. §   -3  Infrastructure resilience financing order.  (a)  A financing order shall remain in effect until the bonds issued under the financing order and all financing costs related to the bonds have been paid in full or defeased by their terms.  The financing order shall be for no greater than $500,000,000 of the infrastructure resilience costs. A financing order shall remain in effect and unabated notwithstanding the bankruptcy, reorganization, or insolvency of the public utility or the commencement of any judicial or nonjudicial proceeding on the financing order. (b) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, with respect to infrastructure resilience property that has been made the basis for the issuance of bonds and with respect to any associated fixed recovery tax amounts, the financing order, the infrastructure resilience charges, and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts shall be irrevocable.  The State and its agencies, including the commission, pledge and agree with bondholders, the owners and assignees of the infrastructure resilience property, and other financing parties that the State and its agencies shall not take any action listed in this subsection.  This subsection shall not preclude an action if the action would not adversely affect the interests of the public utility and of assignees of the infrastructure resilience property.  The prohibited actions shall be the following: (1)  Alter the provisions of this chapter, which authorize the commission to create an irrevocable contract right or choice in action by the issuance of a financing order, to create infrastructure resilience property and make the infrastructure resilience charges imposed by a financing order irrevocable, binding, nonbypassable charges for all existing and future consumers; (2)  Take or permit any action that impairs or would impair the value of infrastructure resilience property or the security for the bonds or revise the infrastructure resilience costs for which recovery is authorized; (3)  In any way impair the rights and remedies of the bondholders, assignees, and other financing parties; and (4)  Except for changes made pursuant to the true-up adjustment authorized under subsection (d), reduce, alter, or impair infrastructure resilience charges that are to be imposed, billed, charged, collected, and remitted for the benefit of the bondholders, any assignee, and any other financing parties until any and all principal, interest, premium, financing costs, and other fees, expenses, or charges incurred, and any contracts to be performed, in connection with the related bonds have been paid and performed in full. The financing entity may include this pledge in the bonds. (c) Under a financing order, the public utility shall retain sole discretion to select the financing entity and to cause bonds to be issued, including the right to defer or postpone the issuance, assignment, sale, or transfer of infrastructure resilience property. (d) The commission may create, pursuant to an application from a public utility, a nonbypassable charge referred to as a infrastructure resilience charge, which shall be applied to recover principal, interest, and other financing costs relating to the bonds. The infrastructure resilience charge shall be a dedicated, discrete tariff rider. The commission, in any financing order, shall establish a procedure for periodic true-up adjustments to infrastructure resilience charges, which shall be made at least annually and may be made more frequently.  Within thirty days after receiving a public utility's filing of a true-up adjustment, the commission's review of the filing shall be limited to mathematical or clerical errors as determined in accordance with any true-up adjustment formulas set forth in the applicable financing order. The commission shall either approve the filing or inform the public utility of any mathematical or clerical errors in its calculation.  If the commission informs the public utility of mathematical or clerical errors in its calculation, the public utility shall correct its error and refile its true-up adjustment.  The timeframes previously described in this subsection shall apply to a refiled true-up adjustment. (e) Neither financing orders nor bonds issued under this chapter shall constitute a general obligation of the State or any of its political subdivisions, nor shall they constitute a pledge of the full faith and credit of the State or any of its political subdivisions, but shall be payable solely from the infrastructure resilience property provided under this chapter. All bonds shall contain on the face thereof a statement to the following effect: "Neither the full faith and credit nor the taxing power of the State of Hawaii is pledged to the payment of the principal of, or interest and premium on, this bond." The issuance of bonds under this chapter shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate the State or any of its political subdivisions to levy or pledge any form of taxation or make any appropriation for their payment. (f)  Infrastructure resilience charges are infrastructure resilience property when, and to the extent that, a financing order authorizing the infrastructure resilience charges has become effective in accordance with this chapter, and the infrastructure resilience property shall thereafter continuously exist as property for all purposes, and all of the rights and privileges relating to that property shall continuously exist for the period and to the extent provided in the financing order, but in any event until the bonds, including all principal; premiums, if any; interest with respect to the bonds; and all other financing costs are paid in full.  A financing order may provide that the creation of infrastructure resilience property shall be simultaneous with the sale of the infrastructure resilience property to an assignee as provided in the application of the pledge of the infrastructure resilience property to secure the bonds. (g) Any successor to a financing entity shall be bound by the requirements of this chapter and shall perform and satisfy all obligations of and have the same rights under a financing order as, and to the same extent as, the financing entity. (h)  No public utility approved for a financing order shall increase compensation for its executive officers unless the utility's wildfire risk mitigation plan compliance reports have been approved by the commission for five consecutive years; provided that the commission may consider an alternative symmetric performance incentive mechanism, if the commission deems appropriate.  For the purposes of this subsection, "wildfire risk mitigation plan" has the same meaning as in section    -1. §   -4  Bonds; issuance; infrastructure resilience property interests.  (a)  The public utility may sell and assign all or portions of its interest in infrastructure resilience property to one or more financing entities that make that infrastructure resilience property the basis for issuance of bonds, to the extent approved in a financing order.  The public utility or financing entity may pledge infrastructure resilience property as collateral, directly or indirectly, for bonds to the extent approved in the pertinent financing orders providing for a security interest in the infrastructure resilience property, in the manner set forth in this section.  In addition, infrastructure resilience property may be sold or assigned by either of the following: (1)  The financing entity or a trustee for the holders of bonds or the holders of an ancillary agreement in connection with the exercise of remedies upon a default under the terms of the bonds; or (2)  Any person acquiring the infrastructure resilience property after a sale or assignment pursuant to this chapter. (b) To the extent that any interest in infrastructure resilience property is sold, assigned, or is pledged as collateral pursuant to subsection (a), the commission may authorize the public utility to contract with the financing entity or its assignees that the public utility will: (1)  Continue to operate its system to provide service to consumers within its service territory; (2)  Collect amounts in respect of the infrastructure resilience charges for the benefit and account of the financing entity or its assignees; and (3)  Account for and remit these amounts to or for the account of the financing entity or its assignees. Contracting with the financing entity or its assignees in accordance with that authorization shall not impair or negate the characterization of the sale, assignment, or pledge as an absolute transfer, a true sale, or a security interest, as applicable.  To the extent that billing, collection, and other related services with respect to the provision of the public utility's services are provided to a consumer by any person or entity other than the public utility in whose service territory the consumer is located, that person or entity shall collect the infrastructure resilience charges and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts from the consumer for the benefit and account of the public utility, financing entity, or assignees with the associated revenues remitted solely for the person's benefit as a condition to the provision of public utility service to that consumer. Each financing order shall impose terms and conditions, consistent with the purposes and objectives of this chapter, on any person or entity responsible for billing, collection, and other related services, including but not limited to collection of the infrastructure resilience charges and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts, that are the subject of the financing order. (c) The financing entity may issue bonds upon approval by the commission in a financing order.  Bonds shall be nonrecourse to the credit or any assets of the public utility, other than the infrastructure resilience property as specified in that financing order. (d)  Infrastructure resilience property that is specified in a financing order shall constitute an existing, present property right, notwithstanding the fact that the imposition and collection of infrastructure resilience charges depend on the public utility's continuing to provide services or continuing to perform its servicing functions relating to the collection of infrastructure resilience charges or on the level of future service consumption, such as consumption of a public utility service.  Infrastructure resilience property shall exist whether or not the infrastructure resilience charges have been billed, have accrued, or have been collected, and notwithstanding the fact that the value for a security interest in the infrastructure resilience property, or amount of the infrastructure resilience property, is dependent on the future provision of service to consumers.  All infrastructure resilience property specified in a financing order shall continue to exist until the bonds issued pursuant to a financing order and all associated financing costs are paid in full. (e)  Infrastructure resilience property; infrastructure resilience charges; and the interests of an assignee, bondholder, or financing entity, or any pledgee in infrastructure resilience property and infrastructure resilience charges shall not be subject to setoff, counterclaim, surcharge, recoupment, or defense by the public utility or any other person or in connection with the bankruptcy, reorganization, or other insolvency proceeding of the public utility, any affiliate of the public utility, or any other entity. (f) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, any requirement under this chapter or a financing order that the commission acts upon shall be binding upon the commission, as it may be constituted from time to time, and any successor agency exercising functions similar to the commission, and the commission shall have no authority to rescind, alter, or amend that requirement in a financing order. §   -5  Infrastructure resilience charge.  (a) The infrastructure resilience charge created pursuant to a financing order approved pursuant to section    -2 shall be a nonbypassable charge of a financing entity that shall be applied to the repayment of bonds and related financing costs as described in this chapter.  The infrastructure resilience charge and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts may be a usage-based charge, a flat user charge, or a charge based upon customer revenues as determined by the commission for each consumer class in any financing order. (b) As long as any bonds are outstanding and any financing costs have not been paid in full, any infrastructure resilience charge and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts authorized under a financing order shall be nonbypassable.  Subject to any exceptions provided in a financing order, a infrastructure resilience charge and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts shall be paid by all existing and future consumers within the utility service territory. (c) The infrastructure resilience charge shall be collected by a public utility or its successors, in accordance with section    -8(a), in full through a charge that is separate and apart from the public utility's rates. (d)  A public utility may exercise the same rights and remedies under its tariff and applicable law and regulation based on a consumer's nonpayment of the infrastructure resilience charge as it could for a consumer's failure to pay any other charge payable to that public utility. §   -6  Security interests in infrastructure resilience property; financing statements. (a)  A security interest in infrastructure resilience property is valid and enforceable against the pledgor and third parties, subject to the rights of any third parties holding security interests in the infrastructure resilience property perfected in the manner described in this section, and attaches when all of the following have occurred: (1)  The commission has issued a financing order authorizing the infrastructure resilience charge to be included in the infrastructure resilience property; (2)  Value has been given by the pledgees of the infrastructure resilience property; and (3)  The pledgor has signed a security agreement covering the infrastructure resilience property. (b) A valid and enforceable security interest in infrastructure resilience property is perfected when it has attached and when a financing statement has been filed with the bureau of conveyances naming the pledgor of the infrastructure resilience property as "debtor" and identifying the infrastructure resilience property. Any description of the infrastructure resilience property shall be sufficient if it refers to the financing order creating the infrastructure resilience property.  A copy of the financing statement shall be filed with the commission by the public utility that is the pledgor or transferor of the infrastructure resilience property.  The commission may require the public utility to make other filings with respect to the security interest in accordance with procedures that the commission may establish; provided that the filings shall not affect the perfection of the security interest. (c) A perfected security interest in infrastructure resilience property shall be a continuously perfected security interest in all infrastructure resilience property revenues and proceeds arising with respect thereto, whether or not the revenues or proceeds have accrued. Conflicting security interests shall rank according to priority in time of perfection.  Infrastructure resilience property shall constitute property for all purposes, including for contracts securing bonds, whether or not the infrastructure resilience property revenues and proceeds have accrued. (d) Subject to the terms of the security agreement covering the infrastructure resilience property and the rights of any third parties holding security interests in the infrastructure resilience property, perfected in the manner described in this section, the validity and relative priority of a security interest created under this section shall not be defeated or adversely affected by the commingling of revenues arising with respect to the infrastructure resilience property with other funds of the public utility that is the pledgor or transferor of the infrastructure resilience property, or by any security interest in a deposit account of that public utility perfected under article 9 of chapter 490, into which the revenues are deposited. Subject to the terms of the security agreement, upon compliance with the requirements of section 490:9-312(b)(1), the pledgees of the infrastructure resilience property shall have a perfected security interest in all cash and deposit accounts of the public utility in which infrastructure resilience property revenues have been commingled with other funds. (e) If default occurs under the security agreement covering the infrastructure resilience property, the pledgees of the infrastructure resilience property, subject to the terms of the security agreement, shall have all rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under article 9 of chapter 490 and shall be entitled to foreclose or otherwise enforce their security interest in the infrastructure resilience property, subject to the rights of any third parties holding prior security interests in the infrastructure resilience property perfected in the manner provided in this section. In addition, the commission may require in the financing order creating the infrastructure resilience property that in the event of default by the public utility in payment of infrastructure resilience property revenues, the commission and any successor thereto, upon the application by the pledgees or assignees, including assignees under section    -4 of the infrastructure resilience property, and without limiting any other remedies available to the pledgees or assignees by reason of the default, shall order the sequestration and payment to the pledgees or assignees of infrastructure resilience property revenues.  Any financing order shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any bankruptcy, reorganization, or other insolvency proceedings with respect to the debtor, pledgor, or transferor of the infrastructure resilience property.  Any surplus in excess of amounts necessary to pay principal; premiums, if any; interest, costs, and arrearages on the bonds; and associated financing costs arising under the security agreement, shall be remitted to the debtor, pledgor, or transferor, for the purpose of remitting such amounts to customers via the public utility. (f) Sections 490:9-204 and 490:9-205 shall apply to a pledge of infrastructure resilience property by the public utility, an affiliate of the public utility, or a financing entity. §   -7  Transfers of infrastructure resilience property.  (a)  A transfer or assignment of infrastructure resilience property by the public utility to an assignee or to a financing entity, or by an assignee of the public utility or a financing entity to another financing entity, which the parties in the governing documentation have expressly stated to be a sale or other absolute transfer, in a transaction approved in a financing order, shall be treated as an absolute transfer of all of the transferor's right, title, and interest, as in a true sale, and not as a pledge or other financing, of the infrastructure resilience property, other than for federal and state income and franchise tax purposes. (b) The characterization of the sale, assignment, or transfer as an absolute transfer and true sale and the corresponding characterization of the property interest of the assignee shall not be affected or impaired by, among other things, the occurrence of any of the following: (1)  Commingling of infrastructure resilience charge revenues with other amounts; (2)  The retention by the seller of either of the following: (A)  A partial or residual interest, including an equity interest, in the financing entity or the infrastructure resilience property, whether direct or indirect, subordinate or otherwise; or (B)  The right to recover costs associated with taxes, franchise fees, or license fees imposed on the collection of infrastructure resilience charge; (3)  Any recourse that an assignee may have against the seller; (4)  Any indemnification rights, obligations, or repurchase rights made or provided by the seller; (5)  The obligation of the seller to collect infrastructure resilience charges on behalf of an assignee; (6)  The treatment of the sale, assignment, or transfer for tax, financial reporting, or other purpose; or (7)  Any true-up adjustment of the infrastructure resilience charge as provided in the financing order. (c) A transfer of infrastructure resilience property shall be deemed perfected against third parties when: (1)  The commission issues the financing order authorizing the infrastructure resilience charge included in the infrastructure resilience property; and (2)  An assignment of the infrastructure resilience property in writing has been executed and delivered to the assignee. (d) As between bona fide assignees of the same right for value without notice, the assignee first filing a financing statement with the bureau of conveyances in accordance with part 5 of article 9 of chapter 490, naming the assignor of the infrastructure resilience property as debtor and identifying the infrastructure resilience property, shall have priority.  Any description of the infrastructure resilience property shall be sufficient if it refers to the financing order creating the infrastructure resilience property.  A copy of the financing statement shall be filed by the assignee with the commission, and the commission may require the assignor or the assignee to make other filings with respect to the transfer in accordance with procedures the commission may establish; provided that these filings shall not affect the perfection of the transfer. §   -8  Financing entity successor requirements; default of financing entity. (a)  Any successor to a public utility subject to a financing order, whether pursuant to any bankruptcy, reorganization, or other insolvency proceeding, or pursuant to any merger, sale, or transfer, by operation of law, or otherwise, shall be bound by the requirements of this chapter.  The successor of the public utility shall perform and satisfy all obligations of the public utility under the financing order in the same manner and to the same extent as the public utility, including the obligation to collect and pay the infrastructure resilience charge to any financing party as required by a financing order or any assignee.  Any successor to the public utility shall be entitled to receive any fixed recovery tax amounts otherwise payable to the public utility. (b) The commission may require in a financing order that, if a default by the public utility in remittance of the infrastructure resilience charge collected arising with respect to infrastructure resilience property occurs, the commission, without limiting any other remedies available to any financing party by reason of the default, shall order the sequestration and payment to the beneficiaries of the infrastructure resilience charge collected arising with respect to the infrastructure resilience property.  Any order shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any bankruptcy, reorganization, or other insolvency proceedings with respect to the public utility. §   -9  Severability.  If any provision of this chapter is held to be invalid or is superseded, replaced, repealed, or expires for any reason: (1)  That occurrence shall not affect any action allowed under this chapter that is taken prior to that occurrence by the commission, a financing entity, a bondholder, or any financing party, and any such action shall remain in full force and effect; and (2)  The validity and enforceability of the rest of this chapter shall remain unaffected."

BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  Chapter 269, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part I to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§269- Electric cooperative cost recovery for wildfire mitigation, repair, and restoration costs.  (a)  An electric cooperative may recover commission-approved wildfire mitigation, repair, and restoration costs through an automatic rate adjustment clause or other tariff recovery mechanism to be established by the commission. (b)  For purposes of this section, "electric cooperative" means a public utility that satisfies the requirements under section 269-31(c)." SECTION 2.  Chapter 663, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§663-     Limitation on aggregate liability.  (a)  The aggregate liability of a public utility for qualifying damages arising from a covered catastrophic wildfire shall not exceed the lesser of: (1)  $1,000,000,000; (2)  The average assessed value of commercial structures and residential structures designed for habitation in the county in which the covered catastrophic wildfire occurred, multiplied by the number of commercial structures or residential structures designed for habitation that were destroyed, plus the value of personal property lost; or (3)  The aggregate assessed replacement value of commercial structures and residential structures designed for habitation in the county in which the covered catastrophic wildfire occurred, plus the value of personal property lost. (b) All civil actions arising out of a catastrophic wildfire shall be brought in the circuit in which the catastrophic wildfire occurred.  The court shall adopt procedures to equitably apply the limit set forth in subsection (a) to all filed civil claims.  All settlements or judgments for claims for qualifying damages shall be subject to approval by the court.  The court shall not approve any settlement or judgment that would cause the aggregate liability of public utilities to exceed the aggregate liability limit.

(d) For the purposes of this section: "Catastrophic wildfire" means a wildfire occurring in the State on or after the effective date of this Act that destroys more than five hundred commercial structures or residential structures designed for habitation. "Covered catastrophic wildfire" means a catastrophic wildfire that may have been caused, or whose severity may have been increased, by a public utility's facilities or actions. "Public utility" has the same meaning as in section 269-1. "Qualifying damages" means economic damages arising out of the loss of or damage to real or personal property from a covered catastrophic wildfire." PART II SECTION 3.

Subject to section    -6(c), an entity to which a public utility sells, assigns, or pledges all or a portion of the public utility's interest in infrastructure resilience property may include any governmental entity that is able to issue bonds that are exempt from federal tax pursuant to section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including the State or a political subdivision thereof or any department, agency, or instrumentality of the State or political subdivision; provided that the bonds issued shall not constitute a general obligation of the State or any political subdivision thereof or any department, agency, or instrumentality of the State or political subdivision and shall not constitute a pledge of the full faith and credit of the entity or of the State or any political subdivision thereof, but shall be payable solely from the funds provided under this chapter. "Financing order" means an order of the commission under this chapter that has become final and no longer subject to appeal as provided by law and that authorizes the issuance of bonds and the imposition, adjustment from time to time, and collection of infrastructure resilience charges, and that shall include a procedure to require the expeditious approval by the commission of periodic adjustments to infrastructure resilience charges and to any associated fixed recovery tax amounts included in that financing order to ensure recovery of all infrastructure resilience costs and the costs associated with the proposed recovery, financing, or refinancing thereof, including the costs of servicing and retiring the bonds contemplated by the financing order. "Financing party" means any holder of the bonds; any party to or beneficiary of an ancillary agreement; and any trustee, collateral agent, or other person acting for the benefit of any of the foregoing.

"Infrastructure resilience property" means the property right created pursuant to this chapter, including but not limited to the right, title, and interest of a public utility, financing entity, or its assignee: (1)  In and to the infrastructure resilience charge established pursuant to a financing order, including the right to impose, bill, collect, and receive such infrastructure resilience charges under the financing order and all rights to obtain adjustments to the infrastructure resilience charge in accordance with section    -3 and the financing order; and (2)  To be paid the amount that is determined in a financing order to be the amount that the public utility or its assignee is lawfully entitled to receive pursuant to this chapter and the proceeds thereof, and in and to all revenues, collections, claims, payments, moneys, or proceeds of, or arising from, the infrastructure resilience charge that is the subject of a financing order. "Infrastructure resilience property" does not include a right to be paid fixed recovery tax amounts.  "Infrastructure resilience property" shall constitute a current property right, notwithstanding the fact that the value of the property right will depend on consumers using public utility services or, in those instances where consumers are customers of the public utility, the public utility performing certain services. "Investor-owned public utility" means a public utility that is owned by shareholders and overseen by a board of directors elected by shareholders. "Public utility" has the same meaning as in section 269-1. "True-up adjustment" means a formulaic adjustment to the infrastructure resilience charges as they appear on consumer bills that is necessary to correct for any overcollection or undercollection of the infrastructure resilience charges authorized by a financing order and to otherwise ensure the timely and complete payment and recovery of infrastructure resilience costs over the authorized repayment term. "Wildfire risk mitigation plan" means a plan, which may include a natural hazard mitigation report, in which a public utility addresses how the public utility will mitigate the risk to its equipment in the event of a wildfire. §   -2  Applications to issue bonds and authorize infrastructure resilience charges.  (a)  A public utility may apply to the commission for one or more financing orders to issue bonds to recover any infrastructure resilience costs, each of which authorizes the following: (1)  The imposition, charging, and collection of an infrastructure resilience charge, to become effective upon the issuance of the bonds, and an adjustment of any such infrastructure resilience charge in accordance with a true-up adjustment mechanism under this chapter in amounts sufficient to pay the principal and interest on the bonds and all other associated financing costs on a timely basis; (2)  The creation of infrastructure resilience property under the financing order; and (3)  The imposition, charging, and collection of fixed recovery tax amounts to recover any portion of the public utility's federal and state taxes associated with those infrastructure resilience charges and not financed from the proceeds of bonds. (b) The application shall include all of the following: (1)  The infrastructure resilience costs to be financed through the issuance of bonds; (2)  The principal amount of the bonds proposed to be issued and the selection of a financing entity; (3)  An estimate of the date on which each series of bonds is expected to be issued; (4)  The scheduled final payment date, which shall not exceed thirty years, and a legal final maturity date, which may be longer, subject to rating agency and market considerations, during which term the infrastructure resilience charge associated with the issuance of each series of bonds is expected to be imposed and collected; (5)  An estimate of the financing costs associated with the issuance of each series of bonds; (6)  An estimate of the amount of the infrastructure resilience charge revenues necessary to pay principal and interest on the bonds and all other associated financing costs as set forth in the application and calculation for that estimate; (7)  A proposed design of the infrastructure resilience charge and a proposed methodology for allocating the infrastructure resilience charge among customer classes within the public utility's service territory; (8)  A description of the financing entity selected by the public utility; (9)  A description of a proposed true-up adjustment mechanism for the adjustment of the infrastructure resilience charge to correct for any overcollection or undercollection of the infrastructure resilience charge, and to otherwise ensure the timely payment of principal and interest on the bonds and all other associated financing costs; and (10)  Any other information required by the commission. (c)  A public utility may file an application for a financing order, or as a joint applicant with one or more affiliate public utilities, to issue bonds to recover infrastructure resilience costs. The application shall include a description of: (1)  How the infrastructure resilience charges will be allocated among the applicant public utilities in a manner that is equitable and that need not correspond to the incurrence of infrastructure resilience costs by each public utility; and (2)  Whether and how the consumers of any of the applicant public utilities will be responsible for the payment of infrastructure resilience charges allocated to consumers of affiliate public utilities. In the alternative, a public utility may apply for a financing order to issue bonds to recover infrastructure resilience costs, including infrastructure resilience costs incurred, or to be incurred, by the applicant and one or more of its affiliate public utilities.  In connection with the issuance of a financing order pursuant to this subsection, the commission shall issue a concurrent order to the affiliate public utility or public utilities directing the affiliate public utility or public utilities to impose rates on its or their consumers designed to generate revenue sufficient to pay credits over the life of the bonds to the applicant public utility in the amount as the commission determines is equitable, just, and reasonable.  The application shall describe the allocation method and adjustment mechanism for the affiliate public utility credit payments proposed to be subject to the concurrent commission order. (d) The commission shall issue an approval or denial of any application for a financing order filed pursuant to this section within ninety days of the last filing in the applicable docket but no later than one year after the application is filed. (e) In exercising its duties under this section, the commission shall consider: (1)  Whether the recovery of costs is consistent with the public interest; (2)  Whether the structuring, marketing, and pricing of the bonds are expected to result in the lowest infrastructure resilience charges consistent with market conditions at the time at which the bonds are priced and the terms of the financing order; (3)  Whether the terms and conditions of any bonds to be issued are just and reasonable; (4)  With respect to an application by an investor-owned public utility, whether the recovery of infrastructure resilience costs through the designation of the infrastructure resilience charges and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts, and the issuance of bonds in connection with the infrastructure resilience charges, would result in net savings or mitigate rate impacts to consumers, as compared to rate recovery without securitization; and (5)  Any other factors that the commission deems reasonable and in the public interest. If the commission makes the determination specified in this section, the commission shall establish, as part of the financing order, a procedure for the public utility to submit applications from time to time to request the issuance of additional financing orders designating infrastructure resilience charges and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts as recoverable. A public utility may include in its application for a financing order a request for authorization to sell, transfer, assign, or pledge infrastructure resilience property to a governmental entity if the public utility expects bonds issued by a governmental entity to result in a more cost-efficient means, taking into account all financing costs related to the bonds, than using another financing entity to issue bonds to finance the same infrastructure resilience costs, taking into account the costs of issuing the other financing entity's bonds. (f)  Infrastructure resilience charges and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts shall be imposed only on existing and future consumers in the utility service territory.  Consumers within the utility service territory of the public utility that are subject to the financing order shall continue to pay infrastructure resilience charges and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts until the bonds and associated financing costs are paid in full by the financing entity. §   -3  Infrastructure resilience financing order.  (a)  A financing order shall remain in effect until the bonds issued under the financing order and all financing costs related to the bonds have been paid in full or defeased by their terms.  The financing order shall be for no greater than $500,000,000 of the infrastructure resilience costs. A financing order shall remain in effect and unabated notwithstanding the bankruptcy, reorganization, or insolvency of the public utility or the commencement of any judicial or nonjudicial proceeding on the financing order. (b) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, with respect to infrastructure resilience property that has been made the basis for the issuance of bonds and with respect to any associated fixed recovery tax amounts, the financing order, the infrastructure resilience charges, and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts shall be irrevocable.  The State and its agencies, including the commission, pledge and agree with bondholders, the owners and assignees of the infrastructure resilience property, and other financing parties that the State and its agencies shall not take any action listed in this subsection.  This subsection shall not preclude an action if the action would not adversely affect the interests of the public utility and of assignees of the infrastructure resilience property.  The prohibited actions shall be the following: (1)  Alter the provisions of this chapter, which authorize the commission to create an irrevocable contract right or choice in action by the issuance of a financing order, to create infrastructure resilience property and make the infrastructure resilience charges imposed by a financing order irrevocable, binding, nonbypassable charges for all existing and future consumers; (2)  Take or permit any action that impairs or would impair the value of infrastructure resilience property or the security for the bonds or revise the infrastructure resilience costs for which recovery is authorized; (3)  In any way impair the rights and remedies of the bondholders, assignees, and other financing parties; and (4)  Except for changes made pursuant to the true-up adjustment authorized under subsection (d), reduce, alter, or impair infrastructure resilience charges that are to be imposed, billed, charged, collected, and remitted for the benefit of the bondholders, any assignee, and any other financing parties until any and all principal, interest, premium, financing costs, and other fees, expenses, or charges incurred, and any contracts to be performed, in connection with the related bonds have been paid and performed in full. The financing entity may include this pledge in the bonds. (c) Under a financing order, the public utility shall retain sole discretion to select the financing entity and to cause bonds to be issued, including the right to defer or postpone the issuance, assignment, sale, or transfer of infrastructure resilience property. (d) The commission may create, pursuant to an application from a public utility, a nonbypassable charge referred to as a infrastructure resilience charge, which shall be applied to recover principal, interest, and other financing costs relating to the bonds. The infrastructure resilience charge shall be a dedicated, discrete tariff rider. The commission, in any financing order, shall establish a procedure for periodic true-up adjustments to infrastructure resilience charges, which shall be made at least annually and may be made more frequently.  Within thirty days after receiving a public utility's filing of a true-up adjustment, the commission's review of the filing shall be limited to mathematical or clerical errors as determined in accordance with any true-up adjustment formulas set forth in the applicable financing order. The commission shall either approve the filing or inform the public utility of any mathematical or clerical errors in its calculation.  If the commission informs the public utility of mathematical or clerical errors in its calculation, the public utility shall correct its error and refile its true-up adjustment.  The timeframes previously described in this subsection shall apply to a refiled true-up adjustment. (e) Neither financing orders nor bonds issued under this chapter shall constitute a general obligation of the State or any of its political subdivisions, nor shall they constitute a pledge of the full faith and credit of the State or any of its political subdivisions, but shall be payable solely from the infrastructure resilience property provided under this chapter. All bonds shall contain on the face thereof a statement to the following effect: "Neither the full faith and credit nor the taxing power of the State of Hawaii is pledged to the payment of the principal of, or interest and premium on, this bond." The issuance of bonds under this chapter shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate the State or any of its political subdivisions to levy or pledge any form of taxation or make any appropriation for their payment. (f)  Infrastructure resilience charges are infrastructure resilience property when, and to the extent that, a financing order authorizing the infrastructure resilience charges has become effective in accordance with this chapter, and the infrastructure resilience property shall thereafter continuously exist as property for all purposes, and all of the rights and privileges relating to that property shall continuously exist for the period and to the extent provided in the financing order, but in any event until the bonds, including all principal; premiums, if any; interest with respect to the bonds; and all other financing costs are paid in full.  A financing order may provide that the creation of infrastructure resilience property shall be simultaneous with the sale of the infrastructure resilience property to an assignee as provided in the application of the pledge of the infrastructure resilience property to secure the bonds. (g) Any successor to a financing entity shall be bound by the requirements of this chapter and shall perform and satisfy all obligations of and have the same rights under a financing order as, and to the same extent as, the financing entity. (h)  No public utility approved for a financing order shall increase compensation for its executive officers unless the utility's wildfire risk mitigation plan compliance reports have been approved by the commission for five consecutive years; provided that the commission may consider an alternative symmetric performance incentive mechanism, if the commission deems appropriate.  For the purposes of this subsection, "wildfire risk mitigation plan" has the same meaning as in section    -1. §   -4  Bonds; issuance; infrastructure resilience property interests.  (a)  The public utility may sell and assign all or portions of its interest in infrastructure resilience property to one or more financing entities that make that infrastructure resilience property the basis for issuance of bonds, to the extent approved in a financing order.  The public utility or financing entity may pledge infrastructure resilience property as collateral, directly or indirectly, for bonds to the extent approved in the pertinent financing orders providing for a security interest in the infrastructure resilience property, in the manner set forth in this section.  In addition, infrastructure resilience property may be sold or assigned by either of the following: (1)  The financing entity or a trustee for the holders of bonds or the holders of an ancillary agreement in connection with the exercise of remedies upon a default under the terms of the bonds; or (2)  Any person acquiring the infrastructure resilience property after a sale or assignment pursuant to this chapter. (b) To the extent that any interest in infrastructure resilience property is sold, assigned, or is pledged as collateral pursuant to subsection (a), the commission may authorize the public utility to contract with the financing entity or its assignees that the public utility will: (1)  Continue to operate its system to provide service to consumers within its service territory; (2)  Collect amounts in respect of the infrastructure resilience charges for the benefit and account of the financing entity or its assignees; and (3)  Account for and remit these amounts to or for the account of the financing entity or its assignees. Contracting with the financing entity or its assignees in accordance with that authorization shall not impair or negate the characterization of the sale, assignment, or pledge as an absolute transfer, a true sale, or a security interest, as applicable.  To the extent that billing, collection, and other related services with respect to the provision of the public utility's services are provided to a consumer by any person or entity other than the public utility in whose service territory the consumer is located, that person or entity shall collect the infrastructure resilience charges and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts from the consumer for the benefit and account of the public utility, financing entity, or assignees with the associated revenues remitted solely for the person's benefit as a condition to the provision of public utility service to that consumer. Each financing order shall impose terms and conditions, consistent with the purposes and objectives of this chapter, on any person or entity responsible for billing, collection, and other related services, including but not limited to collection of the infrastructure resilience charges and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts, that are the subject of the financing order. (c) The financing entity may issue bonds upon approval by the commission in a financing order.  Bonds shall be nonrecourse to the credit or any assets of the public utility, other than the infrastructure resilience property as specified in that financing order. (d)  Infrastructure resilience property that is specified in a financing order shall constitute an existing, present property right, notwithstanding the fact that the imposition and collection of infrastructure resilience charges depend on the public utility's continuing to provide services or continuing to perform its servicing functions relating to the collection of infrastructure resilience charges or on the level of future service consumption, such as consumption of a public utility service.  Infrastructure resilience property shall exist whether or not the infrastructure resilience charges have been billed, have accrued, or have been collected, and notwithstanding the fact that the value for a security interest in the infrastructure resilience property, or amount of the infrastructure resilience property, is dependent on the future provision of service to consumers.  All infrastructure resilience property specified in a financing order shall continue to exist until the bonds issued pursuant to a financing order and all associated financing costs are paid in full. (e)  Infrastructure resilience property; infrastructure resilience charges; and the interests of an assignee, bondholder, or financing entity, or any pledgee in infrastructure resilience property and infrastructure resilience charges shall not be subject to setoff, counterclaim, surcharge, recoupment, or defense by the public utility or any other person or in connection with the bankruptcy, reorganization, or other insolvency proceeding of the public utility, any affiliate of the public utility, or any other entity. (f) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, any requirement under this chapter or a financing order that the commission acts upon shall be binding upon the commission, as it may be constituted from time to time, and any successor agency exercising functions similar to the commission, and the commission shall have no authority to rescind, alter, or amend that requirement in a financing order. §   -5  Infrastructure resilience charge.  (a) The infrastructure resilience charge created pursuant to a financing order approved pursuant to section    -2 shall be a nonbypassable charge of a financing entity that shall be applied to the repayment of bonds and related financing costs as described in this chapter.  The infrastructure resilience charge and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts may be a usage-based charge, a flat user charge, or a charge based upon customer revenues as determined by the commission for each consumer class in any financing order. (b) As long as any bonds are outstanding and any financing costs have not been paid in full, any infrastructure resilience charge and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts authorized under a financing order shall be nonbypassable.  Subject to any exceptions provided in a financing order, a infrastructure resilience charge and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts shall be paid by all existing and future consumers within the utility service territory. (c) The infrastructure resilience charge shall be collected by a public utility or its successors, in accordance with section    -8(a), in full through a charge that is separate and apart from the public utility's rates. (d)  A public utility may exercise the same rights and remedies under its tariff and applicable law and regulation based on a consumer's nonpayment of the infrastructure resilience charge as it could for a consumer's failure to pay any other charge payable to that public utility. §   -6  Security interests in infrastructure resilience property; financing statements. (a)  A security interest in infrastructure resilience property is valid and enforceable against the pledgor and third parties, subject to the rights of any third parties holding security interests in the infrastructure resilience property perfected in the manner described in this section, and attaches when all of the following have occurred: (1)  The commission has issued a financing order authorizing the infrastructure resilience charge to be included in the infrastructure resilience property; (2)  Value has been given by the pledgees of the infrastructure resilience property; and (3)  The pledgor has signed a security agreement covering the infrastructure resilience property. (b) A valid and enforceable security interest in infrastructure resilience property is perfected when it has attached and when a financing statement has been filed with the bureau of conveyances naming the pledgor of the infrastructure resilience property as "debtor" and identifying the infrastructure resilience property. Any description of the infrastructure resilience property shall be sufficient if it refers to the financing order creating the infrastructure resilience property.  A copy of the financing statement shall be filed with the commission by the public utility that is the pledgor or transferor of the infrastructure resilience property.  The commission may require the public utility to make other filings with respect to the security interest in accordance with procedures that the commission may establish; provided that the filings shall not affect the perfection of the security interest. (c) A perfected security interest in infrastructure resilience property shall be a continuously perfected security interest in all infrastructure resilience property revenues and proceeds arising with respect thereto, whether or not the revenues or proceeds have accrued. Conflicting security interests shall rank according to priority in time of perfection.  Infrastructure resilience property shall constitute property for all purposes, including for contracts securing bonds, whether or not the infrastructure resilience property revenues and proceeds have accrued. (d) Subject to the terms of the security agreement covering the infrastructure resilience property and the rights of any third parties holding security interests in the infrastructure resilience property, perfected in the manner described in this section, the validity and relative priority of a security interest created under this section shall not be defeated or adversely affected by the commingling of revenues arising with respect to the infrastructure resilience property with other funds of the public utility that is the pledgor or transferor of the infrastructure resilience property, or by any security interest in a deposit account of that public utility perfected under article 9 of chapter 490, into which the revenues are deposited. Subject to the terms of the security agreement, upon compliance with the requirements of section 490:9-312(b)(1), the pledgees of the infrastructure resilience property shall have a perfected security interest in all cash and deposit accounts of the public utility in which infrastructure resilience property revenues have been commingled with other funds. (e) If default occurs under the security agreement covering the infrastructure resilience property, the pledgees of the infrastructure resilience property, subject to the terms of the security agreement, shall have all rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under article 9 of chapter 490 and shall be entitled to foreclose or otherwise enforce their security interest in the infrastructure resilience property, subject to the rights of any third parties holding prior security interests in the infrastructure resilience property perfected in the manner provided in this section. In addition, the commission may require in the financing order creating the infrastructure resilience property that in the event of default by the public utility in payment of infrastructure resilience property revenues, the commission and any successor thereto, upon the application by the pledgees or assignees, including assignees under section    -4 of the infrastructure resilience property, and without limiting any other remedies available to the pledgees or assignees by reason of the default, shall order the sequestration and payment to the pledgees or assignees of infrastructure resilience property revenues.  Any financing order shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any bankruptcy, reorganization, or other insolvency proceedings with respect to the debtor, pledgor, or transferor of the infrastructure resilience property.  Any surplus in excess of amounts necessary to pay principal; premiums, if any; interest, costs, and arrearages on the bonds; and associated financing costs arising under the security agreement, shall be remitted to the debtor, pledgor, or transferor, for the purpose of remitting such amounts to customers via the public utility. (f) Sections 490:9-204 and 490:9-205 shall apply to a pledge of infrastructure resilience property by the public utility, an affiliate of the public utility, or a financing entity. §   -7  Transfers of infrastructure resilience property.  (a)  A transfer or assignment of infrastructure resilience property by the public utility to an assignee or to a financing entity, or by an assignee of the public utility or a financing entity to another financing entity, which the parties in the governing documentation have expressly stated to be a sale or other absolute transfer, in a transaction approved in a financing order, shall be treated as an absolute transfer of all of the transferor's right, title, and interest, as in a true sale, and not as a pledge or other financing, of the infrastructure resilience property, other than for federal and state income and franchise tax purposes. (b) The characterization of the sale, assignment, or transfer as an absolute transfer and true sale and the corresponding characterization of the property interest of the assignee shall not be affected or impaired by, among other things, the occurrence of any of the following: (1)  Commingling of infrastructure resilience charge revenues with other amounts; (2)  The retention by the seller of either of the following: (A)  A partial or residual interest, including an equity interest, in the financing entity or the infrastructure resilience property, whether direct or indirect, subordinate or otherwise; or (B)  The right to recover costs associated with taxes, franchise fees, or license fees imposed on the collection of infrastructure resilience charge; (3)  Any recourse that an assignee may have against the seller; (4)  Any indemnification rights, obligations, or repurchase rights made or provided by the seller; (5)  The obligation of the seller to collect infrastructure resilience charges on behalf of an assignee; (6)  The treatment of the sale, assignment, or transfer for tax, financial reporting, or other purpose; or (7)  Any true-up adjustment of the infrastructure resilience charge as provided in the financing order. (c) A transfer of infrastructure resilience property shall be deemed perfected against third parties when: (1)  The commission issues the financing order authorizing the infrastructure resilience charge included in the infrastructure resilience property; and (2)  An assignment of the infrastructure resilience property in writing has been executed and delivered to the assignee. (d) As between bona fide assignees of the same right for value without notice, the assignee first filing a financing statement with the bureau of conveyances in accordance with part 5 of article 9 of chapter 490, naming the assignor of the infrastructure resilience property as debtor and identifying the infrastructure resilience property, shall have priority.  Any description of the infrastructure resilience property shall be sufficient if it refers to the financing order creating the infrastructure resilience property.  A copy of the financing statement shall be filed by the assignee with the commission, and the commission may require the assignor or the assignee to make other filings with respect to the transfer in accordance with procedures the commission may establish; provided that these filings shall not affect the perfection of the transfer. §   -8  Financing entity successor requirements; default of financing entity. (a)  Any successor to a public utility subject to a financing order, whether pursuant to any bankruptcy, reorganization, or other insolvency proceeding, or pursuant to any merger, sale, or transfer, by operation of law, or otherwise, shall be bound by the requirements of this chapter.  The successor of the public utility shall perform and satisfy all obligations of the public utility under the financing order in the same manner and to the same extent as the public utility, including the obligation to collect and pay the infrastructure resilience charge to any financing party as required by a financing order or any assignee.  Any successor to the public utility shall be entitled to receive any fixed recovery tax amounts otherwise payable to the public utility. (b) The commission may require in a financing order that, if a default by the public utility in remittance of the infrastructure resilience charge collected arising with respect to infrastructure resilience property occurs, the commission, without limiting any other remedies available to any financing party by reason of the default, shall order the sequestration and payment to the beneficiaries of the infrastructure resilience charge collected arising with respect to the infrastructure resilience property.  Any order shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any bankruptcy, reorganization, or other insolvency proceedings with respect to the public utility. §   -9  Severability.  If any provision of this chapter is held to be invalid or is superseded, replaced, repealed, or expires for any reason: (1)  That occurrence shall not affect any action allowed under this chapter that is taken prior to that occurrence by the commission, a financing entity, a bondholder, or any financing party, and any such action shall remain in full force and effect; and (2)  The validity and enforceability of the rest of this chapter shall remain unaffected."
