Section 1:
SB897 SD2 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 897 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO ENERGY. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: Section 1.  The legislature finds that it is imperative to enable the development of affordable clean energy resources for the benefit of utility customers in the State.  Many existing generating units in Hawaii will need to be retired in the next few years due to obsolescence and environmental permitting requirements.  The impending retirement of these units makes it urgent to obtain replacement resources, without which the reliability of electrical supplies in the State will be at risk.  In addition, continued reliance on these aging units, even if feasible, would result in increased costs for utility customers and continued reliance on fossil fuels, contrary to the State's policy to transition to renewable, non-carbon-emitting resources. The procurement of replacement clean energy resources by a certain investor-owned electric utility and its electric utility subsidiaries is ongoing in its stage 3 request for proposals and further anticipated in its first integrated grid planning request for proposals.  These requests for proposals implement energy plans that are developed through extensive engagement with local stakeholders and communities and reviewed and approved by the public utilities commission.  The legislature finds that successful procurement of clean energy resources is in the public interest and necessary to avoid significant detrimental reliability and affordability impacts to electric utility customers. The legislature also finds that the development of clean energy resources is essential to achieve the State's goals of one hundred per cent net electricity sales from renewable sources by 2045, a zero emissions economy by 2045, and greater energy security and energy diversification, as established by the Hawaii State Planning Act and existing public utility laws. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Establish the wildfire liability trust fund to be administered by the Hawaii electricity reliability administrator; (2)  Require the public utilities commission to: (A)  Contract for a Hawaii electricity reliability administrator; and (B)  Require payment of the Hawaii electricity reliability surcharge. SECTION 2. Chapter 269, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part     .  wildfire liability trust fund §269-A Definitions.  As used in this part: "Administrator" means the Hawaii electricity reliability administrator established under part IX. "Catastrophic wildfire" means a wildfire occurring in the State on or after the operation date that destroys more than five hundred commercial structures or residential structures designed for habitation. "Commission" means the public utilities commission. "Contributor" means a public utility that satisfies all requirements to participate in the wildfire liability trust fund. "Covered catastrophic wildfire" means a catastrophic wildfire that may have been caused, or whose severity may have been increased, by a contributor's facilities or actions.

(b) The governor shall appoint an advisor to the wildfire liability trust fund, who shall be exempt from chapter 76, and shall fix the executive director's compensation. (c) The executive director shall be responsible for the day-to-day operations and management of the fund and shall perform all functions necessary to implement this part, including entering into contracts and other obligations related to the operation, management, and administration of the fund, pursuant to the terms of the contract governing the administrator.  The executive director may be removed only by the terms of the contract establishing the administrator. §269-C  Eligibility for participation as a contributor; contributions.  (a)  To be eligible to participate as a contributor, a person or entity shall: (1)  Be a public utility that has a wildfire risk mitigation plan that has been approved or accepted by the commission; (2)  Notify the executive director, in the year before the person or entity becomes a contributor, that it intends to participate in the fund; and (3)  Agree to make an initial contribution, the payment of which shall be a binding commitment enforceable by the executive director. (b) The initial contributions from investor-owned electric utilities collectively shall be: (1)  $1,000,000,000 plus interest as provided in subsection (c) for amounts not securitized, which amounts shall be recovered from its customers in nonbypassable rates; and (2)  $500,000,000, which amount shall be funded by shareholders of those investor-owned electric utilities and used exclusively for the payment of salaries of the executive director and of all other persons retained by the executive director to implement this part, with any funds remaining as of 2035 to be transferred to the fund. (c)  An investor-owned electric utility may elect to make the initial contribution set forth in subsection (b)(1), to the degree not paid for through securitization, over a period not to exceed five years; provided that interest shall be added to any amounts paid after the first year, at an interest rate equal to the investor-owned electric utility's incremental cost of long‑term debt, with the interest recovered from customers in rates. (d) The executive director shall determine the initial contributions from other public utilities based on an actuarial assessment of the risk of potential payments by the fund resulting from covered catastrophic wildfires created by a public utility. (e) The executive director may propose supplemental contributions to the fund by participating public utilities or other entities involved in transmitting or distributing electric energy for sale to the public. (f) If a contributor fails to pay any part of an initial contribution or a supplemental contribution that the contributor agreed to make, or elects not to agree to make a supplemental contribution, that contributor shall no longer be a contributor as of the date on which the payment was due, and the contributor shall not receive any refund of payments previously made; provided that a contributor that elects not to make a supplemental contribution shall be a contributor as to any catastrophic wildfire that occurs before the election date.  After failing to, or electing not to, make a payment, a public utility may rejoin the fund as a contributor on a prospective basis if the public utility makes owed payments with interest. (g) The executive director shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 regarding the timing of initial and supplemental contributions, which may include upfront, annual, and retrospective payments, including payments made after a wildfire occurs. (h) Initial and supplemental contributions of investor‑owned electric utilities shall constitute wildfire recovery costs. §269-D  Determination of a covered catastrophic wildfire.  The executive director shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 regarding how to determine whether a wildfire is a covered catastrophic wildfire. The rules shall include a requirement that a wildfire shall be determined to be a covered catastrophic wildfire if a party makes non-frivolous allegations in a legal action that a contributor's facilities caused or contributed to the severity of a catastrophic wildfire. §269-E Replenishment of the wildfire liability trust fund.  (a) If the fund has made payments with respect to a covered catastrophic wildfire and after resolution of substantially all third-party liability claims that were brought or could be brought against contributors arising from that covered catastrophic wildfire, each contributor whose facilities were implicated in the covered catastrophic wildfire shall initiate a proceeding before the commission to review the prudence of the public utility's conduct leading to the catastrophic wildfire. (b) The commission shall determine whether the contributor acted prudently by: (1)  Considering only acts that may have caused the occurrence or contributed to the severity of the covered catastrophic wildfire; (2)  Evaluating the contributor's actions in the context of its overall systems, processes, and programs; (3)  Considering the recommendations of the executive director concerning the priority of wildfire risk mitigation capital expenditures, and the timeliness of contributor response; and (4)  Preventing a finding that any contributor action was prudent if it meets the standard of gross negligence. (c) If the commission determines that imprudent conduct by the contributor caused the occurrence or contributed to the severity of a covered catastrophic wildfire, the commission shall determine whether to order the contributor to replenish the fund in whole or in part for payments from the fund in connection with the catastrophic wildfire.  In determining the amount of replenishment, if any, the commission shall consider the extent and severity of the contributor's imprudence and factors within and beyond the contributor's control that may have led to or exacerbated the costs from the covered catastrophic wildfire, including but not limited to humidity, temperature, winds, fuel, merged wildfires with independent ignitions, third-party actions that affected the spread of the wildfire, and fire suppression activities. (d) For wildfire risk mitigation capital expenditures made by the executive director, the commission may determine whether to order the contributor to replenish the fund in whole or in part for payments from the fund in connection with the wildfire risk mitigation capital expenditures. (e) Over any three-year period, the commission shall not order the contributor to reimburse the fund in an amount that exceeds twenty per cent of the contributor's transmission and distribution equity rate base. (f) A contributor shall not recover in regulated rates any amount that the commission orders the contributor to pay to the fund as a replenishment under this section. §269-F Claims for payment by qualified claimants;  presentment requirement; wildfire risk mitigation capital expenditures by executive director.  (a) The executive director shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to create a process: (1)  Through which a qualified claimant that is not a government entity may submit to the fund a claim for payment of economic damages arising out of property damage resulting from a covered catastrophic wildfire, including a deadline to submit claims; and (2)  By which the executive director can use the fund to make wildfire risk mitigation capital expenditures. (b) A qualified claimant shall file a claim for payment for economic damages arising out of the loss of or damage to real or personal property from a covered catastrophic wildfire pursuant to this section.  The claim of a qualified claimant that is not a property insurer shall be limited to uninsured economic damages.  A qualified claimant shall not file or maintain a civil action against a contributor unless and until the qualified claimant rejects an offer of settlement from the fund.   A qualified claimant who fails to file a claim by the deadline established by the executive director pursuant to rule shall be ineligible to receive payment from the fund and shall be barred from instituting or maintaining any qualifying action against a contributor. (c) The executive director shall make an offer to settle each claim submitted, which the claimant may accept or reject.  In determining the amount of each offer, the executive director shall consider, at a minimum: (1)  The economic damages sought by all qualified claimants in the aggregate; (2)  The amount available to the fund relative to the amount under paragraph (1); (3)  The weight of any evidence of contributor liability; and (4)  The weight of any evidence of involvement of non‑contributor third-parties. (d) If the amount available to the fund, including assets held by the fund and all payments contributors are obligated to make to the fund, is less than fifty per cent of the aggregate liability limit as calculated in section 269-H, the fund shall make payment only to contributors pursuant to section 269-G. (e) Wildfire risk mitigation capital expenditures undertaken by the executive director shall be chosen to reduce urgent risks that substantially increase the likelihood or magnitude of qualifying damages in the event of a covered catastrophic wildfire; provided that the expenditures shall be approved by the commission and shall not exceed a level to prevent claims for payment before the fund can be replenished. §269-G Claims for payment by contributors; rules.  The executive director shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to create a process through which a contributor may obtain payment from the fund to satisfy settled or finally adjudicated claims for recovery of qualifying damages after exhausting the contributor's available insurance.  The rules shall establish the standard for approving any settlement. To the extent that the fund lacks sufficient funds to make a payment to a participating utility when sought, the fund shall make the payment upon receipt of contributions that contributors are obligated to make to the fund under payment schedules. §269-H Limitation on aggregate liability. (a)  The aggregate liability of all contributors for qualifying damages arising from a covered catastrophic wildfire, including economic and non-economic damages, shall not exceed the lesser of: (1)  $500,000,000; or (2)  The average assessed value of commercial structures and residential structures designed for habitation in the county in which the covered catastrophic wildfire occurred, multiplied by the number of commercial structures or residential structures designed for habitation that were destroyed, plus the value of personal property lost; or (3)  The aggregate assessed replacement value of commercial structures and residential structures designed for habitation in the county in which the covered catastrophic wildfire occurred, plus the value of personal property lost. (b) The following amounts shall be added to determine whether the aggregate liability limit has been reached: (1)  Payments from the fund pursuant to section 269-F; and (2)  Payments by a contributor in connection with any settlement or judgment on a claim for qualifying damages. (c) All civil actions arising out of a catastrophic wildfire shall be brought in the circuit in which the catastrophic wildfire occurred.  The court shall adopt procedures to equitably apply the limit set forth in subsection (a) to all filed civil claims.  All settlements or judgments for claims for qualifying damages shall be subject to approval by the court.  The court shall not approve any settlement or judgment that would cause the aggregate liability of contributors to exceed the aggregate liability limit. (d) A court shall consolidate cases arising from a covered catastrophic wildfire.  Any circuit court that is not the consolidating court shall transfer any civil case to facilitate the consolidation. §269-I Limitations on claims. (a)  No qualifying action may be instituted or maintained by a qualified claimant against contributors or their affiliates, employees, agents, or insurers if the qualified claimant accepts an offer under section 269-F; provided that the rights of a property insurer to bring an action as a subrogee of its policyholder shall not be affected by a property owner's or tenant's acceptance of an offer under section 269-F and the subrogation rights shall be affected only if the property insurer elects to accept an offer under section 269-F. (b) No suit, claim, arbitration, or other civil legal action for indemnity or contribution for amounts paid, or that may be paid, as a result of a covered catastrophic wildfire, shall be instituted or maintained by any persons or entities against contributors or their affiliates, employees, agents, or insurers for damages arising out of the loss of or damage to real or personal property from a covered catastrophic wildfire. §269-J Several liability.  Any law to the contrary notwithstanding, joint and several liability shall not apply to any qualifying damages; provided that, in any action to recover qualifying damages from a person or entity, the person or entity may claim, in defense, apportionment of fault to any other person or entity regardless of whether that person or entity is a party to the action. §269-K Reporting; refunds authorized by legislature.  (a) The executive director shall submit to the legislature an annual report regarding the fund no later than ninety days before the beginning of each regular session through 2034.  The annual report submitted by the executive director shall include an update on the activities of the fund. (b) No later than ninety days before the regular session of 2035, the executive director shall submit a report to the legislature regarding the financial status and resources of the fund relative to the then-current assessment of actuarial risk of a catastrophic wildfire. (c) Based on the report in subsection (b), the legislature may determine, based on recommendation by the executive director, that the fund is overfunded and direct the executive director to refund contributions, in whole or in part.  Any payments made to the fund that were recovered in regulated rates from customers, and any investment earnings associated with those payments, shall be refunded first. §269-L Admissibility of evidence. Any findings made or evidence submitted for purposes of proceedings under sections 269-D, 269-F, and 269-G shall be subject to the limits of admissibility under rule 408, Hawaii rules of evidence."

Raw Text:
SB897 SD2 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 897 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO ENERGY. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: Section 1.  The legislature finds that it is imperative to enable the development of affordable clean energy resources for the benefit of utility customers in the State.  Many existing generating units in Hawaii will need to be retired in the next few years due to obsolescence and environmental permitting requirements.  The impending retirement of these units makes it urgent to obtain replacement resources, without which the reliability of electrical supplies in the State will be at risk.  In addition, continued reliance on these aging units, even if feasible, would result in increased costs for utility customers and continued reliance on fossil fuels, contrary to the State's policy to transition to renewable, non-carbon-emitting resources. The procurement of replacement clean energy resources by a certain investor-owned electric utility and its electric utility subsidiaries is ongoing in its stage 3 request for proposals and further anticipated in its first integrated grid planning request for proposals.  These requests for proposals implement energy plans that are developed through extensive engagement with local stakeholders and communities and reviewed and approved by the public utilities commission.  The legislature finds that successful procurement of clean energy resources is in the public interest and necessary to avoid significant detrimental reliability and affordability impacts to electric utility customers. The legislature also finds that the development of clean energy resources is essential to achieve the State's goals of one hundred per cent net electricity sales from renewable sources by 2045, a zero emissions economy by 2045, and greater energy security and energy diversification, as established by the Hawaii State Planning Act and existing public utility laws. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Establish the wildfire liability trust fund to be administered by the Hawaii electricity reliability administrator; (2)  Require the public utilities commission to: (A)  Contract for a Hawaii electricity reliability administrator; and (B)  Require payment of the Hawaii electricity reliability surcharge. SECTION 2. Chapter 269, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part     .  wildfire liability trust fund §269-A Definitions.  As used in this part: "Administrator" means the Hawaii electricity reliability administrator established under part IX. "Catastrophic wildfire" means a wildfire occurring in the State on or after the operation date that destroys more than five hundred commercial structures or residential structures designed for habitation. "Commission" means the public utilities commission. "Contributor" means a public utility that satisfies all requirements to participate in the wildfire liability trust fund. "Covered catastrophic wildfire" means a catastrophic wildfire that may have been caused, or whose severity may have been increased, by a contributor's facilities or actions. "Electric utility" means a public utility that exists for the furnishing of electrical power. "Executive director" means the executive director of the wildfire liability trust fund under the administrator. "Fund" means the wildfire liability trust fund established pursuant to section 269-B. "Government entity" means any government agency, department, division, subdivision, unit, component, bureau, commission, office, board, or instrumentality of any kind, including federal, state, and municipal entities. "Investor-owned utility" means a public utility that is owned by shareholders and overseen by a board of directors elected by shareholders.

(b) The initial contributions from investor-owned electric utilities collectively shall be: (1)  $1,000,000,000 plus interest as provided in subsection (c) for amounts not securitized, which amounts shall be recovered from its customers in nonbypassable rates; and (2)  $500,000,000, which amount shall be funded by shareholders of those investor-owned electric utilities and used exclusively for the payment of salaries of the executive director and of all other persons retained by the executive director to implement this part, with any funds remaining as of 2035 to be transferred to the fund. (c)  An investor-owned electric utility may elect to make the initial contribution set forth in subsection (b)(1), to the degree not paid for through securitization, over a period not to exceed five years; provided that interest shall be added to any amounts paid after the first year, at an interest rate equal to the investor-owned electric utility's incremental cost of long‑term debt, with the interest recovered from customers in rates. (d) The executive director shall determine the initial contributions from other public utilities based on an actuarial assessment of the risk of potential payments by the fund resulting from covered catastrophic wildfires created by a public utility. (e) The executive director may propose supplemental contributions to the fund by participating public utilities or other entities involved in transmitting or distributing electric energy for sale to the public. (f) If a contributor fails to pay any part of an initial contribution or a supplemental contribution that the contributor agreed to make, or elects not to agree to make a supplemental contribution, that contributor shall no longer be a contributor as of the date on which the payment was due, and the contributor shall not receive any refund of payments previously made; provided that a contributor that elects not to make a supplemental contribution shall be a contributor as to any catastrophic wildfire that occurs before the election date.  After failing to, or electing not to, make a payment, a public utility may rejoin the fund as a contributor on a prospective basis if the public utility makes owed payments with interest. (g) The executive director shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 regarding the timing of initial and supplemental contributions, which may include upfront, annual, and retrospective payments, including payments made after a wildfire occurs. (h) Initial and supplemental contributions of investor‑owned electric utilities shall constitute wildfire recovery costs. §269-D  Determination of a covered catastrophic wildfire.  The executive director shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 regarding how to determine whether a wildfire is a covered catastrophic wildfire. The rules shall include a requirement that a wildfire shall be determined to be a covered catastrophic wildfire if a party makes non-frivolous allegations in a legal action that a contributor's facilities caused or contributed to the severity of a catastrophic wildfire. §269-E Replenishment of the wildfire liability trust fund.  (a) If the fund has made payments with respect to a covered catastrophic wildfire and after resolution of substantially all third-party liability claims that were brought or could be brought against contributors arising from that covered catastrophic wildfire, each contributor whose facilities were implicated in the covered catastrophic wildfire shall initiate a proceeding before the commission to review the prudence of the public utility's conduct leading to the catastrophic wildfire. (b) The commission shall determine whether the contributor acted prudently by: (1)  Considering only acts that may have caused the occurrence or contributed to the severity of the covered catastrophic wildfire; (2)  Evaluating the contributor's actions in the context of its overall systems, processes, and programs; (3)  Considering the recommendations of the executive director concerning the priority of wildfire risk mitigation capital expenditures, and the timeliness of contributor response; and (4)  Preventing a finding that any contributor action was prudent if it meets the standard of gross negligence. (c) If the commission determines that imprudent conduct by the contributor caused the occurrence or contributed to the severity of a covered catastrophic wildfire, the commission shall determine whether to order the contributor to replenish the fund in whole or in part for payments from the fund in connection with the catastrophic wildfire.  In determining the amount of replenishment, if any, the commission shall consider the extent and severity of the contributor's imprudence and factors within and beyond the contributor's control that may have led to or exacerbated the costs from the covered catastrophic wildfire, including but not limited to humidity, temperature, winds, fuel, merged wildfires with independent ignitions, third-party actions that affected the spread of the wildfire, and fire suppression activities. (d) For wildfire risk mitigation capital expenditures made by the executive director, the commission may determine whether to order the contributor to replenish the fund in whole or in part for payments from the fund in connection with the wildfire risk mitigation capital expenditures. (e) Over any three-year period, the commission shall not order the contributor to reimburse the fund in an amount that exceeds twenty per cent of the contributor's transmission and distribution equity rate base. (f) A contributor shall not recover in regulated rates any amount that the commission orders the contributor to pay to the fund as a replenishment under this section. §269-F Claims for payment by qualified claimants;  presentment requirement; wildfire risk mitigation capital expenditures by executive director.  (a) The executive director shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to create a process: (1)  Through which a qualified claimant that is not a government entity may submit to the fund a claim for payment of economic damages arising out of property damage resulting from a covered catastrophic wildfire, including a deadline to submit claims; and (2)  By which the executive director can use the fund to make wildfire risk mitigation capital expenditures. (b) A qualified claimant shall file a claim for payment for economic damages arising out of the loss of or damage to real or personal property from a covered catastrophic wildfire pursuant to this section.  The claim of a qualified claimant that is not a property insurer shall be limited to uninsured economic damages.  A qualified claimant shall not file or maintain a civil action against a contributor unless and until the qualified claimant rejects an offer of settlement from the fund.   A qualified claimant who fails to file a claim by the deadline established by the executive director pursuant to rule shall be ineligible to receive payment from the fund and shall be barred from instituting or maintaining any qualifying action against a contributor. (c) The executive director shall make an offer to settle each claim submitted, which the claimant may accept or reject.  In determining the amount of each offer, the executive director shall consider, at a minimum: (1)  The economic damages sought by all qualified claimants in the aggregate; (2)  The amount available to the fund relative to the amount under paragraph (1); (3)  The weight of any evidence of contributor liability; and (4)  The weight of any evidence of involvement of non‑contributor third-parties. (d) If the amount available to the fund, including assets held by the fund and all payments contributors are obligated to make to the fund, is less than fifty per cent of the aggregate liability limit as calculated in section 269-H, the fund shall make payment only to contributors pursuant to section 269-G. (e) Wildfire risk mitigation capital expenditures undertaken by the executive director shall be chosen to reduce urgent risks that substantially increase the likelihood or magnitude of qualifying damages in the event of a covered catastrophic wildfire; provided that the expenditures shall be approved by the commission and shall not exceed a level to prevent claims for payment before the fund can be replenished. §269-G Claims for payment by contributors; rules.  The executive director shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to create a process through which a contributor may obtain payment from the fund to satisfy settled or finally adjudicated claims for recovery of qualifying damages after exhausting the contributor's available insurance.  The rules shall establish the standard for approving any settlement. To the extent that the fund lacks sufficient funds to make a payment to a participating utility when sought, the fund shall make the payment upon receipt of contributions that contributors are obligated to make to the fund under payment schedules. §269-H Limitation on aggregate liability. (a)  The aggregate liability of all contributors for qualifying damages arising from a covered catastrophic wildfire, including economic and non-economic damages, shall not exceed the lesser of: (1)  $500,000,000; or (2)  The average assessed value of commercial structures and residential structures designed for habitation in the county in which the covered catastrophic wildfire occurred, multiplied by the number of commercial structures or residential structures designed for habitation that were destroyed, plus the value of personal property lost; or (3)  The aggregate assessed replacement value of commercial structures and residential structures designed for habitation in the county in which the covered catastrophic wildfire occurred, plus the value of personal property lost. (b) The following amounts shall be added to determine whether the aggregate liability limit has been reached: (1)  Payments from the fund pursuant to section 269-F; and (2)  Payments by a contributor in connection with any settlement or judgment on a claim for qualifying damages. (c) All civil actions arising out of a catastrophic wildfire shall be brought in the circuit in which the catastrophic wildfire occurred.  The court shall adopt procedures to equitably apply the limit set forth in subsection (a) to all filed civil claims.  All settlements or judgments for claims for qualifying damages shall be subject to approval by the court.  The court shall not approve any settlement or judgment that would cause the aggregate liability of contributors to exceed the aggregate liability limit. (d) A court shall consolidate cases arising from a covered catastrophic wildfire.  Any circuit court that is not the consolidating court shall transfer any civil case to facilitate the consolidation. §269-I Limitations on claims. (a)  No qualifying action may be instituted or maintained by a qualified claimant against contributors or their affiliates, employees, agents, or insurers if the qualified claimant accepts an offer under section 269-F; provided that the rights of a property insurer to bring an action as a subrogee of its policyholder shall not be affected by a property owner's or tenant's acceptance of an offer under section 269-F and the subrogation rights shall be affected only if the property insurer elects to accept an offer under section 269-F. (b) No suit, claim, arbitration, or other civil legal action for indemnity or contribution for amounts paid, or that may be paid, as a result of a covered catastrophic wildfire, shall be instituted or maintained by any persons or entities against contributors or their affiliates, employees, agents, or insurers for damages arising out of the loss of or damage to real or personal property from a covered catastrophic wildfire. §269-J Several liability.  Any law to the contrary notwithstanding, joint and several liability shall not apply to any qualifying damages; provided that, in any action to recover qualifying damages from a person or entity, the person or entity may claim, in defense, apportionment of fault to any other person or entity regardless of whether that person or entity is a party to the action. §269-K Reporting; refunds authorized by legislature.  (a) The executive director shall submit to the legislature an annual report regarding the fund no later than ninety days before the beginning of each regular session through 2034.  The annual report submitted by the executive director shall include an update on the activities of the fund. (b) No later than ninety days before the regular session of 2035, the executive director shall submit a report to the legislature regarding the financial status and resources of the fund relative to the then-current assessment of actuarial risk of a catastrophic wildfire. (c) Based on the report in subsection (b), the legislature may determine, based on recommendation by the executive director, that the fund is overfunded and direct the executive director to refund contributions, in whole or in part.  Any payments made to the fund that were recovered in regulated rates from customers, and any investment earnings associated with those payments, shall be refunded first. §269-L Admissibility of evidence. Any findings made or evidence submitted for purposes of proceedings under sections 269-D, 269-F, and 269-G shall be subject to the limits of admissibility under rule 408, Hawaii rules of evidence."
