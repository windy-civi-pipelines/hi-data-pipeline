Section 1:
SB234 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 234 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO AGRICULTURE. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii's climate, with a year-round growing season and ample rain in many areas, has several potential advantages for growing plant-based materials that can be processed into structural building materials.  For example, with sufficient water, there are types of clumping bamboo that can grow very rapidly and be processed into building materials that are stronger, more flexible, and lighter than timber or steel and can be made more fire- and termite-resistant than wood.  "Hempcrete" developed from industrial hemp can substitute for building blocks.  "Biocements" produced from cyanobacteria (blue-green algae or "pond scum") can substitute for Portland cement. The legislature further finds that these and other plant‑based building materials could bring green agriculture jobs to Hawaii and help the State meet its net negative carbon and greenhouse gas goals, as these plant‑based building materials sequester carbon, whereas production of traditional building materials such as timber, steel, and cement emit very large amounts of greenhouse gases. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish a working group to study how best to grow plants, develop plant-based building materials in Hawaii, and provide green jobs, while sequestering carbon and other greenhouse gases to help reach the State's climate target. SECTION 2. (a)  There is established a plant-based building materials working group to study how best to grow plants for development of plant-based building materials in Hawaii and provide green agricultural jobs while sequestering carbon and other greenhouse gases to help achieve the State's climate target. (b) The working group shall consist of the following: (1)  The dean and director of the university of Hawaii at Manoa college of tropical agriculture and human resources or their designee, who shall serve as chairperson; (2)  Four individuals who have expertise in growing or producing plant-based building materials, to be invited by the chairperson; (3)  The director of the university of Hawaii at Hilo college of agriculture, forestry, and natural resource management, or their designee; (4)  The chairperson of the board of agriculture, or their designee; (5)  The coordinator of the Hawaii climate change mitigation and adaptation commission; (6)  An expert in building materials, who the chairperson shall invite in consultation with the General Contractors Association of Hawaii; and (7)  Additional members with appropriate specialized expertise, as recommended by the members of the working group, at the discretion of the chairperson. (c) Members of the working group shall serve without compensation, but shall be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred, including travel expenses.  No member of the working group shall be made subject to chapter 84, Hawaii Revised Statutes, solely because of that member's participation as a member of the working group. (d) The working group shall submit a report of its findings and recommendations, and any proposed legislation, to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 2027. (e) The working group shall be dissolved on January 14, 2027. SECTION 3. This Act shall take effect upon its approval. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: Plant-Based Building Materials Working Group; Report Description: Establishes a Plant-Based Building Materials Working Group to study how best to grow plants, develop plant-based building materials in Hawaii, and provide economic development and green jobs while sequestering greenhouse gases to help achieve the State's climate target.  Requires a report to the legislature.
