SB1668 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1668 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT Relating to Electric Vehicle Infrastructure. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the State has one of the most aggressive clean energy goals in the nation and was the first to commit to a one hundred per cent renewable energy goal.  The State aims for a zero emissions clean energy economy "as quickly as practicable, but no later than 2045" with a fifty per cent reduction from 2005 levels by 2030 per Act 15, Session Laws of Hawaii 2018.  Hawaii was also the first state in the nation to declare a climate emergency through S.C.R. No. 44, S.D. 1, H.D. 1 (2021), which also called for a statewide commitment to a decarbonized economy.  To help achieve the State's renewable energy goals, Act 74, Session Laws of Hawaii 2021, requires one hundred per cent of the State's light-duty fleet to be fueled by renewable energy by the end of 2035. The legislature also finds that the use of fossil fuels is the primary source of greenhouse gas emissions in the State, contributing to climate change and posing a serious threat to the State's economic well-being, public health, infrastructure, environment, and way of life.  Of those emissions, the transportation sector is responsible for almost two-third of all petroleum imported and consumed in the State.  The legislature notes that for ground transportation, electric vehicles provide a viable, cost-effective alternative to vehicles that run on fossil fuels.  The legislature further finds that electric vehicles will play an integral role in Hawaii's clean energy future and in meeting the goals set for the State in reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, particularly as electrical generation in Hawaii transitions more completely to renewable energy sources. The legislature further finds that current charging facilities for electric vehicles do not meet Hawaii's needs and fall short of supporting the State's goal of zero emissions by 2045.  The State must accelerate a transition to cleaner transportation to reach its carbon emissions reduction goals.  Additionally, the legislature finds that as the State progresses toward a fully decarbonized economy, the challenges of addressing hard-to-decarbonize sectors will also increase.  To achieve the goal of a fully decarbonized economy, the State needs to plan ahead and understand the steps necessary to create a carbon-negative economy by 2045.  The legislature also finds that significant investment in clean energy technology and infrastructure will be required to achieve the State's goals of energy self-sufficiency, energy security, and energy diversification. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to facilitate the transition to one hundred per cent clean energy in the State by: (1)  Creating a funding program that incentivizes electric vehicle charging systems and infrastructure development; (2)  Increasing the amount of petroleum tax to be deposited into the electric vehicle charging system subaccount; and (3)  Allowing funds from the electric vehicle charging system subaccount to be expended for the funding program. SECTION 2.  Chapter 269, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding two new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§269-A Electric vehicle charging systems and infrastructure; funding program.  (a) The public utilities commission shall administer a funding program that incentivizes the installation, maintenance, and upgrade of electric vehicle charging systems and infrastructure throughout the State to achieve and maintain a zero emissions clean energy economy. The public utilities commission may contract with a third-party administrator pursuant to section 269-B to operate and manage the funding program. (b)  Funding shall be made available to applicants for the purposes of developing, maintaining, and upgrading electric vehicle charging systems, infrastructure, related technologies, and related grid services. (c)  Funding shall be subject to availability, and the program administrator shall not approve additional funding for the remainder of the fiscal year after program funds have been fully exhausted. (d)  The public utilities commission, or its designated program administrator shall: (1)  Prepare any forms that may be necessary for an applicant to claim funding pursuant to this section; and (2)  Require each applicant to furnish reasonable information to ascertain the validity of the claim, including but not limited to documentation necessary to demonstrate that the installation, maintenance, and upgrade for which the funding is claimed is eligible. (e)  In administering the funding program, the public utilities commission shall give consideration to the following guidelines: (1)  Priority shall be given to electric vehicle charging systems that are publicly available; serve multiple tenants, employees, or customers; serve electric vehicle fleets; support the visitor industry in transitioning to clean transportation; or serve low‑income, moderate-income, underserved, or environmental justice communities; (2)  Funding shall enhance broader public clean energy and grid resiliency goals by supporting deployment of electric vehicle charging systems that can regulate their time of use, be networked and co-optimized with other electric vehicle charging systems and clean transportation options, and otherwise provide grid services or other benefits to the utility and electric grid; and (3)  The program administrator may propose new or modified guidelines to be considered in addition to those specified in this subsection and may make programmatic adjustments due to market changes, technological advancements, and levels of participation to ensure the prudent use of taxpayer funds to effectively manage the program budget. (f)  Eligible applicants receiving funds through the funding program shall at minimum: (1)  State the name of the applicant requesting program funds; (2)  State the amount of program funds being requested; and (3)  Describe the electric vehicle charging system or infrastructure to be installed, maintained, or upgraded. (g)  Eligible applicants may be eligible for program funding if the funds are used to: (1)  Install a new vehicle charging system or infrastructure where none previously existed to: (A)  An alternating current Level 2 station with one port; (B)  An alternating current Level 2 station with one or more ports that provide electricity to one or more electric vehicles; or (C)  A direct current fast charging system; or (2)  Upgrade an existing electric vehicle charging system or infrastructure to: (A)  An alternating current Level 2 station with one port; (B)  An alternating current Level 2 station with one or more ports that provide electricity to one or more electric vehicles; or (C)  A direct current fast charging station. (h)  Eligible applicants receiving funds through the funding program shall use funds in accordance with the requirements of this section.  Installations funded by the funding program shall be performed by experienced and qualified persons. (i)  Eligible applicants receiving funds through the funding program shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws prohibiting discrimination against any person on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, creed, sex, age, sexual orientation, or disability, or any other characteristic protected under applicable law.
