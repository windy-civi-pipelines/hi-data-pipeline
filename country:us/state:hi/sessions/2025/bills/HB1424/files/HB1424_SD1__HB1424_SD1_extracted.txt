Section 1:
HB1424 SD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1424 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII S.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO APPROPRIATIONS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that for fiscal year 2025, the executive branch had requested about $3,600,000,000 in funding for more than forty-seven thousand permanent and three thousand six hundred temporary authorized positions.  The amount requested accounted for more than twenty per cent of all authorized funds in fiscal year 2025. The legislature further finds that there has been a high vacancy rate in public employment positions and funds appropriated for these positions are either transferred or used for purposes that are not consistent with the purpose for which the appropriation was authorized.  A vacancy report from December 2024 from the department of human resources development identified four thousand eighty-five vacancies, or about twenty-four per cent of civil service positions, in the State. The purpose of this Act is to increase legislative oversight to ensure that funds appropriated by the legislature are used for their intended purpose by requiring a report to the legislature upon the approval of the transfer of funds appropriated for positions to operating expenses, and vice versa. SECTION 2.  Chapter 37, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§37-    Transfers of funds; positions; operating expenses; report.  The director of finance shall submit a report to the legislature upon approving the transfer of funds for: (1)  Positions to operating expenses; or (2)  Operating expenses to fund positions for any state department or agency." SECTION 3.  New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 3000. Report Title: BUF; Budget; Appropriations; Reports Description: Requires the Director of Finance to report to the Legislature after approving the transfer of funds appropriated for positions to operating expenses, and vice versa. Effective 7/1/3000.  (SD1) The summary description of legislation appearing on this page is for informational purposes only and is not legislation or evidence of legislative intent.
