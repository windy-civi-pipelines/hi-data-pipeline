This is to inform you that on May 29, 2025, the following bill was signed into law:
H.B. NO. 1291, H.D. 2, RELATING TO AGRICULTURE.

THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO AGRICULTURE.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that coffee is the
2 State's second most lucrative agricultural crop, valued by the
3 United States Department of Agriculture at up to $64,300,000
4 annually, with additional upstream and downstream impacts that
5 include employment, land preservation, and tourism.
6 The legislature further finds that Hawaii-grown coffee is
7 among the highest priced coffee sold anywhere in the world,
8 largely due to the high cost of production and its reputation
9 for outstanding quality. As such, the State's coffee industry
10 is susceptible to fraud when less expensive coffees are falsely
11 labeled as originating from Hawaii. Currently, state law
12 imposes penalties for the false labeling (counterfeiting) of
13 Hawaii-grown coffee in cherry and parchment form, but the fraud
14 of coffee counterfeiting has been almost exclusively committed
15 in roasted coffee products. Coffee counterfeiting undermines
16 Hawaii's coffee farmers by misrepresenting an increase in
17 supply, thereby creating downward price pressure and value

C.D. 1
1 depreciation in the marketplace. Additionally, further harm
2 occurs when inferior products are introduced into the supply
3 chain, thereby undermining Hawaii’s hard-fought brand identity
4 for high quality crops.
5 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to deter coffee
6 counterfeiting by expanding the offense of false labeling of
7 Hawaii-grown coffee to include roasted coffee and enhancing the
8 penalties for the false labeling of Hawaii-grown coffee with
9 regard to its geographic origin through the imposition of a
10 mandatory minimum fine and specification that each act of false
II labeling is a distinct and separate offense.
12 SECTION 2. Section 708-871.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
13 amended to read as follows:
14 " [-F]§708-871.5[-3-] False labeling of Hawaii-grown coffee.
15 (1) A person commits the offense of false labeling of
16 Hawaii-grown coffee if the person knowingly transports,
17 distributes, advertises, sells, or possesses with the intent to
18 sell Hawaii-grown green coffee, cherry coffee, [er^] parchment
19 coffee, or roasted coffee that is falsely labeled with regard to
20 the geographic origin of the Hawaii-grown coffee.
21 (2) For the purposes of this section:
