SR78 THE SENATE S.R. NO. 78 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII SENATE RESOLUTION requesting the county of maui to study the feasibility of implementing a universal basic income program for residents and BUSINESS owners impacted by the 2023 Maui wildfires. WHEREAS, the 2023 Maui wildfires caused extensive damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure, the effects of which continue to displace thousands of residents and disrupt the local economy two years later; and WHEREAS, evidence from past wildfire recovery efforts, including the My People Fund initiative in Tennessee following the 2016 Gatlinburg wildfires, demonstrate that direct financial assistance to those impacted contributes significantly to economic stability, reduces financial strain, and improves long-term recovery outcomes; and WHEREAS, by giving checks directly to impacted families at regular intervals over the course of six months, the My People Fund initiative essentially acted as a universal basic income (UBI), which is a social welfare program that provides a regular cash payment to all citizens of a given population without work requirements or regard to their income and wealth; and WHEREAS, the checks led to positive impacts on housing security, financial well-being, and emotional health, as highlighted in the program's evaluation; and WHEREAS, research indicates that direct cash assistance programs empower recipients by affording them the flexibility to address their most pressing needs, including housing, medical expenses, childcare, and business recovery; and WHEREAS, the projected long-term economic effects of the 2023 Maui wildfires on the county, including increased housing instability, loss of employment, and declining tourism revenue, warrant proactive measures to support affected residents and businesses; and WHEREAS, implementing a UBI program in the County of Maui, modeled after previous successful direct assistance programs, would establish a financial safety net and foster economic resilience during the extended recovery process; and WHEREAS, given the ongoing public support as the recovery period continues, the County of Maui is uniquely positioned to explore funding mechanisms for a UBI program, including federal disaster aid, state grants, public-private partnerships, and philanthropic contributions; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, that the County of Maui is requested to study the feasibility of implementing a Universal Basic Income Program for residents and business owners impacted by the 2023 Maui wildfires; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the County of Maui is requested to consider in the study factors including eligibility criteria, funding sources, economic impact, and potential partnerships with nonprofit organizations and research institutions; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the County of Maui is requested to submit a report of its findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, to the Legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2026; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Governor, Director of Human Services, Mayor of the County of Maui, and Chair of Maui County Council.
