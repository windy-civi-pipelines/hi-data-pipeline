HB1116 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1116 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO HEALTH. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States and in Hawaii.  Tobacco use is a serious public health problem in terms of the human suffering and loss of life it causes, as well as the financial burden it imposes on society and our healthcare system.  According to calculations based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2014 "Best Practices for Comprehensive Tobacco Control Programs" guide, $611,000,000 in health care costs are directly attributed to smoking in Hawaii. Furthermore, in a 2016 report titled "E-Cigarette Use Among Youth and Young Adults" (2016 E-Cigarette Use report), the United States Surgeon General explained that ninety-five per cent of all smokers start smoking before the age of twenty-one.  A 2017 study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that eighty-one per cent of youth who ever used a tobacco product report that the first product they used was flavored.  Flavored tobacco products promote youth initiation to tobacco use and push young occasional smokers to become daily smokers by reducing or masking the natural harshness and taste of tobacco smoke, thereby increasing the appeal of tobacco products. Menthol is used by the tobacco industry because it has a cooling and numbing effect and can reduce the throat irritation caused by smoking, thus making menthol cigarettes an appealing option for youth who are initiating tobacco use.  According to the 2022 National Youth Tobacco Survey, forty per cent of youth who used a flavored tobacco product reported using a menthol-flavored tobacco product. Candy and fruit flavors improve the taste and reduce the harshness of tobacco products, making them more appealing and easier for beginners to try tobacco products and ultimately become addicted to nicotine.  The popularity of electronic cigarettes among youth is concerning.  The combination of enticing flavors and nicotine salts allows higher levels of nicotine to be inhaled with less irritation.  In the 2016 E-Cigarette Use report, the United States Surgeon General stated that, "compared with older adults, the brain of the youth and young adults is more vulnerable to the negative consequences of nicotine exposure.  The effects include addiction, priming for use of other addictive substances, reduced impulse control, deficits in attention and cognition, and mood disorders." While there has been a significant decline in the use of combustible cigarettes over the last decade, there has been a dramatic increase in the use of electronic smoking devices by Hawaii's youth.  Vaping in Hawaii is at an epidemic level.  According to the 2011 and 2015 Hawaii Youth Tobacco Survey, during these four years, the proportion of youth experimenting with electronic smoking devices increased six-fold among middle school youth and four-fold among high school youth.  According to the 2021 Hawaii Youth Risk Behavior Survey, thirteen per cent of middle school and thirty-two per cent of public high school students had tried electronic smoking devices.  The 2021 Hawaii Youth Risk Behavior Survey also indicates that seven per cent of middle school and fifteen per cent of high school students currently vape.  The 2021 Hawaii Youth Risk Behavior Survey also shows the prevalence is higher in the neighbor island counties with high school vaping at twenty-two per cent for the county of Hawaii, eighteen per cent in the county of Maui, and sixteen per cent in the county of Kauai.  The elevated use of electronic smoking devices has led to a significant rise in youth nicotine addiction. Furthermore, while the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, P.L. 111-31 (Tobacco Control Act), prohibited characterizing flavors, including fruit and candy flavorings, in cigarettes, it did not ban menthol in cigarettes or the use of characterizing flavors in other tobacco products.  The Tobacco Control Act provided the United States Food and Drug Administration with the authority to regulate cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco, and smokeless tobacco, but required the Food and Drug Administration to undertake an extensive rulemaking process to extend its regulatory authority to include electronic smoking devices.  Delays in the regulatory process allowed the tobacco industry and electronic smoking device industry to significantly increase the introduction of and extensively market flavored non-cigarette tobacco products, especially in electronic smoking devices.  It is no coincidence that the number of electronic cigarette flavors have skyrocketed in recent years.  In a 2018 study published in The Journal of Medical Internet Research, the count of flavor labels was reported to have more than doubled from 7,776 in 2013-2014 to 15,586 in 2016-2017.  Hawaii has experienced the heightened promotion of vape products that offer candy and local flavors designed to appeal to Hawaii's youth, such as orange soda, apple mui, Kona coffee, Maui mango, shaka strawberry, lychee ice, and Molokai hot bread.  Additionally, many of the packages are designed to look like candies popular with children, such as Jolly Ranchers and Sour Patch Kids. Current surveillance data show that menthol cigarette smoking is high among the general population in Hawaii with further gender and racial disparities.  According to the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, sixty-four per cent of adult smokers in Hawaii usually smoke menthol cigarettes.  The 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System also shows that prevalence is high among specific ethnic groups with seventy-one per cent of Filipinos, eighty-one per cent of Native Hawaiians, and sixty-seven per cent of Japanese usually smoking menthol cigarettes.  The 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System also shows that female smokers in Hawaii smoke menthol cigarettes at higher rates than men, seventy-two per cent versus fifty-eight per cent, comparatively. In response to California banning flavored e-cigarettes and menthol cigarettes in 2022, the tobacco industry developed a new way to replace the menthol flavor and market these new products as "non-menthol" products.  These products contain a new synthetic agent, which purports to create a cooling sensation similar to menthol without using menthol and menthol's characteristically minty odor.  These products can facilitate smoking initiation, similar to menthol, as they are marketed to impart cooling sensations in users.  Following the California flavored tobacco legislation, the tobacco industry also developed tobacco product flavor enhancers, or products designed and sold to create a flavor when added to a tobacco product. These products would provide the option to add flavors into a tobacco product and could continue to be marketed to users and appeal to youth. Given the significant threat to public health posed by flavored tobacco products, including those with menthol and those that produce cooling sensations, five states, including Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and California, and three hundred ninety-five localities have enacted laws prohibiting the sale of flavored tobacco products, according to the 2024 Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids States and Localities Report. These laws now protect over twenty-five per cent of the United States population.  The legislature finds that Hawaii should also take steps to regulate these products to reduce tobacco-related health disparities and address the youth vaping epidemic. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to prohibit the sale or distribution in Hawaii of all flavored tobacco products, including products with menthol and products that produce cooling sensations, and prohibit the mislabeling of products as nicotine-free. SECTION 2.  Chapter 321, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "PART .  SALE OF FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS §321-A  Definitions.  As used in this part, unless the context otherwise requires: "Cigarette" has the same meaning as in section 245-1.
