STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS TO SENATE BILL NO. 583
Honorable Members
Thirty-Third Legislature
State of Hawaii
Pursuant to Section 16 of Article III of the Constitution of the State of
Hawaii, I am returning herewith, without my approval. Senate Bill No. 583, entitled "A
Bill for an Act Relating to Naming Rights."
The purposes of this bill are to allow the Stadium Authority to lease the
naming rights for the stadium facility: to allow the Hawaii Tourism Authority to lease the
naming rights for the Convention Center; to exempt the stadium facility and Convention
Center from chapter 102, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS), Concessions on Public
Property, to require that revenues derived from advertising and marketing in the stadium
facility and Convention Center be deposited to the Stadium Development Special Fund
and Convention Center Enterprise Special Fund, respectively: to amend sections 109-

Section 2:
3.5 and 201B-8, HRS, specifying sources of revenue that must be deposited to the
Stadium Development Special Fund and Convention Center Enterprise Special Fund,
respectively; and to permit advertising on the outside of any stadium operated by the
stadium authority with the name of any entity that leased the naming rights of the
stadium from the stadium authority.
This bill is objectionable because the exceptions from chapter 102, which
regulates bidding for concessions contracts, may likely be determined by a court to
violate the single subject requirement of section 14 of article ill of the State Constitution,
which provides, in part: "Each law shall embrace but one subject, which shall be
expressed in its title." The one subject expressed in this bill’s title is "naming rights."
Accordingly, the inclusion of exemptions relating to concessions contracts from chapter
102, HRS, in this bill expose it to constitutional challenge.

The purposes of this bill are to allow the Stadium Authority to lease the

Stadium Development Special Fund and Convention Center Enterprise Special Fund,
respectively; and to permit advertising on the outside of any stadium operated by the
