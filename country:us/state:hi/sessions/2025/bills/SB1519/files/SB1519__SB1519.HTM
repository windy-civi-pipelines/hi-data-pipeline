SB1519 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1519 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to prior authorization. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that prior authorization is a process where a health care provider must get approval from a health insurance plan before providing certain medical services or prescriptions to a patient, ensuring that the treatment is deemed medically necessary and covered by the patient's health insurance plan.  Prior authorization helps avoid unsafe or unnecessary treatments, lowers risk of harmful drug interactions, cuts out-of-pocket costs for patients, and confines health insurers' expenses to health care treatments deemed medically necessary.  However, prior authorization in the State has become increasingly complex and opaque, causing delays in patient care, increasing administrative burdens, and eroding public trust in the health care system, as the process places cost saving ahead of optimal patient care. The legislature further finds that lawmakers at the state and federal levels have similarly recognized the need for prior authorization reform.  In 2023, nine states and Washington, D.C. enacted measures to reform the prior authorization process in their jurisdictions.  Further, in 2024, more than ninety bills have been introduced in legislatures across thirty states.  New Jersey, Tennessee, and Washington D.C. have recently enacted comprehensive prior authorization reform laws, which will generally increase transparency and improve administrative efficiency around the prior authorization process and align clinical criteria used in making prior authorization determinations to nationally recognized standards. The legislature believes that patient-physician relationship is paramount and should not be subject to third-party intrusion.  Furthermore, prior authorization shall not ge permitted to hinder patient care or intrude on the practice of medicine. Therefore, prior authorization must be used judiciously, efficiently, and in a manner that prevents cost-shifting onto patients, physicians, and other health care providers. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for the prior authorization process in the State. SECTION 2.
