STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO FUNDING ADJUSTMENTS FOR STATE PROGRAMS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 PART I
2 SECTION 1. This Act is recommended by the governor for
3 immediate passage in accordance with section 9 of article VII of
4 the Constitution of the State of Hawaii.
5 SECTION 2. In prior years, the respective budget acts
6 contained budget special provisions similar to sections 50, 51,
7 72, and 81 of Act 88, Session Laws of Hawaii 2021, the General
8 Appropriations Act of 2021, which permitted departments to
9 transfer funds between their projects; permitted departments to
10 transfer funds between their programs, provided that the
11 legislature was informed of the transfers; and established a
12 protocol fund as a separate account to be expended at the
13 discretion of the executive head of departments or agencies.
14 However, Act 164, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023, the General
15 Appropriations Act of 2023, (Act 164), as amended by Act 230,
16 Session Laws of Hawaii 2024, the Supplemental Appropriations Act
17 of 2024, does not include the special provisions. Consequently,

C.D. 1
1 although funds were appropriated to various state departments
2 for their capital improvement program projects for fiscal
3 biennium 2023-2025, the omission of the special provisions has
4 caused operational limitations by limiting the ability of
5 departments to supplement allotments and transfer funds between
6 projects to address changing conditions.
7 PART II
8 SECTION 3. The purpose of this part is to address the
9 omission of the special provisions that authorize supplemental
10 allotments and transfer of unrequired balances for capital
11 improvement program projects and that also establish a protocol
12 fund as a separate account to be expended at the discretion of
13 the executive head of departments in Act 164.
14 SECTION 4. Part VII of Act 164, Session Laws of Hawaii
15 2023, as amended by Act 230, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024, is
16 amended by adding a new section to read as follows:
17 "SECTION 15.2. If the authorized appropriations specified
18 for capital improvement projects listed in this Act are
19 insufficient and where the source of funding is designated as
20 special funds, general obligation bond fund with debt service
21 cost to be paid from special funds, revenue bond funds, or

1 revolving funds, the governor may make supplemental allotments
2 from the special fund or revolving fund responsible for cash or
3 debt service payments for the projects or transfer unrequired
4 balances from other unlapsed projects in this Act or prior
5 appropriation acts that authorized the use of special funds,
6 general obligation bond fund with debt service costs to be paid
7 from special funds, revenue bond funds, or revolving funds;
8 provided that the supplemental allotments shall not be used to
9 increase the scope of the project; provided further that the
10 supplemental allotments shall not impair the ability of the fund
11 to meet the purposes for which it was established."
12 SECTION 5. Part VII of Act 164, Session Laws of Hawaii
13 2023, as amended by Act 230, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024, is
14 amended by adding a new section to read as follows:
15 "SECTION 15.3. If the authorized appropriations specified
16 for capital improvement projects listed in this Act are
17 insufficient and where the source of funding is designated as
18 airport passenger facility charge funds, the governor may make
19 supplemental allotments from the airport revenue fund or airport
20 revenue bond funds, or transfer unrequired balances from other
21 unlapsed projects in this Act or prior appropriation acts that

5 to meet the purposes for which it was established; provided
6 further that the governor, at the governor's discretion, may
7 increase the passenger facility charge fund authorization
8 ceiling for the program to accommodate the expenditure of the
9 funds."
10 SECTION 6. Part VII of Act 164, Session Laws of Hawaii
11 2023, as amended by Act 230, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024, is
12 amended by adding a new section to read as follows:
13 "SECTION 15.4. Of the respective operating appropriation
14 authorized in part II of this Act for each principal state
15 department as defined by section 26-4, Hawaii Revised Statutes,
16 the sum of $7,000 in fiscal year 2024-2025 shall be made
17 available in each department to be established as a separate
18 account for a protocol fund to be expended at the discretion of
19 the executive head of the department (i.e., director,
20 chairperson, comptroller, adjutant general, superintendent,
21 president, or attorney general)."
