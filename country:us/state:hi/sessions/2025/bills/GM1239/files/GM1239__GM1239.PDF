THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO SCHOOL MEALS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that Hawaii's working
2 families face significant economic challenges, including the
3 rising cost of living, inflation, and limited affordable options
4 for basic needs. Access to nutritious meals is essential for
5 the overall well-being of Hawaii's people. Further, for
6 students, access to healthy meals is critical to academic
7 success and achievement. However, for some students, school
8 meals m.ay be their only consistent source of food.
9 The legislature also finds that Aloha United Way released
10 the asset limited, income constrained, employed (ALICE) report
11 in January 2025, which identified that, while twelve per cent of
12 households in the State are below the poverty line, twenty-nine
13 per cent are identified as ALICE households. ALICE, households
14 are defined as households with incomes above the federal poverty
15 level but continue to struggle with the bare-minimum costs of
16 basic necessities such as housing, childcare, food,
17 transportation, health care, and a smartphone plan, plus taxes.

C.D. 1
1 The report also found that forty-six per cent of ALICE
2 households experience consistent food insecurity.
3 The legislature further finds that subsidizing the meal
4 costs for students whose family income is not more than three
5 hundred per cent of the federal poverty level will have the
6 benefit of providing support to families in need. Additionally,
7 subsidized meal costs for these students will allow students to
8 focus on their academic careers, extracurricular activities, and
9 life goals. Meal subsidies at department of education schools
10 will allow more students to achieve a high-quality education
11 while ensuring adequate nutrition for physical development and
12 mental well-being.
13 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
14 (1) Beginning with the 2025-2026 school year, expand free
15 school meal coverage to students who currently qualify
16 for reduced-price lunch;
17 (2) Beginning with the 2026-2027 school year, expand free
18 school meal coverage to students whose family income
19 is not more than three hundred per cent of the federal
20 poverty level; and

1 (3) Appropriate funds to the department of education to
2 subsidize meal costs for students eligible for reduced
3 priced-meals and whose family income is not more than
4 three hundred per cent of the federal poverty level.
5 SECTION 2. Section 302A-404, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
6 amended to read as follows:
7 ’'§302A-404 School meals. (a) School meals shall be made
8 available under the school meals program in every school where
9 the students are required to eat meals at school.
10 (b) Beginning with the 2025-2026 school year, students who
11 qualify for reduced-price meals under the National School Lunch
12 Program shall receive free school meals.
13 (c) Beginning with the 2026-2027 school year, free school
14 meals shall be provided to every student enrolled in a
15 department school whose family income is not more than three
16 hundred per cent of the federal poverty level, regardless of a
17 student's eligibility for participation in the federal school
18 meals program.
19 [-(tel-] (d) No student shall be denied a meal solely for
20 failure to pay[-h

8 a negative fund balance; provided that no rule or policy shall
9 prohibit feeding a student [as requirod pursuant to subsGction
10 ■fb) . ] or otherwise conflict with subsection (d) .
II (f) It is the intent of this section not to jeopardize the
12 receipt of any federal aid and, only to the extent necessary to
13 effectuate this intent, the governor may modify strict
14 provisions of this section, but shall promptly report any
15 modification with the governor's reasons therefore to the next
16 succeeding session of the legislature for review."
17 SECTION 3. There is appropriated out of the general
18 revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $565,000 or so much
19 thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the
