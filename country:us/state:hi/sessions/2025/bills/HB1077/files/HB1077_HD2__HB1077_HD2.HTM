Section 1:
HB1077 HD2 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1077 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii is experiencing a climate emergency.  The effects of climate change, such as rising temperatures, prolonged droughts, and increasingly destructive and deadly weather events, are felt across the island chain.  These impacts threaten not only our vibrant ecosystems but, as actors within these ecosystems, the people of Hawaii as well.  To ensure the health, safety, and well-being of Hawaii's lands, waters, and people, successful mitigation of and adaptation to climate change are imperative. The legislature further finds that given the scale and impact of the climate emergency, the State must invest in bold actions to prepare for, mitigate, and adapt to climate change, including resiliency to intensifying natural disasters. The legislature further finds that economic development, in particular, must consider climate change.  Tourism, infrastructure, and community development are all predicated upon Hawaii's land and natural resources.  Resiliency to and mitigation of climate change must remain at the forefront of any economic development or revitalization project. The legislature further finds that Hawaii needs to invest in efforts to reduce climate change impacts now to limit current and future costs of climate change. The anticipated extent of the impact of climate change is such that state government needs to take comprehensive and coordinated mitigation efforts as soon as possible. The purpose of this Act is to increase the transient accommodations tax and allocate a portion of the tax to the general fund for projects that address climate change impacts and advance economic development and revitalization. SECTION 2. Section 237D-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§237D-2  Imposition and rates.  (a)  There is levied and shall be assessed and collected each month a tax of: (1)  Five per cent for the period beginning on January 1, 1987, to June 30, 1994; (2)  Six per cent for the period beginning on July 1, 1994, to December 31, 1998; (3)  7.25 per cent for the period beginning on January 1, 1999, to June 30, 2009; (4)  8.25 per cent for the period beginning on July 1, 2009, to June 30, 2010; [and] (5)  9.25 per cent for the period beginning on July 1, 2010, [and thereafter;] to December 31, 2025; and (6)  11 per cent for the period beginning on January 1, 2026, and thereafter; on the gross rental or gross rental proceeds derived from furnishing transient accommodations.
