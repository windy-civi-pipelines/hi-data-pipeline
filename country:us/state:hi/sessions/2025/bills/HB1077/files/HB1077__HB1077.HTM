HB1077 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1077 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii is experiencing a climate emergency.  The effects of climate change, such as rising temperatures, prolonged droughts, and increasingly destructive and deadly weather events, are felt across the island chain.  These impacts threaten not only our vibrant ecosystems but, as actors within these ecosystems, the people of Hawaii as well.  To ensure the health, safety, and wellbeing of Hawaii's lands, waters, and people, successful mitigation of and adaptation to climate change is imperative. The legislature further finds that given the scale and impact of the climate emergency, the State must invest in bold actions to prepare for, mitigate, and adapt to climate change, including resiliency to intensifying natural disasters. A coordinated approach is necessary, and the department of defense, charged with protecting the safety and welfare of the people of Hawaii and the State's lead for hazard mitigation and disaster readiness, is prepared to assume this responsibility, in coordination with the departments of business, economic development, and tourism; land and natural resources; and transportation, as well as the community, to provide for the safety, security, and wellbeing of Hawaii's places and people. The legislature further finds that economic development, in particular, must consider climate change.  Tourism, infrastructure, and community development are all predicated upon Hawaii's land and natural resources.  Resiliency to and mitigation of climate change must remain at the forefront of any economic development or revitalization project. The legislature further finds that Hawaii needs to invest in efforts to reduce climate change impacts now to limit current and future costs of climate change. The anticipated extent of the impact of climate change is such that state government needs to take comprehensive and coordinated mitigation efforts as soon as possible. The purposes of this Act are to: (1)  Address the impacts of climate change on the State and mitigate further impacts by authorizing the funding of resiliency projects and establishing the climate mitigation and resiliency special fund; (2)  Support resilient economic development and revitalization throughout the state by establishing the economic development and revitalization special fund; (3)  Increase the transient accommodations tax and allocate a portion of the tax to the two newly established special funds; and (4)  Appropriate funds into and out of the special funds.
