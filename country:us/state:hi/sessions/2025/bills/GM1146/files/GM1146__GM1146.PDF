THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE. 2025 K S.D. 2
STATE OF HAWAII ’ ' ‘ H.D. 3
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO MEDICAL CANNABIS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that existing state law
2 recognizes the beneficial use of cannabis in treating certain
3 debilitating medical conditions, their symptoms, and certain
4 side effects of treatment of these conditions, including severe
5 pain, nausea, muscle spasms, and seizures. Act 241, Session
6 Laws of Hawaii 2015 (Act 241), provided patient access to
7 medical cannabis beyond the access that existed before the
8 creation of the dispensary system authorized by Act 241.
9 However, the intent of the legislature as expressed in Act 241
10 was, and continues to be, to expand qualifying patients' access
11 to cannabis rather than to replace existing access routes.
12 According to the rapid survey of Hawaii medical cannabis
13 patients and providers conducted by the department of health in
14 2022, fifty-five per cent of patients indicated that they
15 obtained their cannabis exclusively from a licensed medical
16 cannabis dispensary. This means that up to forty-five per cent
17 of patients obtain their cannabis for medical use from other

1 sources, including cultivation. Part of the justification for
2 establishing the medical cannabis dispensary system was that
3 some patients may not be able to grow their own supply of
4 medical cannabis due to certain limitations, such as disability
5 or lack of space. These patients should continue to have
6 multiple options for obtaining medical cannabis, including
7 having a primary caregiver grow an adequate supply of cannabis
8 for medical use on their behalf.
9 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to maintain and
10 clarify the multiple options currently available for qualifying
11 patients to access a safe and legal supply of medical cannabis.
12 SECTION 2. Chapter 329, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
13 amended by adding a new section to part IX to be appropriately
14 designated and to read as follows:
IS "§329- Violations; penalties. (a) In addition to any
16 other penalties allowed by law, any person who violates this
17 part or rules adopted pursuant to this part shall be fined not
18 more than $5,000 for each separate violation. Each day on which
19 a violation occurs or continues shall constitute a separate
20 offense.

C.D. 1
1 (b) The department of health may impose an administrative
2 penalty on a person pursuant to subsection (a) or rules adopted
3 pursuant to this part. The department of health shall serve the
4 person with written notice of the administrative penalty and the
5 basis for the administrative penalty. Any notice of an
6 administrative penalty may be accompanied by a cease and desist
7 order or order for corrective action, or both. The
8 administrative penalty, cease and desist order, and order for
9 corrective action shall become final twenty calendar days after
10 the date of the written notice, unless a contested case hearing
11 is requested pursuant to subsection (c). The violation of the
12 cease and desist order or order for corrective action shall
13 constitute a further violation of this part.
14 (c) Any person aggrieved by the imposition of an
15 administrative penalty, cease and desist order, or order for
16 corrective action may request a contested case hearing pursuant
17 to chapter 91. To request a contested case hearing, the person
18 shall submit a written request to the department of health
19 within twenty calendar days of the date of the written notice.

2 health's final order pursuant to a contested case.
3 (d) Any action taken to recover, collect, or enforce the
4 penalty provided for in this section shall be considered a civil
5 action. For any judicial proceeding to recover or collect an
6 administrative penalty imposed pursuant to subsection (a) or to
7 enforce a cease and desist order or order for corrective action
8 issued pursuant to subsection (b), the department of health may
9 petition any court of appropriate jurisdiction and need only

12 (2) A hearing was held, or the time granted for requesting
13 a hearing has expired without such a request;
