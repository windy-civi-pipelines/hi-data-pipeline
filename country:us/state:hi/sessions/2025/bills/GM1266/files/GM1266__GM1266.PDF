C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO HOUSING.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that it is becoming
2 increasingly difficult to recruit and retain state employees.
3 Having affordable rental opportunities for state employees will
4 reduce the resignation and outmigration of state employees and
5 fill critical labor needs throughout state government.
6 The legislature further finds that with the city and county
7 of Honolulu's construction of an elevated rail transit system,
8 the State has an opportunity to enhance Oahu's urban environment
9 and increase the quality of life for residents by increasing the
10 affordable housing inventory and eliminating the need for
11 personal automobiles, among other public benefits. As the
12 largest landowner of transit-oriented development sites along
13 the transit line in the city and county of Honolulu, as well as
14 being the landowner of other transit-oriented development sites
15 in each of the other counties, the State and its various
16 departments and attached agencies must be proactive in
17 establishing a unified vision and approach toward redevelopment
