SB392 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 392 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to electric bicycles. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds electric bicycles are widely available and becoming a more prevalent means of personal transportation.  However, the growing adoption of electric bicycles on public roads, bike paths, and urban environments has introduced new safety concerns, including risks to riders, pedestrians, and other road users, which necessitate clear and comprehensive safety regulations.  Existing traffic and bicycle laws do not adequately address the unique characteristics and risks associated with electric bicycles. The legislature believes that ensuring the safety of electric bicycle riders and the public requires the implementation of updated regulations governing electric bicycles.  Additionally, public awareness of any new regulations for electric bicycles is necessary for compliance with the regulations. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to update and enhance the State's laws relating to electric bicycles. SECTION 2.  Chapter 291C, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding eight new sections to part XIII to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§291C-A Electric bicycles; insurance, licensing.  No electric bicycle or person operating an electric bicycle shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter relating to financial responsibility, driver's licenses, certificates of title, off-highway vehicles, and license plates. §291C-B  Electric bicycles; labeling.  Manufacturers and distributors of electric bicycles shall apply a label that is permanently affixed, in a prominent location, to each electric bicycle.  The label shall contain the classification number, top assisted speed, and motor wattage of the electric bicycle. §291C-C  Electric bicycle regulations; signage; public information.  (a)  Distributors of electronic bicycles shall place a sign at or near the point of sale with wording substantially similar to the following in all capital letters and printed in not less than fourteen-point font: "THE SALE AND OPERATION OF ELECTRIC BICYCLES ARE SUBJECT TO CHAPTER 291C, HAWAII REVISED STATUTES, INCLUDING SECTION 291C-143.5, HAWAII REVISED STATUTES, WHICH PROHIBITS THE OPERATION OF AN ELECTRIC BICYCLE BY A PERSON UNDER THE AGE OF SIXTEEN." (b)  Distributors of electronic bicycles shall provide to the purchaser of an electronic bicycle a booklet or pamphlet detailing the associated state laws regulating the use of electric bicycles in this part. §291C-D  Electric bicycles; tampering restriction.  No person shall tamper with or modify an electric bicycle so as to change the motor‑powered speed capability or engagement of an electric bicycle or the label indicating the classification number required by section 291C-B. §291C-E  Electric bicycles; Consumer Product Safety Commission compliance.  Electric bicycles shall comply with the equipment and manufacturing requirements for bicycles adopted by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission pursuant to title 16 Code of Federal Regulations part 1512. §291C-F  Electric bicycles; motor disengagement.  An electric bicycle shall operate in a manner so that the electric motor is disengaged or ceases to function when the rider stops pedaling or when the brakes are applied. §291C-G  Infrastructure use by electric bicycles.  (a)  An electric bicycle may be ridden in places where bicycles are allowed, including but not limited to streets, highways, alleys, roadways, sidewalks, or public paths set aside for the exclusive use of bicycles. (b)  Following notice and a public hearing, a county may prohibit the operation of a class 1 electric bicycle, class 2 electric bicycle, or class 3 electric bicycle on places described in subsection (a) if the county finds that such a restriction is needed for safety reasons or compliance with other laws or legal obligations. §291C-H  Class 3 electric bicycles; additional regulations.  (a)  A person under fifteen years of age may ride as a passenger on a class 3 electric bicycle that is designed to accommodate passengers.
