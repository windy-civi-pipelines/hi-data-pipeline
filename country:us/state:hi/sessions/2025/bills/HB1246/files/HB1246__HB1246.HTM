Section 1:
HB1246 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1246 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO CANNABIS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that cannabis, also known as marijuana, is a plant with psychoactive properties derived primarily from its main psychoactive component tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).  Today in the United States, the regulation of the cannabis plant falls into three primary categories:  (1) cannabis for medical use, (2) cannabis for non‑medical adult use, and (3) hemp that contains low levels of THC. Recognizing the diverse beneficial applications of cannabis, particularly in medicinal use and pain management, many states have enacted laws legalizing and regulating medical use cannabis.  In Hawaii, chapter 329D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, establishes the operational guidelines for medical cannabis dispensaries in the State and creates a safe harbor from state criminal prosecution relating to medical use cannabis. In addition to legalizing medical use cannabis, numerous states and jurisdictions, including Hawaii, have opted to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of non-medical use cannabis.  These decisions are motivated by a variety of compelling reasons, including the prioritization of more serious crimes, advancements in criminal justice reform, evolving public opinion, and long-standing social equity concerns within the context of cannabis regulation. Moreover, an increasing number of states have legalized and initiated the regulation and taxation of the cultivation, processing, and sale of non-medical use cannabis to adults aged twenty-one years and older.  Many states have witnessed substantial benefits from the revenue generated through taxes, including use and licensing fees, as well as general excise and sales taxes on the non-medical adult-use cannabis industry. Recognizing these developments in other jurisdictions, pursuant to Act 169, Session Laws of Hawaii 2021, the department of health office of medical cannabis control and regulation convened a task force to explore the development of a dual-system program for cannabis legalization.  This task force issued findings and recommendations for future regulation, covering aspects, such as taxation, social equity, market structure, medical use, and public health and safety. In light of the task force report, the legislature finds that the legalization of cannabis for personal use is a natural, logical, and reasonable outgrowth of the current science of and attitude toward cannabis.  The legislature further finds that cannabis cultivation and sales hold the potential for economic development, increased tax revenues, and reduction in crime.  Consequently, the legislature is prepared to move forward with the legalization of non-medical adult-use cannabis. In addition, with the enactment of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-334), also known as the 2018 Farm Bill, the United States Congress removed hemp (cannabis with no more than 0.3 per cent delta-9-THC by weight) from schedule I of the federal Controlled Substances Act, paving the way for hemp-derived products and the industrial use of hemp.  In response, the legislature enacted Act 263, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023, to reform hemp industry regulations and acknowledge that hemp is a high-value crop with the potential to generate significant and diverse revenues for Hawaii. In alignment with the federal recognition of hemp as a valuable crop with tens of thousands of uses, including for food, fiber, fuel, and remediating soil and capturing carbon, the legislature acknowledges that hemp provides numerous opportunities for diversifying Hawaii's agriculture and rural economic development while furthering Hawaii's food security, energy independence, and sustainability goals.  The vision of many of Hawaii's founding hemp farmers was to integrate hemp and food crops so that the higher margins of high-quality craft hemp products might offset the costs of food production, potentially creating greater financial stability for Hawaii's family farms and supporting greater food security.  Given the significant potential for hemp, the legislature intends to support hemp farming by establishing a grant program to provide technical assistance and offset the impact to the hemp industry by this Act. The legislature further finds that, while hemp holds considerable value for Hawaii's economy and local farmers, certain concerns have surfaced regarding the regulation and enforcement of hemp-derived products that have been processed with the intent to surpass legal THC limits.  These items not only contravene the established medical cannabis framework by surpassing permissible THC levels at dispensaries, but have also been marketed toward minors, causing at least one documented case of illness in children who consumed the hemp-derived products.  Regulating these products is crucial for the State to uphold public health and safety. The issues posed by hemp-derived products, coupled with the growing pains observed in sister states relating to non-medical adult-use cannabis, underscore the necessity to establish uniform regulations for the entire cannabis plant, including hemp.  This approach has emerged as the best practice in the legalization of adult-use cannabis. This legislative effort has six main pillars:  (1) the enactment of the Hawaii Cannabis Law  a legal safe harbor from state criminal prosecution concerning activities relating to cannabis for those who strictly comply with its provisions; (2) the creation of a robust, independent body  the Hawaii cannabis and hemp office  with the power to regulate all aspects of the cannabis plant (whether medical use cannabis, non-medical adult-use cannabis, or hemp) in accordance with the Hawaii Cannabis Law; (3) the continuing role of law enforcement agencies in addressing illegal cannabis operations not acting in accordance with the Hawaii Cannabis Law, which pose threats to public order, public health, and business operators who choose to operate in the legal market; (4) a vibrant, well-funded social equity grant program to be implemented by the Hawaii cannabis and hemp office with the intent to bring greater economic opportunity to disadvantaged regions of the State and help transition formerly illicit operators into the legal market; (5) a delayed effective date of approximately six months for the legalization of non-medical adult-use cannabis and the first legal retail sales to allow the Hawaii cannabis and hemp office, law enforcement, licensees, and the public to prepare; and (6) the implementation of extensive, well-funded public health protections, including a public health and education campaign to inform the public about the new laws, the continuing risks to public health  especially to children  posed by cannabis, and financial assistance for public health services, such as addiction and substance abuse treatment. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Enact the Hawaii Cannabis Law to: (A)  Provide a legal safe harbor from state or county criminal prosecution concerning activities relating to cannabis for those who strictly comply with the provisions of the law; (B)  Establish the Hawaii cannabis and hemp office as an independent body with the power to administratively regulate all aspects of the cannabis plant; (C)  Legalize the sale and possession of cannabis for personal adult use beginning January 1, 2026; (D)  Provide economic opportunities to disproportionately impacted areas; (E)  Encourage those currently engaging in illegal, unlicensed commercial cannabis activities to enter the legal market; (F)  Ensure that state and county law enforcement agencies work closely with the Hawaii cannabis and hemp office and vigorously investigate and prosecute illegal cannabis activities that fall outside any safe harbor protection; and (G)  Mandate that the Hawaii cannabis and hemp office make the protection of public health and safety its highest priorities; (2)  Establish a tax on the retail sale of cannabis and a tax on the sale of medical use cannabis and require every business engaged in the sale of cannabis to obtain a cannabis tax permit; (3)  Add new traffic offenses relating to the consumption or possession of marijuana or marijuana concentrate; (4)  Make conforming amendments relating to the legalization of personal adult use of cannabis under the Hawaii Cannabis Law; (5)  Decriminalize certain drug offenses related to marijuana and marijuana concentrate; (6)  Transfer the personnel and assets of the department of health and assets of the department of agriculture relating to cannabis and hemp to the Hawaii hemp and cannabis office; (7)  Establish various positions within state entities to regulate the personal adult use of cannabis and appropriate funds; and (8)  Make other conforming and housekeeping amendments.

HB1246 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1246 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO CANNABIS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that cannabis, also known as marijuana, is a plant with psychoactive properties derived primarily from its main psychoactive component tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).  Today in the United States, the regulation of the cannabis plant falls into three primary categories:  (1) cannabis for medical use, (2) cannabis for non‑medical adult use, and (3) hemp that contains low levels of THC. Recognizing the diverse beneficial applications of cannabis, particularly in medicinal use and pain management, many states have enacted laws legalizing and regulating medical use cannabis.  In Hawaii, chapter 329D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, establishes the operational guidelines for medical cannabis dispensaries in the State and creates a safe harbor from state criminal prosecution relating to medical use cannabis. In addition to legalizing medical use cannabis, numerous states and jurisdictions, including Hawaii, have opted to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of non-medical use cannabis.  These decisions are motivated by a variety of compelling reasons, including the prioritization of more serious crimes, advancements in criminal justice reform, evolving public opinion, and long-standing social equity concerns within the context of cannabis regulation. Moreover, an increasing number of states have legalized and initiated the regulation and taxation of the cultivation, processing, and sale of non-medical use cannabis to adults aged twenty-one years and older.  Many states have witnessed substantial benefits from the revenue generated through taxes, including use and licensing fees, as well as general excise and sales taxes on the non-medical adult-use cannabis industry. Recognizing these developments in other jurisdictions, pursuant to Act 169, Session Laws of Hawaii 2021, the department of health office of medical cannabis control and regulation convened a task force to explore the development of a dual-system program for cannabis legalization.  This task force issued findings and recommendations for future regulation, covering aspects, such as taxation, social equity, market structure, medical use, and public health and safety. In light of the task force report, the legislature finds that the legalization of cannabis for personal use is a natural, logical, and reasonable outgrowth of the current science of and attitude toward cannabis.  The legislature further finds that cannabis cultivation and sales hold the potential for economic development, increased tax revenues, and reduction in crime.  Consequently, the legislature is prepared to move forward with the legalization of non-medical adult-use cannabis. In addition, with the enactment of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-334), also known as the 2018 Farm Bill, the United States Congress removed hemp (cannabis with no more than 0.3 per cent delta-9-THC by weight) from schedule I of the federal Controlled Substances Act, paving the way for hemp-derived products and the industrial use of hemp.  In response, the legislature enacted Act 263, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023, to reform hemp industry regulations and acknowledge that hemp is a high-value crop with the potential to generate significant and diverse revenues for Hawaii. In alignment with the federal recognition of hemp as a valuable crop with tens of thousands of uses, including for food, fiber, fuel, and remediating soil and capturing carbon, the legislature acknowledges that hemp provides numerous opportunities for diversifying Hawaii's agriculture and rural economic development while furthering Hawaii's food security, energy independence, and sustainability goals.  The vision of many of Hawaii's founding hemp farmers was to integrate hemp and food crops so that the higher margins of high-quality craft hemp products might offset the costs of food production, potentially creating greater financial stability for Hawaii's family farms and supporting greater food security.  Given the significant potential for hemp, the legislature intends to support hemp farming by establishing a grant program to provide technical assistance and offset the impact to the hemp industry by this Act. The legislature further finds that, while hemp holds considerable value for Hawaii's economy and local farmers, certain concerns have surfaced regarding the regulation and enforcement of hemp-derived products that have been processed with the intent to surpass legal THC limits.  These items not only contravene the established medical cannabis framework by surpassing permissible THC levels at dispensaries, but have also been marketed toward minors, causing at least one documented case of illness in children who consumed the hemp-derived products.  Regulating these products is crucial for the State to uphold public health and safety. The issues posed by hemp-derived products, coupled with the growing pains observed in sister states relating to non-medical adult-use cannabis, underscore the necessity to establish uniform regulations for the entire cannabis plant, including hemp.  This approach has emerged as the best practice in the legalization of adult-use cannabis. This legislative effort has six main pillars:  (1) the enactment of the Hawaii Cannabis Law  a legal safe harbor from state criminal prosecution concerning activities relating to cannabis for those who strictly comply with its provisions; (2) the creation of a robust, independent body  the Hawaii cannabis and hemp office  with the power to regulate all aspects of the cannabis plant (whether medical use cannabis, non-medical adult-use cannabis, or hemp) in accordance with the Hawaii Cannabis Law; (3) the continuing role of law enforcement agencies in addressing illegal cannabis operations not acting in accordance with the Hawaii Cannabis Law, which pose threats to public order, public health, and business operators who choose to operate in the legal market; (4) a vibrant, well-funded social equity grant program to be implemented by the Hawaii cannabis and hemp office with the intent to bring greater economic opportunity to disadvantaged regions of the State and help transition formerly illicit operators into the legal market; (5) a delayed effective date of approximately six months for the legalization of non-medical adult-use cannabis and the first legal retail sales to allow the Hawaii cannabis and hemp office, law enforcement, licensees, and the public to prepare; and (6) the implementation of extensive, well-funded public health protections, including a public health and education campaign to inform the public about the new laws, the continuing risks to public health  especially to children  posed by cannabis, and financial assistance for public health services, such as addiction and substance abuse treatment. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Enact the Hawaii Cannabis Law to: (A)  Provide a legal safe harbor from state or county criminal prosecution concerning activities relating to cannabis for those who strictly comply with the provisions of the law; (B)  Establish the Hawaii cannabis and hemp office as an independent body with the power to administratively regulate all aspects of the cannabis plant; (C)  Legalize the sale and possession of cannabis for personal adult use beginning January 1, 2026; (D)  Provide economic opportunities to disproportionately impacted areas; (E)  Encourage those currently engaging in illegal, unlicensed commercial cannabis activities to enter the legal market; (F)  Ensure that state and county law enforcement agencies work closely with the Hawaii cannabis and hemp office and vigorously investigate and prosecute illegal cannabis activities that fall outside any safe harbor protection; and (G)  Mandate that the Hawaii cannabis and hemp office make the protection of public health and safety its highest priorities; (2)  Establish a tax on the retail sale of cannabis and a tax on the sale of medical use cannabis and require every business engaged in the sale of cannabis to obtain a cannabis tax permit; (3)  Add new traffic offenses relating to the consumption or possession of marijuana or marijuana concentrate; (4)  Make conforming amendments relating to the legalization of personal adult use of cannabis under the Hawaii Cannabis Law; (5)  Decriminalize certain drug offenses related to marijuana and marijuana concentrate; (6)  Transfer the personnel and assets of the department of health and assets of the department of agriculture relating to cannabis and hemp to the Hawaii hemp and cannabis office; (7)  Establish various positions within state entities to regulate the personal adult use of cannabis and appropriate funds; and (8)  Make other conforming and housekeeping amendments.
