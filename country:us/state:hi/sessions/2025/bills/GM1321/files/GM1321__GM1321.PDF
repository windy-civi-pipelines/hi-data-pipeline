STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO MENTAL HEALTH.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the State's mental
2 health laws provide the State with a variety of methods to help
3 and support individuals suffering from mental illness or
4 substance abuse. As the number of individuals in need of help
5 increases, so has the need to enhance these laws in a manner
6 that demystifies the complexities of existing procedures,
7 clarifies the circumstances under which action can be taken, and
8 bolsters available tools to best serve these individuals. Legal
9 mechanisms, such as emergency procedures, involuntary
10 hospitalization, assisted community treatment, and authorization
11 for the administration of treatment, enable the State and mental
12 health providers to provide compassionate assistance to
13 individuals suffering from mental illness or substance abuse
14 when they need it the most.
15 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to clarify, update,
16 and revise Hawaii's mental health laws by:

This is to inform you that on June 25, 2025, the following bill was signed into law;

THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO MENTAL HEALTH.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the State's mental
2 health laws provide the State with a variety of methods to help
3 and support individuals suffering from mental illness or
4 substance abuse. As the number of individuals in need of help
5 increases, so has the need to enhance these laws in a manner
6 that demystifies the complexities of existing procedures,
7 clarifies the circumstances under which action can be taken, and
8 bolsters available tools to best serve these individuals. Legal
9 mechanisms, such as emergency procedures, involuntary
10 hospitalization, assisted community treatment, and authorization
11 for the administration of treatment, enable the State and mental
12 health providers to provide compassionate assistance to
13 individuals suffering from mental illness or substance abuse
14 when they need it the most.
15 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to clarify, update,
16 and revise Hawaii's mental health laws by:

6 local law enforcement by persons subject to assisted community
7 treatment orders. The evaluation and report shall also include

7 to self or others and needs to be detained for emergency
8 examination, the law enforcement officer shall contact a mental
9 health emergency worker; provided that the law enforcement

3 is imminently dangerous to self or others, the law enforcement
4 officer shall detain the individual for transportation to a
5 facility for an emergency examination.
6 (b) When a crisis intervention officer has probable cause
7 to believe that an individual is mentally ill or suffering from
8 substance abuse and is imminently dangerous to self or others,
9 the crisis intervention officer shall detain the individual for

11 crisis intervention officer shall contact a mental health
12 emergency worker to determine the type of facility where the
13 individual shall be transported.
14 (c) Any individual detained under this section shall be
15 transported directly to a psychiatric facility or other facility
16 designated by the director, as determined by a mental health
17 emergency worker; provided that if a medical emergency occurs
