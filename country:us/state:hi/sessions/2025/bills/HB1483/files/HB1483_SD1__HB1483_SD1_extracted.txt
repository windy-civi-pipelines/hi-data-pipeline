Section 1:
HB1483 SD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1483 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII S.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO FIREWORKS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the widespread use of illegal fireworks poses an extreme danger and lethal risk to public health and safety, resulting in fires, serious burn injuries, and fatalities to innocent bystanders.  The cost to the community far outweighs any intrinsic benefit, as numerous lives have been lost over the years from the use of illegal fireworks. In addition, the potential for wildfires in this time of climate change is a real and present danger and is a top priority for all levels of government. Tragedies like the New Year's Eve explosion of 2024 have injured or claimed the lives of the elderly, adults, and children, seriously impacting entire neighborhoods in the middle of urban Honolulu and across the State. Fireworks also emit excessive smoke and other toxins into the air, making breathing difficult for thousands of Hawaii residents with respiratory ailments. Noise from loud fireworks traumatizes many residents, particularly war veterans who may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder from being in combat.  Pets and vulnerable species in their natural habitats also must suffer each holiday season when fireworks noise and environmental pollution commences. With the increase in fireworks-related calls, public safety agencies are heavily strained to maintain adequate response levels for other critical emergencies, which adds to the cost of state and county resources that could be used for natural disasters and other emergencies.  They are often overwhelmed and are not able to stop the thousands of illegal fireworks being used, making it a death trap for thousands of innocent lives who are not involved in illegal fireworks use. The legislature further finds that people in the State deserve to live in peace and security without the public safety risk and disruptive impact of illegal fireworks.  There can be no more gray areas when lives are lost while this black market flourishes. The legislature also finds that improved enforcement of the fireworks control laws is necessary, not only to protect property from avoidable fire damage, but also to protect the community from fire- and explosion-related injuries, respiratory distress caused by the air pollution, and recurring trauma to afflicted persons due to loud explosions. The legislature believes a more robust continuum of enforcement mechanisms must be established to promote compliance with the fireworks control laws, including graduated penalties for repeat or felony level offenses, enhanced penalties for offenses that result in injury or death, and a dedicated adjudication system for fireworks infractions, similar to the existing traffic infraction system.  Creating a fireworks infractions system will allow law enforcement agencies and the judiciary to quickly and efficiently process low-level cases, while also allowing them to prioritize higher-level cases as appropriate. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Amend and establish various definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses, including establishing heightened penalties under certain circumstances; (2)  Establish various criminal offenses and penalties related to fireworks or articles pyrotechnic; (3)  Add fireworks infractions to the existing adjudication of infractions process for traffic and emergency period infractions; and (4)  Appropriate funds. SECTION 2.  Chapter 132D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding seven new sections to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§132D-A  General fireworks or articles pyrotechnic prohibitions in the second degree.

"Premises of a licensee or permittee" does not include the licensee's or permittee's private residence or a dwelling that is considered to be the person's [home,] dwelling, including a [single family] single-family house, apartment unit, condominium, townhouse, or cooperative unit." SECTION 18.  Section 291D-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§291D-1  Purpose.  (a)  Act 222, Session Laws of Hawaii 1978, began the process of decriminalizing certain traffic offenses, not of a serious nature, to the status of violations.  In response to a request by the legislature, the judiciary prepared a report in 1987 that recommended, among other things, further decriminalization of traffic offenses, elimination of most traffic arraignments, disposition of uncontested violations by mail, and informal hearings where the violation or the proposed penalty is questioned.  The legislature finds that further decriminalization of certain traffic offenses and streamlining of the handling of those traffic cases will achieve a more expeditious system for the judicial processing of traffic infractions.  The system of processing traffic infractions established by this chapter will: (1)  Eliminate the long and tedious arraignment proceeding for a majority of traffic matters; (2)  Facilitate and encourage the resolution of many traffic infractions through the payment of a monetary assessment; (3)  Speed the disposition of contested cases through a hearing, similar to small claims proceedings, in which the rules of evidence will not apply and the court will consider as evidence the notice of traffic infraction, applicable police reports, or other written statements by the police officer who issued the notice, any other relevant written material, and any evidence or statements by the person contesting the notice of traffic infraction; (4)  Dispense in most cases with the need for witnesses, including law enforcement officers, to be present and for the participation of the prosecuting attorney; (5)  Allow judicial, prosecutorial, and law enforcement resources to be used more efficiently and effectively; and (6)  Save the taxpayers money and reduce their frustration with the judicial system by simplifying the traffic court process. The legislature further finds that this chapter will not require expansion of the current traffic division of the district courts, but will achieve greater efficiency through more effective use of existing resources of the district courts. (b) The legislature finds that the pandemic related to the coronavirus disease 2019 necessitated the imposition of emergency period rules in an attempt to control the spread of the disease in the State.  The thousands of violations of the emergency period rules caused an examination of the ability to impose infractions for lesser offenses as an alternative to using the Penal Code and to allow for more efficient use of the judicial system. The system of processing traffic infractions under this chapter was enacted in 1993 and has provided a useful mechanism for handling offenses deemed as infractions and is well-suited to certain types of violations of emergency period rules that are designated infractions by the governor or mayor under the state's emergency management laws. (c)  The legislature further finds that the illegal use of fireworks poses a serious public health and safety hazard.  Due to the high number of fireworks being set off throughout the State, an expeditious adjudication system for fireworks infractions, such as the system for processing traffic infractions, will allow the judiciary to expediently process violations of the fireworks control law.  This system will allow the judiciary to reserve resources for cases that require more resources." SECTION 19.  Section 291D-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended as follows: 1.  By adding a new definition to be appropriately inserted and to read: ""Fireworks infraction" means any violation of chapter 132D that is not explicitly classified as a felony or misdemeanor, any rule adopted pursuant to chapter 132D, or any county ordinance or rule enacted pursuant to chapter 132D." 2.  By amending the definition of "concurrent trial" to read: ""Concurrent trial" means a trial proceeding held in the district or family court in which the defendant is tried simultaneously in a civil case for any charged traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction and in a criminal case for any related criminal offense, with trials to be held in one court on the same date and at the same time." 3.  By amending the definition of "hearing" to read: ""Hearing" means a proceeding conducted by the district court pursuant to section 291D-8 at which the person to whom a notice of traffic infraction [or], notice of emergency period infraction, or notice of fireworks infraction was issued either admits to the infraction, contests the notice of traffic infraction [or], notice of emergency period infraction, or notice of fireworks infraction, or admits to the traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction but offers an explanation to mitigate the monetary assessment imposed." 4.  By amending the definition of "related criminal offense" to read: ""Related criminal offense" means any criminal violation or crime, committed in the same course of conduct as a traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction, for which the defendant is arrested or charged." SECTION 20.  Section 291D-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsections (a) through (e) to read as follows: "(a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, all traffic infractions [and], emergency period infractions, and fireworks infractions, including infractions committed by minors, shall be adjudicated pursuant to this chapter, except as provided in subsection (b).  This chapter shall be applied uniformly throughout the State and in all counties.  No penal sanction that includes imprisonment shall apply to a violation of a state statute or rule, or county ordinance or rule, that would constitute a traffic infraction [or], an emergency period infraction, or a fireworks infraction under this chapter.  No traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction shall be classified as a criminal offense. (b)  Where a defendant is charged with a traffic infraction [or], an emergency period infraction, or a fireworks infraction and the infraction is committed in the same course of conduct as a criminal offense for which the offender is arrested or charged, the traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction shall be adjudicated pursuant to this chapter; provided that the court may schedule any initial appearance, hearing, or trial on the traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction at the same date, time, and place as the arraignment, hearing, or trial on the related criminal offense. Notwithstanding this subsection and subsection (c), the court shall not schedule any initial appearance, hearing, or trial on the traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction at the same date, time, and place as the arraignment, hearing, or trial on the related criminal offense where the related criminal offense is a felony or is a misdemeanor for which the defendant has demanded a jury trial. (c)  If the defendant requests a trial pursuant to section 291D-13, the trial shall be held in the district court of the circuit in which the traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction was committed. If the court schedules a concurrent trial pursuant to paragraph (1), the concurrent trial shall be held in the appropriate district or family court of the circuit in which the traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction was committed, whichever has jurisdiction over the related criminal offense charged pursuant to the applicable statute or rule of court; provided that: (1)  The district or family court, for the purpose of trial, may schedule a civil trial on the traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction on the same date and at the same time as a criminal trial on the related criminal offense charged.  The court shall enter a civil judgment as to the traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction and a judgment of conviction or acquittal as to the related criminal offense following such concurrent trial; and (2)  If trial on the traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction is held separately from and before trial on any related criminal offense, the following shall be inadmissible in the prosecution or trial of the related criminal offense, except as expressly provided by the Hawaii rules of evidence: (A)  Any written or oral statement made by the defendant in proceedings conducted pursuant to section 291D-7(b); and (B)  Any testimony given by the defendant in the trial on the traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction[.], or fireworks infraction. Such statements or testimony shall not be deemed a waiver of the defendant's privilege against self‑incrimination in connection with any related criminal offense. (d)  In no event shall section 701-109 preclude prosecution for a related criminal offense where a traffic infraction [or], an emergency period infraction, or a fireworks infraction committed in the same course of conduct has been adjudicated pursuant to this chapter. (e)  If the defendant fails to appear at any scheduled court date before the date of trial or concurrent trial and: (1)  The defendant's civil liability for the traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction has not yet been adjudicated pursuant to section 291D-8, the court shall enter a judgment by default in favor of the State for the traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction unless the court determines that good cause or excusable neglect exists for the defendant's failure to appear; or (2)  The defendant's civil liability for the traffic infraction or emergency period infraction has been adjudicated previously pursuant to section 291D-8, the judgment earlier entered in favor of the State shall stand unless the court determines that good cause or excusable neglect exists for the defendant's failure to appear." SECTION 21.  Section 291D-4, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§291D-4 Venue and jurisdiction. (a)  All violations of state law, ordinances, or rules designated as traffic infractions [or], emergency period infractions, or fireworks infractions in this chapter shall be adjudicated in the district and circuit where the alleged infraction occurred, except as otherwise provided by law. (b)  Except as otherwise provided by law, jurisdiction is in the district court of the circuit where the alleged traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction occurred.  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, district court judges shall adjudicate traffic infractions [and], emergency period infractions[.], and fireworks infractions." SECTION 22.  Section 291D-5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsections (a) through (d) to read as follows: "(a)  The notice of traffic infraction for moving violations, [and] the notice of emergency period infraction, and the notice of fireworks infraction shall include the summons for the purposes of this chapter.  Whenever a notice of traffic infraction [or], notice of emergency period infraction, or notice of fireworks infraction is issued, the person's signature, driver's license number or state identification number, electronic mail address, and current address shall be noted on the notice.

Raw Text:
HB1483 SD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1483 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII S.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO FIREWORKS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the widespread use of illegal fireworks poses an extreme danger and lethal risk to public health and safety, resulting in fires, serious burn injuries, and fatalities to innocent bystanders.  The cost to the community far outweighs any intrinsic benefit, as numerous lives have been lost over the years from the use of illegal fireworks. In addition, the potential for wildfires in this time of climate change is a real and present danger and is a top priority for all levels of government. Tragedies like the New Year's Eve explosion of 2024 have injured or claimed the lives of the elderly, adults, and children, seriously impacting entire neighborhoods in the middle of urban Honolulu and across the State. Fireworks also emit excessive smoke and other toxins into the air, making breathing difficult for thousands of Hawaii residents with respiratory ailments. Noise from loud fireworks traumatizes many residents, particularly war veterans who may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder from being in combat.  Pets and vulnerable species in their natural habitats also must suffer each holiday season when fireworks noise and environmental pollution commences. With the increase in fireworks-related calls, public safety agencies are heavily strained to maintain adequate response levels for other critical emergencies, which adds to the cost of state and county resources that could be used for natural disasters and other emergencies.  They are often overwhelmed and are not able to stop the thousands of illegal fireworks being used, making it a death trap for thousands of innocent lives who are not involved in illegal fireworks use. The legislature further finds that people in the State deserve to live in peace and security without the public safety risk and disruptive impact of illegal fireworks.  There can be no more gray areas when lives are lost while this black market flourishes. The legislature also finds that improved enforcement of the fireworks control laws is necessary, not only to protect property from avoidable fire damage, but also to protect the community from fire- and explosion-related injuries, respiratory distress caused by the air pollution, and recurring trauma to afflicted persons due to loud explosions. The legislature believes a more robust continuum of enforcement mechanisms must be established to promote compliance with the fireworks control laws, including graduated penalties for repeat or felony level offenses, enhanced penalties for offenses that result in injury or death, and a dedicated adjudication system for fireworks infractions, similar to the existing traffic infraction system.  Creating a fireworks infractions system will allow law enforcement agencies and the judiciary to quickly and efficiently process low-level cases, while also allowing them to prioritize higher-level cases as appropriate. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Amend and establish various definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses, including establishing heightened penalties under certain circumstances; (2)  Establish various criminal offenses and penalties related to fireworks or articles pyrotechnic; (3)  Add fireworks infractions to the existing adjudication of infractions process for traffic and emergency period infractions; and (4)  Appropriate funds. SECTION 2.  Chapter 132D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding seven new sections to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§132D-A  General fireworks or articles pyrotechnic prohibitions in the second degree.

(c) Any licensee or permittee who refuses the [law enforcement or fire officer] inspector entry or access to the premises, books, or records shall be in violation of the conditions of the license or permit.  After a hearing, the issuing department shall suspend or revoke the license or permit for refusing entry or access or for violations of any other requirement or condition of the license or permit or any provision of this chapter or rule adopted pursuant to this chapter.  The issuing department shall provide the licensee or permittee with a written notice and order describing the basis for the suspension or revocation.  Any person aggrieved by the suspension or revocation determination may request a contested case hearing pursuant to chapter 91.  To request a contested case hearing, the person shall submit a written request to the issuing department within thirty calendar days of the date of the notice and order of the suspension or revocation.  Appeal to the circuit court under section 91-14, or any other applicable statute, shall only be taken from the issuing department's final order pursuant to a contested case. (d) Any licensee, permittee, employee of a licensee or permittee, or other person who: (1)  Threatens with the use of violence, force, or physical interference or obstacle, or hinders, obstructs, or prevents any [law enforcement or fire officer,] inspector, or any person assisting [a law enforcement or fire officer,] an inspector, from entering into the premises of the licensee or permittee; or (2)  Opposes, obstructs, or molests [a law enforcement or fire officer] an inspector in the [officer's] inspector's enforcement of this chapter, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of no more than $2,000 or imprisonment for no more than one year, or both. (e) If any [law enforcement or fire officer,] inspector having demanded admittance onto the premises of a licensee or permittee and declared the [officer's] inspector's name and office, is not admitted by the licensee, permittee, or person in charge of the premises, the [officer] inspector may use force to enter the premises. (f) For purposes of this section[, "premises]: "Inspector" means any county fire department officer, including firefighters. "Premises of a licensee or permittee" does not include the licensee's or permittee's private residence or a dwelling that is considered to be the person's [home,] dwelling, including a [single family] single-family house, apartment unit, condominium, townhouse, or cooperative unit." SECTION 18.  Section 291D-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§291D-1  Purpose.  (a)  Act 222, Session Laws of Hawaii 1978, began the process of decriminalizing certain traffic offenses, not of a serious nature, to the status of violations.  In response to a request by the legislature, the judiciary prepared a report in 1987 that recommended, among other things, further decriminalization of traffic offenses, elimination of most traffic arraignments, disposition of uncontested violations by mail, and informal hearings where the violation or the proposed penalty is questioned.  The legislature finds that further decriminalization of certain traffic offenses and streamlining of the handling of those traffic cases will achieve a more expeditious system for the judicial processing of traffic infractions.  The system of processing traffic infractions established by this chapter will: (1)  Eliminate the long and tedious arraignment proceeding for a majority of traffic matters; (2)  Facilitate and encourage the resolution of many traffic infractions through the payment of a monetary assessment; (3)  Speed the disposition of contested cases through a hearing, similar to small claims proceedings, in which the rules of evidence will not apply and the court will consider as evidence the notice of traffic infraction, applicable police reports, or other written statements by the police officer who issued the notice, any other relevant written material, and any evidence or statements by the person contesting the notice of traffic infraction; (4)  Dispense in most cases with the need for witnesses, including law enforcement officers, to be present and for the participation of the prosecuting attorney; (5)  Allow judicial, prosecutorial, and law enforcement resources to be used more efficiently and effectively; and (6)  Save the taxpayers money and reduce their frustration with the judicial system by simplifying the traffic court process. The legislature further finds that this chapter will not require expansion of the current traffic division of the district courts, but will achieve greater efficiency through more effective use of existing resources of the district courts. (b) The legislature finds that the pandemic related to the coronavirus disease 2019 necessitated the imposition of emergency period rules in an attempt to control the spread of the disease in the State.  The thousands of violations of the emergency period rules caused an examination of the ability to impose infractions for lesser offenses as an alternative to using the Penal Code and to allow for more efficient use of the judicial system. The system of processing traffic infractions under this chapter was enacted in 1993 and has provided a useful mechanism for handling offenses deemed as infractions and is well-suited to certain types of violations of emergency period rules that are designated infractions by the governor or mayor under the state's emergency management laws. (c)  The legislature further finds that the illegal use of fireworks poses a serious public health and safety hazard.  Due to the high number of fireworks being set off throughout the State, an expeditious adjudication system for fireworks infractions, such as the system for processing traffic infractions, will allow the judiciary to expediently process violations of the fireworks control law.  This system will allow the judiciary to reserve resources for cases that require more resources." SECTION 19.  Section 291D-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended as follows: 1.  By adding a new definition to be appropriately inserted and to read: ""Fireworks infraction" means any violation of chapter 132D that is not explicitly classified as a felony or misdemeanor, any rule adopted pursuant to chapter 132D, or any county ordinance or rule enacted pursuant to chapter 132D." 2.  By amending the definition of "concurrent trial" to read: ""Concurrent trial" means a trial proceeding held in the district or family court in which the defendant is tried simultaneously in a civil case for any charged traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction and in a criminal case for any related criminal offense, with trials to be held in one court on the same date and at the same time." 3.  By amending the definition of "hearing" to read: ""Hearing" means a proceeding conducted by the district court pursuant to section 291D-8 at which the person to whom a notice of traffic infraction [or], notice of emergency period infraction, or notice of fireworks infraction was issued either admits to the infraction, contests the notice of traffic infraction [or], notice of emergency period infraction, or notice of fireworks infraction, or admits to the traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction but offers an explanation to mitigate the monetary assessment imposed." 4.  By amending the definition of "related criminal offense" to read: ""Related criminal offense" means any criminal violation or crime, committed in the same course of conduct as a traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction, for which the defendant is arrested or charged." SECTION 20.  Section 291D-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsections (a) through (e) to read as follows: "(a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, all traffic infractions [and], emergency period infractions, and fireworks infractions, including infractions committed by minors, shall be adjudicated pursuant to this chapter, except as provided in subsection (b).  This chapter shall be applied uniformly throughout the State and in all counties.  No penal sanction that includes imprisonment shall apply to a violation of a state statute or rule, or county ordinance or rule, that would constitute a traffic infraction [or], an emergency period infraction, or a fireworks infraction under this chapter.  No traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction shall be classified as a criminal offense. (b)  Where a defendant is charged with a traffic infraction [or], an emergency period infraction, or a fireworks infraction and the infraction is committed in the same course of conduct as a criminal offense for which the offender is arrested or charged, the traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction shall be adjudicated pursuant to this chapter; provided that the court may schedule any initial appearance, hearing, or trial on the traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction at the same date, time, and place as the arraignment, hearing, or trial on the related criminal offense. Notwithstanding this subsection and subsection (c), the court shall not schedule any initial appearance, hearing, or trial on the traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction at the same date, time, and place as the arraignment, hearing, or trial on the related criminal offense where the related criminal offense is a felony or is a misdemeanor for which the defendant has demanded a jury trial. (c)  If the defendant requests a trial pursuant to section 291D-13, the trial shall be held in the district court of the circuit in which the traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction was committed. If the court schedules a concurrent trial pursuant to paragraph (1), the concurrent trial shall be held in the appropriate district or family court of the circuit in which the traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction was committed, whichever has jurisdiction over the related criminal offense charged pursuant to the applicable statute or rule of court; provided that: (1)  The district or family court, for the purpose of trial, may schedule a civil trial on the traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction on the same date and at the same time as a criminal trial on the related criminal offense charged.  The court shall enter a civil judgment as to the traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction and a judgment of conviction or acquittal as to the related criminal offense following such concurrent trial; and (2)  If trial on the traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction is held separately from and before trial on any related criminal offense, the following shall be inadmissible in the prosecution or trial of the related criminal offense, except as expressly provided by the Hawaii rules of evidence: (A)  Any written or oral statement made by the defendant in proceedings conducted pursuant to section 291D-7(b); and (B)  Any testimony given by the defendant in the trial on the traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction[.], or fireworks infraction. Such statements or testimony shall not be deemed a waiver of the defendant's privilege against self‑incrimination in connection with any related criminal offense. (d)  In no event shall section 701-109 preclude prosecution for a related criminal offense where a traffic infraction [or], an emergency period infraction, or a fireworks infraction committed in the same course of conduct has been adjudicated pursuant to this chapter. (e)  If the defendant fails to appear at any scheduled court date before the date of trial or concurrent trial and: (1)  The defendant's civil liability for the traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction has not yet been adjudicated pursuant to section 291D-8, the court shall enter a judgment by default in favor of the State for the traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction unless the court determines that good cause or excusable neglect exists for the defendant's failure to appear; or (2)  The defendant's civil liability for the traffic infraction or emergency period infraction has been adjudicated previously pursuant to section 291D-8, the judgment earlier entered in favor of the State shall stand unless the court determines that good cause or excusable neglect exists for the defendant's failure to appear." SECTION 21.  Section 291D-4, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§291D-4 Venue and jurisdiction. (a)  All violations of state law, ordinances, or rules designated as traffic infractions [or], emergency period infractions, or fireworks infractions in this chapter shall be adjudicated in the district and circuit where the alleged infraction occurred, except as otherwise provided by law. (b)  Except as otherwise provided by law, jurisdiction is in the district court of the circuit where the alleged traffic infraction [or], emergency period infraction, or fireworks infraction occurred.  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, district court judges shall adjudicate traffic infractions [and], emergency period infractions[.], and fireworks infractions." SECTION 22.  Section 291D-5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsections (a) through (d) to read as follows: "(a)  The notice of traffic infraction for moving violations, [and] the notice of emergency period infraction, and the notice of fireworks infraction shall include the summons for the purposes of this chapter.  Whenever a notice of traffic infraction [or], notice of emergency period infraction, or notice of fireworks infraction is issued, the person's signature, driver's license number or state identification number, electronic mail address, and current address shall be noted on the notice.
