<div class=WordSection2>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the
widespread use of illegal fireworks poses an extreme danger and lethal risk to
public health and safety, resulting in fires, serious burn injuries, and
fatalities to innocent bystanders.  The cost to the community far outweighs any
intrinsic benefit, as numerous lives have been lost over the years from the use
of illegal fireworks.  In addition, the potential for wildfires in this time of
climate change is a real and present danger and is a top priority for all
levels of government.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Tragedies like the New Year's Eve explosion of
2024 have injured or claimed the lives of the elderly, adults, and children,
seriously impacting entire neighborhoods in the middle of urban Honolulu and
across the State.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Fireworks also emit excessive smoke and other
toxins into the air, making breathing difficult for thousands of Hawaii
residents with respiratory ailments.  Noise from loud fireworks traumatizes
many residents, particularly war veterans who may suffer from post-traumatic
stress disorder from being in combat.  Pets and vulnerable species in their
natural habitats also must suffer each holiday season when fireworks noise and
environmental pollution commences.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     With the increase in fireworks-related calls,
public safety agencies are heavily strained to maintain adequate response
levels for other critical emergencies, which adds to the cost of state and
county resources that could be used for natural disasters and other
emergencies.  They are often overwhelmed and are not able to stop the thousands
of illegal fireworks being used, making it a death trap for thousands of
innocent lives who are not involved in illegal fireworks use.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature further finds that people in
the State deserve to live in peace and security without the public safety risk
and disruptive impact of illegal fireworks.  There can be no more gray areas
when lives are lost while this black market flourishes.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature also finds that improved
enforcement of the fireworks control laws is necessary, not only to protect
property from avoidable fire damage, but also to protect the community from
fire- and explosion-related injuries, respiratory distress caused by the air
pollution, and recurring trauma to afflicted persons due to loud explosions.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature believes that a more robust
continuum of enforcement mechanisms must be established to promote compliance
with the fireworks control laws.  This includes implementing graduated
penalties for repeat or felony-level offenses, imposing enhanced penalties for
offenses that result in injury or death, and adjudicating fireworks infractions
under the same system used for traffic and emergency period infractions.  The
fireworks infractions system will allow law enforcement agencies and the
judiciary to quickly and efficiently process low-level cases, while also
allowing them to prioritize higher-level cases as appropriate.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Establish various criminal offenses and penalties
related to fireworks or articles pyrotechnic;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Amend and establish various definitions and
penalties for fireworks offenses, including establishing heightened penalties
under certain circumstances; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Incorporate fireworks infractions into the
existing adjudication process for traffic and emergency period infractions.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     SECTION 2.  Chapter 132D, Hawaii Revised
Statutes, is amended by adding seven new sections to be appropriately
designated and to read as follows:</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;<b><u>§132D-A</u>  <u>General fireworks
or articles pyrotechnic prohibitions in the second degree.</u></b>  <u>(a)  A person
commits the offense of general fireworks or articles pyrotechnic prohibitions
in the second degree if, without a permit issued pursuant to sections 132D-10
and 132D-16, the person intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly:</u></p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     <u>(1)</u>  <u>S<a name="_Hlk187746828">ets off,
ignites, discharges, or otherwise causes to explode</a> any aerial devices,
articles pyrotechnic, or display fireworks:</u></p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          <u>(A)</u>  <u>Within one thousand feet of any
operating hospital, licensed convalescent home, licensed home for the elderly,
zoo, licensed animal shelter, or licensed animal hospital;</u></p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          <u>(B)</u>  <u>In any school building, or on
any school grounds or yards without first obtaining authorization from
appropriate school officials;</u></p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          <u>(C)</u>  <u>On any highway, alley, street,
sidewalk, other public way, or public beach;</u></p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          <u>(D)</u>  <u>In any park or officially
designated forest or wildlife preserve;</u></p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          <u>(E)</u>  <u>Within fifty feet of a
canefield;</u></p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          <u>(F)</u>  <u>Within one thousand feet of any
building used for public worship during the periods when services are held; or</u></p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          <u>(G)</u>  <u>Within five hundred feet of any
dwelling; or</u></p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     <u>(2)</u>  <u>Throws, catapults, or otherwise
manually propels ignited aerial devices, articles pyrotechnic, consumer
fireworks, or display fireworks.</u></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <u>(b)  The state of mind requirement for the
offense under subsection (a)(1)(A), (E), (F), and (G) shall not be applicable
to whether the person was aware that the person was within the designated
distance from an operating hospital, licensed convalescent home, licensed home
for the elderly, zoo, licensed animal shelter, or licensed animal hospital;
canefield; building used for public worship; or dwelling.  A person shall be
strictly liable with respect to the attendant circumstance that the person was
within the designated distance from a prohibited place at the time of incident.</u></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <u>(c)  Except as otherwise provided in subsections
(d), (e), and (f), the offense of general fireworks or articles pyrotechnic
prohibitions in the second degree shall be a misdemeanor.</u></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <u>(d)  The offense of general fireworks or
articles pyrotechnic prohibitions in the second degree shall be a class C

<p class=Amend>     SECTION 18.  Section 291D-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;<b>§291D-1  Purpose</b><b>.</b>  (a)  Act
222, Session Laws of Hawaii 1978, began the process of decriminalizing certain
traffic offenses, not of a serious nature, to the status of violations.  In
response to a request by the legislature, the judiciary prepared a report in
1987 that recommended, among other things, further decriminalization of traffic
offenses, elimination of most traffic arraignments, disposition of uncontested
violations by mail, and informal hearings where the violation or the proposed
penalty is questioned.  The legislature finds that further decriminalization of
certain traffic offenses and streamlining of the handling of those traffic
cases will achieve a more expeditious system for the judicial processing of
traffic infractions.  The system of processing traffic infractions established
by this chapter will:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Eliminate the long and tedious arraignment
proceeding for a majority of traffic matters;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Facilitate and encourage the resolution of many
traffic infractions through the payment of a monetary assessment;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Speed the disposition of contested cases through
a hearing, similar to small claims proceedings, in which the rules of evidence
will not apply and the court will consider as evidence the notice of traffic
infraction, applicable police reports, or other written statements by the
police officer who issued the notice, any other relevant written material, and
any evidence or statements by the person contesting the notice of traffic
infraction;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Dispense in most cases with the need for
witnesses, including law enforcement officers, to be present and for the
participation of the prosecuting attorney;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Allow judicial, prosecutorial, and law
enforcement resources to be used more efficiently and effectively; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  Save the taxpayers money and reduce their
frustration with the judicial system by simplifying the traffic court process.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>The legislature further finds that this chapter will
not require expansion of the current traffic division of the district courts,
but will achieve greater efficiency through more effective use of existing
resources of the district courts.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The legislature finds that the pandemic
related to the coronavirus disease 2019 necessitated the imposition of
emergency period rules in an attempt to control the spread of the disease in
the State.  The thousands of violations of the emergency period rules caused an
examination of the ability to impose infractions for lesser offenses as an
alternative to using the Penal Code and to allow for more efficient use of the
judicial system.  The system of processing traffic infractions under this
chapter was enacted in 1993 and has provided a useful mechanism for handling
offenses deemed as infractions and is well-suited to certain types of
violations of emergency period rules that are designated infractions by the
governor or mayor under the state's emergency management laws.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <u>(c)  The legislature further finds that the
illegal use of fireworks poses a serious public health and safety hazard.  Due
to the high number of fireworks being set off throughout the State, an
expeditious adjudication system for fireworks infractions, such as the system
for processing traffic infractions, will allow the judiciary to expediently
process violations of the fireworks control law.  This system will allow the
judiciary to reserve resources for cases that require more resources.</u>&quot;</p>

<p class=Misc>     SECTION 19.  Section 291D-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
amended as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>     1.  By adding a new definition
to be appropriately inserted and to read:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>     &quot;<u>&quot;Fireworks
infraction&quot; means any violation of chapter 132D that is not explicitly
classified as a felony or misdemeanor, any rule adopted pursuant to chapter

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>     2.  By amending the definition

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>     &quot;&quot;Concurrent
trial&quot; means a trial proceeding held in the district or family court in
which the defendant is tried simultaneously in a civil case for any charged
traffic infraction [<s>or</s>]<u>,</u> emergency period infraction<u>, or

offense, with trials to be held in one court on the same date and at the same
time.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>     3.  By amending the definition

infraction [<s>or</s>]<u>,</u> notice of emergency period infraction, <u>or
notice of fireworks infraction,</u> or admits to the traffic<u> </u>infraction [<s>or</s>]<u>,</u>
emergency period infraction<u>, or fireworks infraction</u> but offers an
explanation to mitigate the monetary assessment imposed.&quot;</p>

<p class=Amend>     4.  By amending the definition of &quot;related criminal

<p class=Amend>     &quot;&quot;Related criminal offense&quot; means any

shall apply to a violation of a state statute or rule, or county ordinance or

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  If the defendant requests a trial pursuant

shall be held in the appropriate district or family court of the circuit in
which the traffic infraction [<s>or</s>]<u>,</u> emergency period infraction<u>,

related criminal offense charged pursuant to the applicable statute or rule of
court; provided that:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The district or family court, for the purpose of
trial, may schedule a civil trial on the traffic infraction [<s>or</s>]<u>,</u>

the person and posting of an appearance bond equal to the amount of the total
amount specified in the default judgment and any other assessment imposed
pursuant to section 291D-9.  The application shall show good cause or excusable
neglect for the person's failure to take action necessary to prevent entry of
judgment by default.  Thereafter, the court shall determine whether good cause
or excusable neglect exists for the person's failure to take action necessary
to prevent entry of judgment by default.  If so, the application to set aside
default judgment shall be granted, the default judgment shall be set aside, and
the notice of traffic infraction [<s>or</s>]<u>,</u> notice of emergency period
infraction<u>, or notice of fireworks infraction</u> shall be disposed of
pursuant to this chapter.  If not, the application to set aside default
judgment shall be denied, the appearance bond shall be forfeited and applied to
satisfy amounts due under the default judgment, and the notice of traffic
infraction [<s>or</s>]<u>,</u> notice of emergency period infraction<u>, or
notice of fireworks infraction</u> shall be finally disposed.  In either case,
the court shall determine the existence of good cause or excusable neglect and
notify the person of its decision on the application in writing.&quot;</p>
