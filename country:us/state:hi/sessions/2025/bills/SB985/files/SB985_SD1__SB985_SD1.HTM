Section 1:
SB985 SD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 985 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO CONSUMER PROTECTION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic devastated the economy, workforce, businesses, and the people.  In the aftermath, gift card scams have increased significantly, particularly through gift card draining, in which nefarious individuals steal gift cards from store displays, then copy card and personal identification numbers from the cards, and return the cards to shelves.  After honest consumers purchase those gift cards and load them with value, the scammers then use the stolen information to drain the cards of that value.  The legislature believes that it is necessary to shield consumers from these practices. The legislature also believes that the State's current gift certificate law, which also covers gift cards, needs to be updated. While the law contains several positive elements, including a prohibition on periodic gift certificate service fees, the law can also be enhanced to increase transparency and protections for consumers. Accordingly, the purpose this Act is to: (1)  Establish a new gift card fraud law, under the scope of the unfair and deceptive practices law, which requires merchants and third-party gift card resellers to take certain steps to prevent gift card scams; (2)  Require the conspicuous provision of information regarding terms and conditions of gift certificates, regardless of whether the cards are sold in person, electronically, or telephonically; and (3)  Extend from two years to four years the minimum redemption period for paper gift certificates. SECTION 2.  Chapter 481B, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part .  GIFT CARD FRAUD §481BA  Definitions.  For the purposes of this part: "Closed-loop gift card" means a card, code, or device that is: (1)  Issued to a consumer on a prepaid basis primarily for personal, family, or household purposes in a specified amount, regardless of whether that amount may be increased or reloaded in exchange for payment; and (2)  Redeemable on presentation by a consumer at a single merchant or a group of affiliated merchants.
