No. 85, H.D. 2, S.D. 1 (2016), Hawaii faces a recidivism rate of over fifty percent; and WHEREAS, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has implemented work furlough programs across the State with the intention of enhancing the systemic reorientation process for inmates who pose minimal risk to local communities but not necessarily for the risk to recidivate; and WHEREAS, the inmate work furlough programs provide eligible inmates with an opportunity to actively job seek, establish financial stability, develop social connections, and find appropriate housing prior to release from incarceration; and WHEREAS, it is critical for highway maintenance, whether pothole management or vegetation control, to have a robust workforce in order to sustain safer roadways; and WHEREAS, providing the Department of Transportation with additional workforce through the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's inmate workforce furlough programs is a reliable avenue to improve the State's roadways and highways while providing inmates access to beneficial work that would assist their reentry into society upon release from incarceration; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, that the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is requested to collaborate with the Department of Transportation to use inmate work furlough programs for state roadway and highway maintenance; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to Director of Corrections and Rehabilitation and Director of Transportation.
