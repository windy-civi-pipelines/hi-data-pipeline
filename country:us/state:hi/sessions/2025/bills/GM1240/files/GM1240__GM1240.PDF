THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
C,D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO TRANSPORTATION SERVICES.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the availability of
2 school bus services is essential to student attendance. School
3 bus services are particularly crucial for families who live in
4 rural and remote areas, as well as students who come from
5 socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. Currently, there
6 is a nationwide shortage of school bus drivers. This shortage
7 is impacting the State, forcing the suspension or partial
8 suspension of school bus services to central Oahu and east
9 Hawaii island. In the 2024-2025 school year, a total of one
10 hundred thirty-eight routes were temporarily suspended,
11 affecting nearly three thousand seven hundred twenty students
12 who signed up for bus transportation.
13 The legislature further finds that, to address the shortage
14 of school bus drivers in Hawaii, the governor issued an
15 emergency proclamation in August 2024 to allow the department of
16 transportation to grant exemptions for the use of vehicles other
17 than school buses to transport students. Specifically, this and
2025-3441 HB862 CDl HMSO

C.D. 1
1 subsequent related emergency proclamations allow for the
2 transport of students using vehicles other than school vehicles
3 by drivers possessing a commercial driver's license with an
4 endorsement authorizing the driving of vehicles carrying
5 passengers. The legislature believes that making this exemption
6 permanent may help alleviate the lack of school bus drivers.
7 The purpose of this Act is to ensure that certain
8 provisions of the governor's August 2024 emergency proclamation
9 on school bus services is placed into statute by authorizing the
10 use of motorcoaches, small buses, and vans for school bus
11 services; provided certain conditions are met.
12 SECTION 2. Section 286-102, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
13 amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows:
14 " (b) A person operating the following category or
15 combination of categories of motor vehicles shall be examined as
16 provided in section 286-108 and duly licensed by the examiner of
17 drivers:
18 (1) Mopeds;
19 (2) Motorcycles, except for autocycles as described in

12 van and shall comply with the standards of the department of
13 transportation as provided by rules adopted pursuant to section
14 286-181."
15 SECTION 3. Section 286-181, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
16 amended as follows:
17 1. By amending subsections (b) through (e) to read:
