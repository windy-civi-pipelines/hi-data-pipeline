HB726 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 726 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to a statewide data and artificial intelligence governance and decision intelligence center. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that to break down data silos, improve data quality, improve interoperability, increase citizen satisfaction, and drive government performance, there is a need for statewide data solutions through data sharing, data and artificial intelligence governance, evidence-based decision making, and responsible use of data and artificial intelligence.  Current data is stored in siloed systems, causing challenges when multiple agencies are often involved in a citizen's life events, especially during emergency response situations.  The Maui wildfire and its impact on residents and others identified a need for timely and consistent data sharing among state agencies, and external service providers proved critical in providing essential needs, including housing and medical and educational support. The purpose of this Act is to establish and appropriate funds for a statewide data and artificial intelligence governance and decision intelligence center to break down data silos, improve data quality, improve transparency, use data and artificial intelligence responsibly, enable timely and accurate evidence-based decision-making, and ensure quality and timeliness of open data to promote transparency. SECTION 2.  Chapter 27, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part VII to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§27-     Data and artificial intelligence governance and decision intelligence center; established.  (a) There is established within the office of enterprise technology services a data and artificial intelligence governance and decision intelligence center, which shall be under the authority of the chief data officer. (b) The data and artificial intelligence governance and decision intelligence center shall be responsible for: (1)  Facilitating the creation of a statewide memorandum of understanding for data sharing; (2)  Enabling secured and efficient data sharing across state agencies through implementing statewide data sharing tools and platforms to improve interoperability; (3)  Implementing data and artificial intelligence policies and statewide data and artificial intelligence governance tools to allow agencies to protect data through proper access control for secured use of data and artificial intelligence; (4)  Collaborating with agencies and utilizing master data management technology to create a statewide master citizen record to enable seamless citizen service and improve citizen experience; (5)  Creating and managing a statewide integrated data and artificial intelligence platform to facilitate data sharing to enable analytics and decision recommendations; (6)  Establishing a team to support agency implementation of data policies, data management, and data analytics to support agencies and decision makers in evidence-based decision making; and (7)  Collaborating with county and other governmental agencies and private sector service providers to obtain and integrate necessary data for sharing to better service citizens. (c)  For the purposes of this section: "Data and artificial intelligence governance" means creating and implementing policies, standards, and tools to ensure availability, quality, security, privacy protection, and usability of data and artificial intelligence. "Decision intelligence" means the use of machine learning-enabled and artificial intelligence-enabled data analytics and predictive models with visualized insights to provide decision recommendations, support operations, and track the impact of decisions. "Integrated data and artificial intelligence platform" means a comprehensive data management solution package, including machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities, that enables agencies to gather, manage, analyze, visualize, and share data, as well as conduct analytics, predictions, and decision intelligence functions, to gain insights in order to support decisions, policy making, and operations. "Open data" means data that can be shared with the public for use and republication without restriction." SECTION 3.  Section 27-44, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows: "(a)  There is established within the office of enterprise technology services a full-time chief data officer to develop, implement, and manage statewide data policies, procedures, and standards pursuant to section 27-44.3 [and to], facilitate data sharing across state agencies[.], and oversee the data and artificial intelligence governance and decision intelligence center pursuant to section 27-   .  The chief data officer shall use the state information assets and analytics to research and recommend processes and tools to improve inter-departmental and intra-departmental decision making and reporting.  The chief data officer shall be appointed by and report directly to the chief information officer.  Each executive branch department, including the department of education and University of Hawaii, shall use reasonable efforts to make appropriate and existing data sets maintained by the department electronically available to the public through the State's open data portal at data.hawaii.gov or successor website designated by the chief data officer; provided that: (1)  Nothing in this chapter shall require departments to create new electronic data sets or to make data sets available upon demand; (2)  Data licensed to the State by another person or entity shall not be made public under this chapter unless the person or entity licensing the data agrees to the public disclosure; and (3)  Proprietary and other information protected from disclosure by law or contract shall not be disclosed. This disclosure shall be consistent with the policies, procedures, and standards developed by the chief data officer and consistent with applicable law, including chapter 92F and other state and federal laws related to security and privacy, and no personally identifiable information shall be posted online unless the identified individual has consented to the posting or the posting is necessary to fulfill the lawful purposes or duties of the department."
