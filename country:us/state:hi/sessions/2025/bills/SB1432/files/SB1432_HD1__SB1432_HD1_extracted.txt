SB1432 HD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1432 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO CHANGES TO RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CONCERNING PATIENTS, THE COUNTY OF KALAWAO, AND THE KALAUPAPA SETTLEMENT. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the population of former Hansen's disease patients residing at Kalaupapa in the county of Kalawao is aging.  There are currently seven individuals on the Kalaupapa registry who receive services from the State.  Four of them are full-time residents at Kalaupapa.  All these patients are age eighty-three years or older. The legislature finds that the county of Kalawao consists of that portion of the island of Molokai commonly known as the Kalaupapa Settlement and that the county of Kalawao is under the jurisdiction and control of the department of health and governed by the laws and rules relating to the department and the care and treatment of persons affected with Hansen's disease.  After the passing of the last full- or part-time patient resident at Kalaupapa, the department of health will no longer provide patient care there but intends to complete environmental remediation work. The legislature further finds that there are many other stakeholders that care about the future of the Kalaupapa Settlement and the preservation of the historical, cultural, and environmental significance of the county of Kalawao. This Act reflects preliminary sentiments expressed by some Maui county residents that the county of Kalawao be reunited with the county of Maui.  A transparent process and opportunity for more extensive public input regarding the transfer of jurisdiction and control of Kalawao county is required. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Prepare for changes to responsibilities of the department of health upon the passing of the last patient resident of the Kalaupapa Settlement; (2)  Commemorate and preserve the historical, cultural, and environmental significance of the peninsula and its residents in Hawaii's history with the establishment of the Kalaupapa state historical area; and (3)  Provide to the public the opportunity for input on the future of the county of Kalawao; and (4)  Require any future planning for the permanent transfer of the powers and duties of the department and any other state agency over Kalaupapa Settlement to other governmental or qualified non-governmental entities, to include a community organization in the county of Kalawao that is designated in P.L. 111-11, title VII, section 7108, and a topside community organization selected in consultation with the Molokai community. PART II SECTION 2.  Chapter 6E, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part II to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§6E-     Kalaupapa state historical area.  (a)  There shall be a Kalaupapa state historical area that shall consist of that portion of the island of Molokai known as Kalaupapa, Kalawao, and Waikolu, and commonly known or designated as the Kalaupapa Settlement. (b)  The Kalaupapa state historical area is established to preserve the Kalaupapa Settlement, educate the public, commemorate the lives of residents with Hansen's disease and the lives of the people who served them, and recognize the county of Kalawao and its role in the history of Hawaii." SECTION 3.  Chapter 326, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§326-     County of Kalawao; cessation; county of Maui.  The county of Kalawao that consists of that portion of the island of Molokai known as Kalaupapa, Kalawao, and Waikolu, and commonly known or designated as the Kalaupapa Settlement, shall cease to constitute a county by itself and shall be and form a portion of the county of Maui." SECTION 4.  Section 326-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§326-1  [Establishment of facilities] Services for the treatment and care of persons with Hansen's disease.  The department of health, subject to the approval of the governor, shall [establish and maintain facilities and] provide services as are necessary for the care and treatment of persons with Hansen's disease and persons who were institutionalized for segregation by order of the department of health because of Hansen's disease. Every [such facility or] service provider shall exercise every reasonable effort to effect a cure of [those] persons[.] with Hansen's disease.  All [such] persons with Hansen's disease shall be cared for as well as circumstances will permit, in accordance with accepted medical practices. [Every patient shall be encouraged to take complete treatment so that prompt recovery can be attained. Isolation and treatment shall be compulsory only in those cases where, in the opinion of the department, that treatment is necessary to protect the health of the public, and the department may take such measures as may be necessary to enforce this section, including the adoption of rules pursuant to chapter 91.]" SECTION 5.  Section 326-13, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§326-13  Expenses; rules.  [(a)] The department of health shall bear all expenses of travel and other necessary expenses incurred under sections 326-1 to 326-14 and may adopt all rules and forms and perform all acts necessary and proper for carrying out their provisions.

SB1432 HD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1432 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO CHANGES TO RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CONCERNING PATIENTS, THE COUNTY OF KALAWAO, AND THE KALAUPAPA SETTLEMENT. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the population of former Hansen's disease patients residing at Kalaupapa in the county of Kalawao is aging.  There are currently seven individuals on the Kalaupapa registry who receive services from the State.  Four of them are full-time residents at Kalaupapa.  All these patients are age eighty-three years or older. The legislature finds that the county of Kalawao consists of that portion of the island of Molokai commonly known as the Kalaupapa Settlement and that the county of Kalawao is under the jurisdiction and control of the department of health and governed by the laws and rules relating to the department and the care and treatment of persons affected with Hansen's disease.  After the passing of the last full- or part-time patient resident at Kalaupapa, the department of health will no longer provide patient care there but intends to complete environmental remediation work. The legislature further finds that there are many other stakeholders that care about the future of the Kalaupapa Settlement and the preservation of the historical, cultural, and environmental significance of the county of Kalawao. This Act reflects preliminary sentiments expressed by some Maui county residents that the county of Kalawao be reunited with the county of Maui.  A transparent process and opportunity for more extensive public input regarding the transfer of jurisdiction and control of Kalawao county is required. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Prepare for changes to responsibilities of the department of health upon the passing of the last patient resident of the Kalaupapa Settlement; (2)  Commemorate and preserve the historical, cultural, and environmental significance of the peninsula and its residents in Hawaii's history with the establishment of the Kalaupapa state historical area; and (3)  Provide to the public the opportunity for input on the future of the county of Kalawao; and (4)  Require any future planning for the permanent transfer of the powers and duties of the department and any other state agency over Kalaupapa Settlement to other governmental or qualified non-governmental entities, to include a community organization in the county of Kalawao that is designated in P.L. 111-11, title VII, section 7108, and a topside community organization selected in consultation with the Molokai community. PART II SECTION 2.  Chapter 6E, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part II to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§6E-     Kalaupapa state historical area.  (a)  There shall be a Kalaupapa state historical area that shall consist of that portion of the island of Molokai known as Kalaupapa, Kalawao, and Waikolu, and commonly known or designated as the Kalaupapa Settlement. (b)  The Kalaupapa state historical area is established to preserve the Kalaupapa Settlement, educate the public, commemorate the lives of residents with Hansen's disease and the lives of the people who served them, and recognize the county of Kalawao and its role in the history of Hawaii." SECTION 3.  Chapter 326, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§326-     County of Kalawao; cessation; county of Maui.  The county of Kalawao that consists of that portion of the island of Molokai known as Kalaupapa, Kalawao, and Waikolu, and commonly known or designated as the Kalaupapa Settlement, shall cease to constitute a county by itself and shall be and form a portion of the county of Maui." SECTION 4.  Section 326-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§326-1  [Establishment of facilities] Services for the treatment and care of persons with Hansen's disease.  The department of health, subject to the approval of the governor, shall [establish and maintain facilities and] provide services as are necessary for the care and treatment of persons with Hansen's disease and persons who were institutionalized for segregation by order of the department of health because of Hansen's disease. Every [such facility or] service provider shall exercise every reasonable effort to effect a cure of [those] persons[.] with Hansen's disease.  All [such] persons with Hansen's disease shall be cared for as well as circumstances will permit, in accordance with accepted medical practices. [Every patient shall be encouraged to take complete treatment so that prompt recovery can be attained. Isolation and treatment shall be compulsory only in those cases where, in the opinion of the department, that treatment is necessary to protect the health of the public, and the department may take such measures as may be necessary to enforce this section, including the adoption of rules pursuant to chapter 91.]" SECTION 5.  Section 326-13, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§326-13  Expenses; rules.  [(a)] The department of health shall bear all expenses of travel and other necessary expenses incurred under sections 326-1 to 326-14 and may adopt all rules and forms and perform all acts necessary and proper for carrying out their provisions. [(b)  Expenses related to patients shall be tracked separately from nonpatient costs, whenever appropriate and possible.]" SECTION 6.  Section 326-24, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§326-24  Rules.
