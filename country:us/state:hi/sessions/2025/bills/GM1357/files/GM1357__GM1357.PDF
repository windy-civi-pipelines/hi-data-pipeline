STATE OF HAWAII ' S.D. 1
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO CANCER.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the cancer research
2 center of Hawaii, known as the university of Hawaii cancer
3 center, is one of seventy-one National Cancer Institute-
4 designated cancer centers in the United States. It is the only
5 center in Hawaii and the Pacific region. The legislature also
6 finds that the university of Hawaii cancer center reduces the
7 burden of cancer through research, education, patient care, and
8 community outreach, with an emphasis on the unique ethnic,
9 cultural, and environmental characteristics of Hawaii and the
10 Pacific region.
11 Cancer incidence and mortality rates have decreased in
12 Hawaii over the last decade, but despite this overall reduction,
13 the disparities between ethnic populations continue to be of
14 concern. Native Hawaiians continue to have the highest cancer
15 incidence and mortality rates among men and women, including
16 higher incidences of breast and ovarian cancers. Similarly,
17 Filipino women have the highest incidences of ovarian and

1 thyroid cancer. The legislature recognizes the need to identify
2 the root causes of these disparities. This includes determining
3 the health risks associated with living in close proximity to
4 certain environmental hazards and exposures, specifically the
5 impact of county and private waste landfills in Nanakuli, Oahu,
6 on the surrounding Native Hawaiian communities. The legislature
7 finds that cancer research focusing on Native Hawaiians, Pacific
8 Islanders, and Filipinos is a matter of statewide concern and is
9 unique to Hawaii and the university of Hawaii cancer center and
10 thus cannot be easily conducted anywhere else in the world.
11 The purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds to the
12 university of Hawaii cancer center for a multiethnic cohort
13 study focusing on the social determinants of health, lifestyles,
14 environmental exposures, and resilience factors of Native
15 Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and Filipinos, including an
16 analysis of the health effects and risks of individuals living
17 in close proximity to both landfills in Nanakuli, Oahu.
18 SECTION 2. There is appropriated out of the general
19 revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $500,000 or so much
20 thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the
21 same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year

C.D. 1
1 2026-2027 for the university of Hawaii cancer center to conduct
2 a multiethnic cohort study focusing on the social determinants
3 of health, lifestyles, environmental exposures, and resilience
4 factors of Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and Filipinos,
5 including an analysis of the health effects and risks of
6 individuals living in close proximity to landfills in Nanakuli,
7 Oahu; provided that the analysis shall utilize water and soil
8 sample data from the department of health and other agencies.
9 The sums appropriated shall be expended by the university
10 of Hawaii for the purposes of this Act.
11 SECTION 3. The university of Hawaii cancer center shall
12 seek other sources of funding, in addition to the funds
13 appropriated by this Act, to complete the multiethnic cohort
14 study identified in section 2 of this Act.
15 SECTION 4. This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2025.
