Section 1:
HB1466 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1466 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to social gaming. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that a facility for social gaming will provide a safe place for alternative entertainment, create jobs, and generate revenue for the State of Hawaii and community-based programs. The legislature believes that job creation and career opportunities are two of highest factors for Hawaii residents to feel secure and optimistic. Developing a new social gaming industry will establish a new revenue path outside of the overreliance on taxing transactions at Hawaii's beaches, hotels, restaurants, and bars. The legislature also finds that social gaming through poker, cribbage, rummy, bridge, and other card games is not gambling since individual skill is the predominant factor to winning, in comparison to lotteries, contests of chance, and various casino games.  Social gaming also offers no house odds for any game.  Social gaming may include prizes and consideration, entry fees and guaranteed prize winnings, so long as all lawful participants have equal access and equal opportunity, notwithstanding that individual skill, strategy, and experience are expected to deliver unequal outcomes among participants in any individual game or contest.  When participants enjoy competition among themselves and no house, house odds, house player, or other house interest exists in the games, contests, or the decisions and outcomes of those games and contests, everybody wins. A licensed facility can serve the purpose of providing a safe, clean, and fair place to play and ensures the consistency and accuracy of all games and all contests to all participants. The legislature also believes that the facility can also serve to monitor and measure each game or contest to ensure operational integrity and to collect and distribute a per-hand, per-game, or per-contest charge based on the volume of gameplay, and deliver a percentage of the collection first to the State of Hawaii. In addition to charging and collecting a participation fee for the State of Hawaii, the facility will also charge, collect, and deliver a percentage of the collection to community-based programs focusing on solutions to housing challenges.  The facility may also earn its revenue by charging participants to play in social games, and by selling food and beverages.  Individual game operators and supervisors may earn their incomes via wages and tips from participants. The legislature rejects any argument that any existing entities may open a gaming facility or gambling casino in Hawaii pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which authorized the establishment of hundreds of Native American gaming operations in other states.  According to the National Indian Gaming Association, there are no federally recognized Native American nations indigenous to Hawaii, and therefore a Native American gaming operation would not be permissible in Hawaii under the Act. The legislature believes it owes a duty to protect, preserve, and help provide improved opportunities for all Native Hawaiians, with additional emphasis on quality of life improvements.  Any program for which Native Hawaiians are the primary beneficiaries shall be considered thoroughly and encouraged if possible. This legislature additionally believes that its paramount objective is to serve its constituents as beneficiaries of every strategic plan that becomes an act, with innovative new bills, and with stewardship.  In order to better serve the current and future strategic plans, the legislature ought to consider best practices to improve funding and supplement Hawaii's financial resource programs.  One key objective to the protection of the well-being of the State of Hawaii and its residents is to diversify and to increase revenue streams. Increased revenues equal increased funding for local community programs, including the economic self-sufficiency and housing programs for Native Hawaiians.  Increasing housing security, home ownership, and the average household income for Native Hawaiians is paramount to meeting every other objective. This Act will positively contribute to new job creation with priority hiring and training of Native Hawaiians, and additional funding which is desperately needed for the houseless crisis. This legislative body of the great State of Hawaii is charged with the responsibility to protect and improve the lives of Native Hawaiians by creating and maintaining more vibrant housing opportunities through economic stability initiatives.  This Act provides for a development team that includes Native Hawaiians who share the same goals as this legislature, and are eager to pursue opportunities that are preparing Native Hawaiian communities for a better future with increases housing availability and security.  The unmatched beauty of Hawaii guarantees its economic success in travel, tourism, and hospitality.  Improving the social and recreational opportunities, with a focus on visitors' economic impact, can drive substantial revenue toward the general and specific budgets.  As the legislature seeks alternative revenue streams for housing, health, educational, and employment opportunities, billions of tourism dollars are finding their way to other states for entertainment and recreation. It is often said that Las Vegas is Hawaii's ninth island.  Nearly twenty-five per cent of Hawaii's citizens visit Las Vegas annually and a substantially greater percentage of Hawaii's international visitors continue to Las Vegas for further tourism, entertainment, and recreation.  Japanese travelers including Hawaii in their itineraries spent over $40,000,000 last year in their supplemental visits to Las Vegas. Travel and tourism research has shown that more than seventy per cent of Japanese, Chinese, and Korean visitors to Hawaii have also recently traveled to Las Vegas, or plan to within twelve months, and would seek to visit a "casino or gambling facility," or would approve of a "casino or gambling facility" in Hawaii.  While the gambling aspect will not be delivered to these visitors through this Act, the entertainment, recreation, social enjoyment, and competition aspects will delivered.  Other states that have authorized social gaming facilities and non-casino card rooms have experienced a decline in unlawful gambling activities and associated crime in the same and nearby municipalities, and have also enjoyed billions of dollars in job-created growth for their local economies.  Time and money that may have been spent in Las Vegas remained in part within each respective state.  Oregon and California both specifically authorize gaming and social gaming facilities.  The best practices of each state have be incorporated into this Act.  Social gaming has a traditional and cultural history in Hawaii, with contests of skill rather than chance.  Games of Makahiki included variations of checkers, darts, sticks, and stones.  These sports and games were usually played individually or as a team and participants wagered with one another, and without any odds or negative expectation.  These were games of strategy, practice, strength, speed, memory, observation, and intelligence.  Players always holding a fair and equal opportunity to win, and their individual skill being the predominant factor, was a key factor. Today's versions of these skill-based games include board games, card games, and social sports:  chess, checkers, poker, rummy, cribbage, darts, pool, bowling, and more.  A social gaming facility specializing in offering some of these games, contests, and events will be celebrated by traditional Hawaiian culture advocates and newly employed Hawaiians alike. Creating a safe, fun, and fair place for locals and visitors to gather, together, to compete socially in games and tournaments, and to enjoy friendly competitions that also benefit Hawaii's general and specific budgets is the primary goal.  The power to review, authorize, license, and even grant or exclude land use for this specified use is within the full control of the legislature.  The legislature may specifically authorize and adopt rules regarding the time, place, supervision, and the play of social games. The legislature further finds that, according to a 2022 report, fifty-two per cent of homeless individuals on Oahu identify as "Native Hawaiian and Pacific islander" as their only race or as part of their multiracial identity. This Act will aim to address the disproportionate number of Native Hawaiians and Pacific islanders suffering from lack of affordable housing by allocating a per-hand, per-game, or per-contest fee for all players. The purpose of this Act is to authorize social gaming with a portion of the revenues to support housing programs.

(f)  The social gaming licensee, an affiliate, or affiliated company shall immediately notify the commission of any information concerning an institutional investor holding its equity or debt securities that may affect the eligibility and suitability of the institutional investor for a waiver under this section. (g)  If the commission finds that an institutional investor, holding any security of an affiliate or affiliated company of a social gaming licensee that is related in any way to the financing of the social gaming licensee, fails to comply with the requirements of this section, or if at any time the commission finds that, by reason of the extent or nature of its holdings, an institutional investor is in a position to exercise a substantial impact upon the controlling interests of a social gaming licensee, the commission may take any necessary action to protect the public interest, including requiring the institutional investor to satisfy eligibility and suitability requirements. §   -307  Bond of social gaming licensee.  Before a social gaming license is issued, the licensee shall file a bond in the sum of $200,000 with the department.  The bond shall be used to guarantee that the licensee faithfully makes the payments, keeps books and records, makes reports, and conducts games of skill, in conformity with this chapter and rules adopted by the commission.  The bond shall not be canceled by a surety less than thirty days after providing written notice to the commission.  If a bond is canceled and the licensee fails to file a new bond with the commission in the required amount on or before the effective date of cancellation, the licensee's license shall be revoked.  The total and aggregate liability of the surety on the bond shall be limited to the amount specified in the bond. §   -308  Social Gaming license; term.  The term of the social gaming license shall be ten years and shall be renewable for additional ten-year terms according to rules adopted by the commission. §   -309  Revocation of social gaming license.  The commission may revoke the social gaming license if the licensee fails to begin regular gaming operations within twelve months of receipt of the commission's approval of the application or twelve months after a certificate of occupancy for the facility is first issued, whichever is later, upon a finding by the commission that the license revocation is in the best interest of the State. §   -310  Social Gaming licensee or applicant; prohibitions; ex parte communications.  (a)  A licensee or applicant shall not knowingly initiate a negotiation for, or discussion of, employment with a member, employee, or agent of the commission.  A licensee or applicant who initiates a negotiation or discussion about employment shall immediately provide written notice of the details of the negotiation or discussion to the chairperson as soon as that person becomes aware that the negotiation or discussion has been initiated with a member, employee, or agent of the commission.

HB1466 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1466 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to social gaming. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that a facility for social gaming will provide a safe place for alternative entertainment, create jobs, and generate revenue for the State of Hawaii and community-based programs. The legislature believes that job creation and career opportunities are two of highest factors for Hawaii residents to feel secure and optimistic. Developing a new social gaming industry will establish a new revenue path outside of the overreliance on taxing transactions at Hawaii's beaches, hotels, restaurants, and bars. The legislature also finds that social gaming through poker, cribbage, rummy, bridge, and other card games is not gambling since individual skill is the predominant factor to winning, in comparison to lotteries, contests of chance, and various casino games.  Social gaming also offers no house odds for any game.  Social gaming may include prizes and consideration, entry fees and guaranteed prize winnings, so long as all lawful participants have equal access and equal opportunity, notwithstanding that individual skill, strategy, and experience are expected to deliver unequal outcomes among participants in any individual game or contest.  When participants enjoy competition among themselves and no house, house odds, house player, or other house interest exists in the games, contests, or the decisions and outcomes of those games and contests, everybody wins. A licensed facility can serve the purpose of providing a safe, clean, and fair place to play and ensures the consistency and accuracy of all games and all contests to all participants. The legislature also believes that the facility can also serve to monitor and measure each game or contest to ensure operational integrity and to collect and distribute a per-hand, per-game, or per-contest charge based on the volume of gameplay, and deliver a percentage of the collection first to the State of Hawaii. In addition to charging and collecting a participation fee for the State of Hawaii, the facility will also charge, collect, and deliver a percentage of the collection to community-based programs focusing on solutions to housing challenges.  The facility may also earn its revenue by charging participants to play in social games, and by selling food and beverages.  Individual game operators and supervisors may earn their incomes via wages and tips from participants. The legislature rejects any argument that any existing entities may open a gaming facility or gambling casino in Hawaii pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which authorized the establishment of hundreds of Native American gaming operations in other states.  According to the National Indian Gaming Association, there are no federally recognized Native American nations indigenous to Hawaii, and therefore a Native American gaming operation would not be permissible in Hawaii under the Act. The legislature believes it owes a duty to protect, preserve, and help provide improved opportunities for all Native Hawaiians, with additional emphasis on quality of life improvements.  Any program for which Native Hawaiians are the primary beneficiaries shall be considered thoroughly and encouraged if possible. This legislature additionally believes that its paramount objective is to serve its constituents as beneficiaries of every strategic plan that becomes an act, with innovative new bills, and with stewardship.  In order to better serve the current and future strategic plans, the legislature ought to consider best practices to improve funding and supplement Hawaii's financial resource programs.  One key objective to the protection of the well-being of the State of Hawaii and its residents is to diversify and to increase revenue streams. Increased revenues equal increased funding for local community programs, including the economic self-sufficiency and housing programs for Native Hawaiians.  Increasing housing security, home ownership, and the average household income for Native Hawaiians is paramount to meeting every other objective. This Act will positively contribute to new job creation with priority hiring and training of Native Hawaiians, and additional funding which is desperately needed for the houseless crisis. This legislative body of the great State of Hawaii is charged with the responsibility to protect and improve the lives of Native Hawaiians by creating and maintaining more vibrant housing opportunities through economic stability initiatives.  This Act provides for a development team that includes Native Hawaiians who share the same goals as this legislature, and are eager to pursue opportunities that are preparing Native Hawaiian communities for a better future with increases housing availability and security.  The unmatched beauty of Hawaii guarantees its economic success in travel, tourism, and hospitality.  Improving the social and recreational opportunities, with a focus on visitors' economic impact, can drive substantial revenue toward the general and specific budgets.  As the legislature seeks alternative revenue streams for housing, health, educational, and employment opportunities, billions of tourism dollars are finding their way to other states for entertainment and recreation. It is often said that Las Vegas is Hawaii's ninth island.  Nearly twenty-five per cent of Hawaii's citizens visit Las Vegas annually and a substantially greater percentage of Hawaii's international visitors continue to Las Vegas for further tourism, entertainment, and recreation.  Japanese travelers including Hawaii in their itineraries spent over $40,000,000 last year in their supplemental visits to Las Vegas. Travel and tourism research has shown that more than seventy per cent of Japanese, Chinese, and Korean visitors to Hawaii have also recently traveled to Las Vegas, or plan to within twelve months, and would seek to visit a "casino or gambling facility," or would approve of a "casino or gambling facility" in Hawaii.  While the gambling aspect will not be delivered to these visitors through this Act, the entertainment, recreation, social enjoyment, and competition aspects will delivered.  Other states that have authorized social gaming facilities and non-casino card rooms have experienced a decline in unlawful gambling activities and associated crime in the same and nearby municipalities, and have also enjoyed billions of dollars in job-created growth for their local economies.  Time and money that may have been spent in Las Vegas remained in part within each respective state.  Oregon and California both specifically authorize gaming and social gaming facilities.  The best practices of each state have be incorporated into this Act.  Social gaming has a traditional and cultural history in Hawaii, with contests of skill rather than chance.  Games of Makahiki included variations of checkers, darts, sticks, and stones.  These sports and games were usually played individually or as a team and participants wagered with one another, and without any odds or negative expectation.  These were games of strategy, practice, strength, speed, memory, observation, and intelligence.  Players always holding a fair and equal opportunity to win, and their individual skill being the predominant factor, was a key factor. Today's versions of these skill-based games include board games, card games, and social sports:  chess, checkers, poker, rummy, cribbage, darts, pool, bowling, and more.  A social gaming facility specializing in offering some of these games, contests, and events will be celebrated by traditional Hawaiian culture advocates and newly employed Hawaiians alike. Creating a safe, fun, and fair place for locals and visitors to gather, together, to compete socially in games and tournaments, and to enjoy friendly competitions that also benefit Hawaii's general and specific budgets is the primary goal.  The power to review, authorize, license, and even grant or exclude land use for this specified use is within the full control of the legislature.  The legislature may specifically authorize and adopt rules regarding the time, place, supervision, and the play of social games. The legislature further finds that, according to a 2022 report, fifty-two per cent of homeless individuals on Oahu identify as "Native Hawaiian and Pacific islander" as their only race or as part of their multiracial identity. This Act will aim to address the disproportionate number of Native Hawaiians and Pacific islanders suffering from lack of affordable housing by allocating a per-hand, per-game, or per-contest fee for all players. The purpose of this Act is to authorize social gaming with a portion of the revenues to support housing programs.
