Section 1:
SB1034 SD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1034 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE FOOD SERVICE INDUSTRY. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the State is committed to upholding the dignity and well-being of its workforce, recognizing that fair and just labor practices are essential to the health, safety, and economic security of its workers.  In turn, food service workers form a cornerstone of the State's economy, contributing to its vibrant hospitality and culinary industries while often working in physically demanding and high-stress environments. The legislature further finds that the State currently lacks basic labor laws requiring employers to provide meal breaks for employees, leading to widespread reports of food service workers being denied sufficient time to rest, eat, and recharge during long shifts, creating unsustainable working conditions. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to require employers in the food service industry to provide a thirty‑minute unpaid break for consumption of a meal for all employees working five or more consecutive hours, ensuring that workers have access to proper nourishment and rest during their shifts. SECTION 2. Chapter 387, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§387-    Food service employees; unpaid rest periods.  (a)  All employers in the food service industry shall allow their employees an unpaid rest period of at least thirty consecutive minutes for each       consecutive hours of working time. (b) For the purposes of this section, "food service industry" means businesses that produce, prepare, serve, or sell food and or beverages to customers for consumption.  "Food service industry" includes restaurants, cafeterias, bars, catering services, and food trucks." SECTION 3. New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 4. This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2050. Report Title: Food Service Industry; Food Service Employees; Work Hours; Unpaid Rest Periods Description: Requires employers in the food service industry to allow their employees an unpaid rest period of 30 consecutive minutes for a certain number of consecutive hours of working time.  Effective 7/1/2050.  (SD1) The summary description of legislation appearing on this page is for informational purposes only and is not legislation or evidence of legislative intent.
