HB303 HD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 303 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO HEALTHCARE PRECEPTORS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that there is a shortage of health care providers in the State, particularly primary care providers, which will be exacerbated by the projected retirement of current physicians, advanced practice registered nurses, pharmacists, and other health care workers.  Although students are interested in pursuing careers in Hawaii's health care service industry, in-state educational institutions are constrained by the lack of clinical education sites in the State and the limited supply of qualified preceptors.  One way to encourage the participation of preceptors is to offer an income tax credit for health care professionals who serve as preceptors. The purpose of the existing healthcare preceptor income tax credit is to incentivize volunteer preceptors to offer professional instruction, training, and supervision to students and residents seeking careers as health care providers in the State.  The legislature finds that although many providers have trained eligible students, modifications to the exiting program will amplify the success of the program. The legislature further finds that the preceptor tax credit program has been successful in facilitating the growth of the preceptor program.  The five-year evaluation of the program found a seventy-seven per cent increase in active preceptors who taught at least one rotation, and seventy-six providers started precepting during this five-year period. The report also recommended that to improve the function of the program, additional health care provider professions that have established schools in Hawaii should be added to the tax credit eligibility, the primary care specialty requirement for preceptors should be removed, and the requirement that the preceptor credit should only be for precepting students enrolled in a primary care program should be removed. The legislature recognizes that programs training physicians, advanced practice registered nurses, and pharmacists in primary care also require training from specialty preceptors.  The legislature further recognizes that the health care workforce has shortages in professions beyond those included in the tax credit and whose workforce expansion is also limited by available preceptors, including social workers, physician assistants, and registered dieticians, as well as workers in high-demand specialties such as behavioral health.  As such, the healthcare preceptor tax credit should not be limited to physicians, advanced practice registered nurses, and pharmacists and should be expanded to be applied across all eligible professions. Finally, the legislature finds that the definition of "volunteer-based supervised clinical training rotation" should be clarified to facilitate the preceptor credit assurance committee's implementation of the tax credit. Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Amend the definitions of "preceptor" and "volunteer‑based supervised clinical training rotation" to improve accessibility for providers to receive income tax credits for acting as preceptors, including removing "primary care" from the criteria to qualify as a preceptor; (2)  Add physician assistants, social workers, and licensed dieticians to the list of preceptors and in the definition of "eligible student"; (3)  Expand eligibility for the tax credit to include accredited residency programs that require preceptor support; and (4)  Revise the membership of the preceptor credit assurance committee to include the director of health and residency programs with eligible students. SECTION 2.  Section 235-110.25, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (g) to read as follows: "(g)  For the purposes of this section: "Academic program" means an academic degree granting program or graduate medical education program that: (1)  Holds either its principal accreditation or a physical location in Hawaii; and (2)  Provides education to students, of whom more than fifty per cent are residents of Hawaii.
