Section 1:
SB1265 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1265 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to condominium associations. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that while condominium self-governance can be successful in the State, there have been many cases of abuse of power and other acts of malfeasance by certain association boards, association management, managing agents and their employees, and association attorneys clogging courts with litigation. This is further evidenced by public statements by leading insurance professionals that Hawaii has the highest number of association directors' and officers' liability insurance claims in the nation, assertions that are more alarming because Hawaii has comparatively fewer homeowners associations than other states.  The legislature also finds that a central enforcement body is needed to address systemic problems faced by many condominium owners who are subjected to retribution and retaliation from boards and their members, association management, managing agents and their employees, and others representing the association. This retaliation harasses owners and impacts them emotionally and financially, with unwarranted and improper fines, assessments, legal costs, and foreclosures. Based on reviews of the department of commerce and consumer affairs reports published in the Hawaii Condominium Bulletin since 2016, mediation subsidized by the condominium education trust fund has not been successful, with nearly two out of every three cases unresolved, mediated to "no agreement," or withdrawn because one or more parties declined to participate. During the same period, nearly eight out of every ten mediated cases were filed by owners against their associations, and more than nine out of ten cases alleged breaches of the association's governing documents.  Owners also sought alternative dispute resolution to address noncompliance with chapter 514B, Hawaii Revised Statutes. The legislature also finds that the major advantages of mediation are to resolve disputes, alleviate the costs associated with the dispute resolution, and lessen the burden on the courts.  However, to initiate the condominium education trust fund subsidized mediation process, each party must risk at least $375 when the promise of resolution is so small.  Even when parties reach a written agreement, the enforcement of that agreement is not assured, making some resolutions ineffective unless the parties go to court. Although mediation is mandatory in many cases, some associations' boards knowingly do not participate, pressuring the owner to go to court to enforce the resolution. Additionally, owners who continued the mediation process reported feeling compelled to retain an attorney, often at a prohibitive cost, because the association was represented by an attorney and, in many cases, with additional legal assistance from the attorneys representing the association's insurer. If the mediation settlement is favorable to the owner, all association owners, including the owner participating in the mediation, are required to pay the association's legal fees, sometimes through onerous special assessments, and suffer increased association insurance premium costs, increased deductibles, or the loss of coverage. The actual results of subsidized mediation have negated its intended advantages. Fair judicial proceedings have been denied to those who could not afford legal counsel, and the system has benefitted a favored group rather than the public good. The legislature further finds that many owners complain that the participating attorneys are the only "winners" in their cases.  This is substantiated by those who testified regarding the success of mediations, as the mediators or attorneys had a pecuniary interest in the mediation process. The actual outcomes of arbitration cases subsidized by the department of commerce and consumer affairs are not available.  However, arbitration is recognized as an expensive means of dispute resolution and the expense of the undertaking can be cost prohibitive, resulting in a denial of justice for association members. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Establish within the department of commerce and consumer affairs an ombudsman's office for condominium associations to: (A)  Serve as a neutral resource for members of condominium associations and the public; (B)  Provide an office for condominium association unit owners, boards, board members, association management, and managing agents to bring complaints for investigation and dispute resolution; (C)  Ensure compliance with existing laws and association governing documents; (D)  Resolve disputes without burdensome and excessive legal expenses, which include attorneys fees, mediation costs beyond what is subsidized, court costs, lost wages for missed work, and other costs; (E)  Ensure association members have access to association documents; (F)  The ombudsman shall develop policies and procedures to assist unit owners, boards of directors, board members, community association managers, and other affected parties to understand their rights and responsibilities as set forth in chapter 514B, Hawaii Revised Statutes, and the condominium documents governing their respective association; and (G)  Maintain data on inquiries and complaints received, types of assistance requested, notices of decisions, actions taken, and the disposition of matters; and (2)  Establish funding for the ombudsmans office for condominium associations from the condominium education trust fund, with no impact on the States general fund. SECTION 2.  Chapter 514B, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part OMBUDSMAN'S OFFICE FOR CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATIONS §514B-A  Ombudsman's office for condominium associations established; ombudsman; criteria for ombudsman.  (a) There is established within the department of commerce and consumer affairs an ombudsman's office for condominium associations.  The ombudsman's office for condominium associations shall be headed by the ombudsman for condominium associations, who shall be appointed by the director of commerce and consumer affairs with the approval of the governor.

Otherwise, the association shall not regulate any use of or behavior in units by means of the rules and regulations. (c) Any payments made by or on behalf of a unit owner shall first be applied to outstanding common expenses that are assessed to all unit owners in proportion to the common interest appurtenant to their respective units, including commercial property assessed financing assessment expenses incurred for improvements financed pursuant to section 196-64.5.  Only after the outstanding common expenses have been paid in full may the payments be applied to other charges owed to the association, including assessed charges to the unit such as ground lease rent, utility sub-metering, storage lockers, parking stalls, boat slips, insurance deductibles, and cable.  After these charges are paid, other charges, including unpaid late fees, legal fees, fines, and interest, may be assessed in accordance with an application of payment policy adopted by the board; provided that if a unit owner has designated that any payment is for a specific charge that is not a common expense as described in this subsection, the payment may be applied in accordance with the unit owner's designation even if common expenses remain outstanding. (d) No unit owner who requests legal or other information from the association, the board, the managing agent, or their employees or agents, shall be charged for the reasonable cost of providing the information unless the association notifies the unit owner that it intends to charge the unit owner for the reasonable cost.  The association shall notify the unit owner in writing at least ten days prior to incurring the reasonable cost of providing the information, except that no prior notice shall be required to assess the reasonable cost of providing information on delinquent assessments or in connection with proceedings to enforce the law or the association's governing documents. After being notified of the reasonable cost of providing the information, the unit owner may withdraw the request, in writing.  A unit owner who withdraws a request for information shall not be charged for the reasonable cost of providing the information. (e) Subject to any approval requirements and spending limits contained in the declaration or bylaws, the association may authorize the board to borrow money for the repair, replacement, maintenance, operation, or administration of the common elements and personal property of the project, or the making of any additions, alterations, and improvements thereto; provided that the board shall make available any reports provided by licensed or certified professionals that document the necessity and urgency of that expenditure, provide to all unit owners a written notice of the purpose and use of the funds [is first sent to all unit owners and owners], and hold a special meeting to discuss the expenditure and review the reports. Owners representing more than fifty per cent of the common interest shall vote [or] and give written consent to the borrowing. In connection with the borrowing, including non‑commercial property assessed financing, the board may grant to the lender the right to assess and collect monthly or special assessments from the unit owners and to enforce the payment of the assessments or other sums by statutory lien and foreclosure proceedings.  The cost of the borrowing, including, without limitation, all principal, interest, commitment fees, and other expenses payable with respect to the borrowing or the enforcement of the obligations under the borrowing, shall be a common expense of the project.  For purposes of this section, the financing of insurance premiums by the association within the policy period shall not be deemed a loan and no lease shall be deemed a loan if it provides that at the end of the lease the association may purchase the leased equipment for its fair market value. (f) For financing assessments imposed upon the project under a commercial property assessed financing program pursuant to section 196-64.5 and due from the association, the cost of the commercial property assessed financing, including all principal, interest, commitment fees, servicing fees, and other expenses payable with respect to this borrowing or the enforcement of the obligations under the borrowing, shall be a common expense of the project and the unit owners' proportionate share of the financing assessment shall be collected in the same manner as common expenses.  The written consent of at least fifty per cent of all unit owners to finance qualifying improvements with commercial property assessed financing shall include an acknowledgment that the annual financing assessment required to fund debt service on the commercial property assessed financing shall be included as part of the association's adopted revised budget. (g)  If the association or the board is involved in a dispute intervention and resolution request through the ombudsman's office pursuant to section 514B-D, no special assessment related to the dispute, including association attorneys' fees, shall be assessed or collected from unit owners until the ombudsman's office has completed an investigation and rendered a final decision.  If the final decision is in favor of the unit owner, any and all assessments, fines, costs, expenses, interest, and legal fees improperly assessed to the unit owner shall be reversed.  Any board member who is found to have committed willful misconduct in violation of any laws or the governing documents shall be removed from the board by the authority of the ombudsman."

Raw Text:
SB1265 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1265 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to condominium associations. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that while condominium self-governance can be successful in the State, there have been many cases of abuse of power and other acts of malfeasance by certain association boards, association management, managing agents and their employees, and association attorneys clogging courts with litigation. This is further evidenced by public statements by leading insurance professionals that Hawaii has the highest number of association directors' and officers' liability insurance claims in the nation, assertions that are more alarming because Hawaii has comparatively fewer homeowners associations than other states.  The legislature also finds that a central enforcement body is needed to address systemic problems faced by many condominium owners who are subjected to retribution and retaliation from boards and their members, association management, managing agents and their employees, and others representing the association. This retaliation harasses owners and impacts them emotionally and financially, with unwarranted and improper fines, assessments, legal costs, and foreclosures. Based on reviews of the department of commerce and consumer affairs reports published in the Hawaii Condominium Bulletin since 2016, mediation subsidized by the condominium education trust fund has not been successful, with nearly two out of every three cases unresolved, mediated to "no agreement," or withdrawn because one or more parties declined to participate. During the same period, nearly eight out of every ten mediated cases were filed by owners against their associations, and more than nine out of ten cases alleged breaches of the association's governing documents.  Owners also sought alternative dispute resolution to address noncompliance with chapter 514B, Hawaii Revised Statutes. The legislature also finds that the major advantages of mediation are to resolve disputes, alleviate the costs associated with the dispute resolution, and lessen the burden on the courts.  However, to initiate the condominium education trust fund subsidized mediation process, each party must risk at least $375 when the promise of resolution is so small.  Even when parties reach a written agreement, the enforcement of that agreement is not assured, making some resolutions ineffective unless the parties go to court. Although mediation is mandatory in many cases, some associations' boards knowingly do not participate, pressuring the owner to go to court to enforce the resolution. Additionally, owners who continued the mediation process reported feeling compelled to retain an attorney, often at a prohibitive cost, because the association was represented by an attorney and, in many cases, with additional legal assistance from the attorneys representing the association's insurer. If the mediation settlement is favorable to the owner, all association owners, including the owner participating in the mediation, are required to pay the association's legal fees, sometimes through onerous special assessments, and suffer increased association insurance premium costs, increased deductibles, or the loss of coverage. The actual results of subsidized mediation have negated its intended advantages. Fair judicial proceedings have been denied to those who could not afford legal counsel, and the system has benefitted a favored group rather than the public good. The legislature further finds that many owners complain that the participating attorneys are the only "winners" in their cases.  This is substantiated by those who testified regarding the success of mediations, as the mediators or attorneys had a pecuniary interest in the mediation process. The actual outcomes of arbitration cases subsidized by the department of commerce and consumer affairs are not available.  However, arbitration is recognized as an expensive means of dispute resolution and the expense of the undertaking can be cost prohibitive, resulting in a denial of justice for association members. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Establish within the department of commerce and consumer affairs an ombudsman's office for condominium associations to: (A)  Serve as a neutral resource for members of condominium associations and the public; (B)  Provide an office for condominium association unit owners, boards, board members, association management, and managing agents to bring complaints for investigation and dispute resolution; (C)  Ensure compliance with existing laws and association governing documents; (D)  Resolve disputes without burdensome and excessive legal expenses, which include attorneys fees, mediation costs beyond what is subsidized, court costs, lost wages for missed work, and other costs; (E)  Ensure association members have access to association documents; (F)  The ombudsman shall develop policies and procedures to assist unit owners, boards of directors, board members, community association managers, and other affected parties to understand their rights and responsibilities as set forth in chapter 514B, Hawaii Revised Statutes, and the condominium documents governing their respective association; and (G)  Maintain data on inquiries and complaints received, types of assistance requested, notices of decisions, actions taken, and the disposition of matters; and (2)  Establish funding for the ombudsmans office for condominium associations from the condominium education trust fund, with no impact on the States general fund.
