Section 1:
HB1225 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1225 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT Relating to mental health. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii's current standard for involuntary hospitalization does not adequately prevent harm either to members of the public or persons suffering from mental illness or substance abuse.  By requiring proof that a person is "imminently dangerous to self or others", the law essentially requires the point of danger--and thus potential harm--to have already been reached.  Instead, the standard should be more flexible to allow the person to receive treatment before the point of danger has been reached and avoidable harm occurs. The legislature notes that the National Alliance on Mental Illness, in its December 2016 public policy platform, asserts that states should "adopt broader, more flexible standards that would provide for involuntary commitment and/or court ordered treatment when an individual, due to mental illness is gravely disabled..." in addition to other grounds.  The policy platform defines a "gravely disabled" person as one who "is substantially unable...to provide for any of his or her basic needs, such as food, clothing, shelter, health or safety[.]"  The policy platform also explains that "requir[ing] proof of dangerousness often produce[s] unsatisfactory outcomes because individuals are allowed to deteriorate needlessly before involuntary commitment and/or court-ordered treatment can be instituted." The legislature acknowledges that, collectively, Act 221, Session Laws of Hawaii 2013, and Act 114, Session Laws of Hawaii 2016, deleted the term "gravely disabled" from the criteria for involuntary hospitalization and increased dependence on a danger-based definition, in furtherance of a pilot program for assisted community treatment that is now permanent.  Mentally ill persons who are gravely disabled may not be imminently dangerous to themselves or others, but still pose a very real danger to themselves or the public and thus should be covered by the law.  While the legislature supports the continuation of the assisted community treatment program and its complementary role in treating mental illness and substance abuse on an outpatient basis, the legislature is cognizant that a portion of the mentally ill population, including the chronically homeless, are being deprived of urgent, medically appropriate mental health intervention that is best administered on an inpatient basis. The purpose of this Act is to protect mentally ill individuals and the public more effectively by amending the definition of "dangerous to self", defining the terms "gravely disabled" and "psychiatric deterioration", broadening the term of "imminently dangerous to self and others", and increasing the maximum period of emergency hospitalization.
