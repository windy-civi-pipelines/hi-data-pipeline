Section 1:
SB365 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 365 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO LEAF BLOWERS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that gasoline-powered leaf blowers have become a significant source of environmental and public health concerns, prompting calls for their ban.  One of the most pressing reasons to prohibit the sale of new gas-powered leaf blowers is the extreme noise pollution they create.  Operating at levels often ranging between eighty and one hundred decibels, gas-powered leaf blowers can cause hearing damage to users and bystanders with prolonged exposure.  This excessive noise also disrupts neighborhoods, schools, and businesses, while disturbing wildlife and compromising the quality of life for residents in urban and suburban areas.  By comparison, modern electric or battery-powered alternatives are much quieter and provide an effective solution without the unnecessary auditory strain. In addition to noise pollution, gas-powered leaf blowers are notorious for their environmental impact.  Most models use inefficient two-stroke engines, which burn a mixture of oil and gasoline and release significant amounts of pollutants into the air. Studies indicate these types of leaf blowers emit high levels of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and unburned hydrocarbonscontributing to smog and worsening air quality.  Shockingly, running a gas-powered leaf blower for just one hour can produce as much pollution as driving a car for hundreds of miles.  This level of emissions exacerbates climate change and directly impacts respiratory health, especially for children, the elderly, and those with preexisting conditions like asthma. Transitioning away from gas-powered leaf blowers is also increasingly practical.  Advances in electric and battery-powered technologies have made these alternatives more efficient, powerful, and affordable than ever.  Electric leaf blowers are not only quieter and cleaner but also much cheaper and easier maintain since they do not require fuel or frequent engine repairs.  Banning the sale of new gas-powered leaf blowers would accelerate the shift to cleaner options, reduce noise and air pollution while promoting a healthier and more sustainable environment, and would represent a meaningful step toward addressing climate concerns and protecting the well-being of individuals in the State. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to ban the sale of gasoline-powered leaf blowers. SECTION 2.  Section 342F-30.8, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§342F-30.8  Leaf blowers; weed whackers; restrictions[.]; prohibition of sale of gasoline-powered leaf blowers.  (a)  In any urban land use district, as designated pursuant to section 205-2, it shall be unlawful for any person to operate a leaf blower or weed whacker within a residential zone or within one hundred feet of a residential zone in the State, except between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. on any day except Sunday or a state or federal holiday, and between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. on Sunday or any state or federal holiday; provided that government entities, and agents acting on behalf of government entities, may use weed whackers during the prohibited hours in the case of an emergency as defined in section 127A-2. (b) Beginning January 1, 2027, it shall be unlawful for any person to sell or offer for sale a gasoline-powered leaf blower. [(b)] (c)  Violators shall be fined $50 for the first violation, $100 for the second violation, $200 for the third violation, and $500 for each subsequent violation. [(c) Government entities, and agents acting on behalf of government entities, shall not be subject to this section as it applies to leaf blowers.] (d) Any county may adopt a rule or ordinance that places stricter limitations on the use of leaf blowers or weed whackers than are in this section.  In case of a conflict between the requirements or limitations of this section and any county rule or ordinance regarding the use of leaf blowers or weed whackers, the more restrictive requirements shall apply. (e)  For the purposes of this section: "Gasoline-powered leaf blower" means any leaf blower that is powered by a two-stroke internal combustion engine. "Leaf blower" means any machine used to blow leaves, dirt, or other debris off sidewalks, driveways, lawns, and other surfaces. "State holiday" means any day established as a state holiday in section 8-1. "Weed whacker" means a gasoline or electric powered yard tool that uses either a flexible monofilament line (also known as a string or line trimmer) or revolving metal cutting blade intended to cut or trim grass and other vegetation." SECTION 3. Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 4. This Act shall take effect upon its approval. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: Gasoline-Powered Leaf Blowers; Noise and Air Pollution; Prohibition; Repeal Description: Beginning 1/1/2027, prohibits the sale or offer for sale of gasoline-powered leaf blowers.  Repeals the exemption on leaf blower restrictions for government agencies.
