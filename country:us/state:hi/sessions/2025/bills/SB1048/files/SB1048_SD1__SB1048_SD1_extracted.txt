SB1048 SD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1048 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO SOLICITATION OF FUNDS FROM THE PUBLIC. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Act 205, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024 (Act 205), was intended to regulate charitable fundraising platforms to ensure proper and transparent fundraising activities in the State. The legislature further finds that Act 205's well-intended language creates undue burdens on charitable fundraising platforms and, more importantly, potentially hampers and inhibits the ability of charitable organizations to respond and fundraise, especially in times of emergency and need. The legislature additionally finds that it would be prudent to amend Act 205 before its scheduled effective date of January 1, 2026, in a manner that would still achieve the important purposes of public protection, donor security, and transparency, but not overburden charitable fundraising platforms, charitable organizations, and the department of the attorney general, who oversees these activities. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to amend the language in Act 205 to clarify existing standards and safeguards in online crowdfunding. SECTION 2.  Section 467B-2.3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended as follows: 1. By amending its title and subsections (a) and (b) to read: "[[]§467B-2.3[]]  Charitable fundraising platforms; platform charities.  (a)  Each charitable fundraising platform shall be subject to the department's supervision for activities regulated by this section.  Before soliciting, permitting, or otherwise enabling any solicitations for purported charitable purposes, a charitable fundraising platform shall register with the department on a form or in a manner as provided by the department.  Registrations under this section shall be subject to an annual report and an annual renewal fee imposed by the department.  Fee revenues from this section shall be deposited into the solicitation of funds for charitable purposes special fund.

(e)  A charitable fundraising platform or platform charity shall only solicit, permit, or otherwise enable solicitations, or receive, control, or distribute funds from donations for purported charitable purposes for recipient charitable organizations or other charitable organizations in good standing.  To determine good standing of a recipient charitable organization or other charitable organization, a charitable fundraising platform [or platform charity] may rely on [electronic lists periodically published by the Internal Revenue Service, department of taxation, or department.] the department's registry." 3.  By amending subsection (i) to read: "(i)  The charitable fundraising platform or platform charity shall not divert or otherwise misuse any donations made for purported charitable purposes that the charitable fundraising platform or platform charity receives through solicitation on the charitable fundraising platform, and shall hold the donations in a separate account or accounts from other funds belonging to the charitable fundraising platform or platform charity.  The charitable fundraising platform or platform charity shall promptly ensure that donations and grants of recommended donations are sent to the recipient charitable organizations with an accounting of any fees assessed for processing the funds, and in accordance with any rules adopted by the department pursuant to chapter 91.  A platform charity shall be [vicariously] liable for [a charitable fundraising platform's] its misuse of funds[, and vice versa].  A charitable fundraising platform shall maintain and operate a process for complaints about any fundraising activity regulated by this chapter and shall investigate and make findings on complaints, and, at the request of the department, shall report its findings to the department along with its actions for resolution, including any full refunds of contributions."

SECTION 4.  Section 467B-9, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (d) to read as follows: "(d) No professional solicitor, charitable fundraising platform, or platform charity, and no agent, employee, independent contractor, or other person acting on behalf of the professional solicitor, charitable fundraising platform, or platform charity, shall solicit in the name of or on behalf of any charitable organization unless[:] the charitable fundraising platform or platform charity has obtained written consent pursuant to section 467B-2.3(a) or: (1)  The professional solicitor[, charitable fundraising platform, or platform charity] has obtained the written authorization of two officers of the organization, which authorization shall bear the signature of the professional solicitor[, charitable fundraising platform, or platform charity] and the officers of the charitable organization and shall expressly state on its face the period for which it is valid, which shall not exceed one year from the date of issuance, and has filed a copy of the written authorization with the attorney general prior to the solicitation; and (2)  The professional solicitor[, charitable fundraising platform, or platform charity] and any person who, for compensation, acts as an agent, employee, independent contractor, or otherwise on behalf of the professional solicitor, [charitable fundraising platform, or platform charity,] carries a copy of the authorization while conducting solicitations, and exhibits it on request to persons solicited or police officers or agents of the department."
