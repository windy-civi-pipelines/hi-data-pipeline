SB1048 HD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1048 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO SOLICITATION OF FUNDS FROM THE PUBLIC. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Act 205, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024 (Act 205), was intended to regulate charitable fundraising platforms to ensure proper and transparent fundraising activities in the State. The legislature further finds that Act 205's well-intended language creates undue burdens on charitable fundraising platforms and, more importantly, potentially hampers and inhibits the ability of charitable organizations to respond and fundraise, especially in times of emergency and need. The legislature additionally finds that it would be prudent to amend Act 205 before its scheduled effective date of January 1, 2026, in a manner that would still achieve the important purposes of public protection, donor security, and transparency, but not overburden charitable fundraising platforms, charitable organizations, and the department of the attorney general, who oversees these activities. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to amend the language in Act 205 to clarify existing standards and safeguards in online crowdfunding. SECTION 2.  Chapter 467B, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§467B-     Platform charities.  (a)  Every platform charity not exempted by section 467B-11.5 shall register with the department as a platform charity before conducting activities regulated by this chapter in accordance with section 467B-2.1.  A platform charity shall be subject to the annual financial report and annual filing fee requirements of section 467B-6.5.  Each report shall: (1)  Enable the department to ascertain whether charitable funds have been properly solicited, received, held, controlled, or distributed; (2)  Provide information on the number of donations made, amount raised, length of time for distributing donations or grants of recommended donations, fees charged by or through a charitable fundraising platform or platform charity, and names of recipient charitable organizations or other charitable organizations that were sent or have not yet been sent donations or grants of recommended donations; and (3)  Protect from disclosure any personally identifiable information of donors or other users of the charitable fundraising platform. (b) No platform charity shall facilitate acts of solicitation on a charitable fundraising platform unless the platform charity is in good standing. (c)  A platform charity shall only solicit, permit, or otherwise enable solicitations or receive, control, or distribute funds from donations for purported charitable purposes for recipient charitable organizations or other charitable organizations in good standing.  To determine good standing of a recipient charitable organization or other charitable organization, a platform charity may rely on information displayed on the department's registry. (d)  With respect to purported charitable purposes, a platform charity that performs, permits, or otherwise enables solicitation activities shall, before a person can complete a donation or select or change a recipient charitable organization, provide conspicuous disclosures that reduce the likelihood of deception, confusion, or misunderstanding, including: (1)  A statement that donations are made to the charitable fundraising platform, platform charity, recipient charitable organization, or person engaging in peer- to-peer charitable fundraising, whichever is applicable; (2)  A statement that a recipient charitable organization may not receive donations or grants or recommended donations, with an explanation identifying the most pertinent reasons that a recipient charitable organization may not receive the funds; provided that the explanation of the most pertinent reasons that a recipient charitable organization may not receive the funds may be provided through a conspicuous hyperlink, so long as the disclosure is conspicuous when the hyperlink is selected; provided further that this paragraph shall not apply when there are no circumstances under which a recipient charitable organization may not receive the funds; (3)  The maximum length of time it will take to send the donation or a grant of the recommended donation to a recipient charitable organization with an explanation of the time needed, unless the donation is sent contemporaneously to a recipient charitable organization after the donation is made; provided that the explanation as to the maximum length of time may be provided through a conspicuous hyperlink, so long as the disclosure is conspicuous when the hyperlink is selected; (4)  The fees or any other amounts that will be deducted from or added to the donation or a grant of the recommended donation and that are charged or retained by the charitable fundraising platform, platform charity, or any other partnering vendor, other than any applicable digital payment processing fees; and (5)  A statement as to the tax deductibility of the donation. (e) Each platform charity that solicits, permits, or otherwise enables solicitations shall obtain the written consent of a recipient charitable organization before using the recipient charitable organization's name in a solicitation for a purported charitable purpose.  Written consent shall be provided directly to the platform charity or may be provided to a platform charity by one authorized officer, director, trustee, or other duly authorized representative of the recipient charitable organization and may apply to multiple affiliated charitable fundraising platforms expressly identified in the agreement providing consent. (f)  After a donor contributes donations and with respect to purported charitable purposes, the platform charity shall promptly provide a tax donation receipt to the donor in a manner provided by section 170(f)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. (g) The platform charity shall not divert or otherwise misuse any donations made for purported charitable purposes that the platform charity receives through solicitation on the charitable fundraising platform and shall hold the donations in a separate account or accounts from other funds belonging to the platform charity.  The platform charity shall promptly ensure that donations and grants of recommended donations are sent to the recipient charitable organizations with an accounting of any fees assessed for processing the funds, and in accordance with any rules adopted by the department pursuant to chapter 91. (h)  If a platform charity enters into any contract with a vendor to solicit, receive, control, process, distribute, and otherwise account for donations on the charitable fundraising platform, the contract shall be available for inspection by the department. (i) As used in this section, "good standing" means that a platform charity, recipient charitable organization, or other charitable organization is not prohibited from soliciting or operating in the State by the department."

By amending the definition of "owner" to read: ""Owner" means any person who has a direct or indirect interest in any professional fundraising counsel[,] or professional solicitor[, charitable fundraising platform, or platform charity]." 3.

"Platform charity" does not include a sponsoring organization of donor advised funds that solicits donors to open donor advised fund accounts or similar accounts, receives recommendations from donors on charitable organizations that may receive grants of funds previously contributed to the sponsoring organization for a donor's donor advised fund account, and the sponsoring organization does not list or reference by name one or more recipient charitable organizations for solicitation purposes on its platform for persons who do not have advisory privileges with respect to the granting of funds in a donor advised fund of the sponsoring organization.  A person who meets the definitions of "platform charity" and "charitable fundraising platform" shall be deemed a charitable fundraising platform."

SB1048 HD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1048 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO SOLICITATION OF FUNDS FROM THE PUBLIC. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Act 205, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024 (Act 205), was intended to regulate charitable fundraising platforms to ensure proper and transparent fundraising activities in the State. The legislature further finds that Act 205's well-intended language creates undue burdens on charitable fundraising platforms and, more importantly, potentially hampers and inhibits the ability of charitable organizations to respond and fundraise, especially in times of emergency and need. The legislature additionally finds that it would be prudent to amend Act 205 before its scheduled effective date of January 1, 2026, in a manner that would still achieve the important purposes of public protection, donor security, and transparency, but not overburden charitable fundraising platforms, charitable organizations, and the department of the attorney general, who oversees these activities. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to amend the language in Act 205 to clarify existing standards and safeguards in online crowdfunding. SECTION 2.  Chapter 467B, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§467B-     Platform charities.  (a)  Every platform charity not exempted by section 467B-11.5 shall register with the department as a platform charity before conducting activities regulated by this chapter in accordance with section 467B-2.1.  A platform charity shall be subject to the annual financial report and annual filing fee requirements of section 467B-6.5.  Each report shall: (1)  Enable the department to ascertain whether charitable funds have been properly solicited, received, held, controlled, or distributed; (2)  Provide information on the number of donations made, amount raised, length of time for distributing donations or grants of recommended donations, fees charged by or through a charitable fundraising platform or platform charity, and names of recipient charitable organizations or other charitable organizations that were sent or have not yet been sent donations or grants of recommended donations; and (3)  Protect from disclosure any personally identifiable information of donors or other users of the charitable fundraising platform.
