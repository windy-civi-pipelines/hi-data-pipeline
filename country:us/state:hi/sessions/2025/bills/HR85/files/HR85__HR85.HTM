Section 1:
HR85 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.R. NO. 85 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII HOUSE RESOLUTION urging the State of Hawaii and City and County of Honolulu to collaborate in the development of a world-class, comprehensive sports complex in West Oahu. WHEREAS, sports play an important role in the health and wellbeing of individuals in Hawaii and around the world; and WHEREAS, at the national and international level, sports can be a unifier and a means for persons from different communities, states, and nations to come together and celebrate who they are, what they represent, and what they value; and WHEREAS, Hawaii's warm and relatively consistent climate allows for outdoor sports and training to be conducted all year, making the State an excellent choice for tournaments and sports training; and WHEREAS, Hawaii's location makes it an ideal place for sports teams from around the Asia-Pacific region to train and compete at a world‑class, comprehensive sports complex; and WHEREAS, West Oahu is one of the fastest-growing areas in the State and is a perfect community in which to construct a sports complex; and WHEREAS, the City and County of Honolulu and the State of Hawaii each control large parcels of land in West Oahu that could potentially accommodate a sports complex, including certain lands in the Kunia area adjacent to the H-1 Freeway and mass transit stations; and certain parcels adjacent to Coral Sea Road in Kapolei; and WHEREAS, the complex ideally should be two hundred to four hundred acres or more in area and should include facilities and equipment to accommodate a variety of indoor and outdoor sports, including a stadium having a capacity for at least sixty-five thousand spectators; at least four football or soccer fields with running tracks; at least four softball or baseball fields; and appropriately-sized sporting arenas with facilities for boxing, gymnastics, weight‑lifting, dancing, hula, swimming, and other sports and activities; and WHEREAS, the complex should also include any necessary ancillary facilities required to support the needs of the individuals and teams using the sports complex, including facilities for sports medicine, rehabilitation, education, weightlifting, and team accommodations, thereby allowing the complex to be a one-stop location to serve all of the complex users' needs; and WHEREAS, the complex should also host a Pacific Culture Center, in which Hawaii residents and visitors can share their cultures with each other through exhibits, classes, and performing arts; and WHEREAS, because the sports complex will be built to bring together people from across the Asia-Pacific region, it presents a unique opportunity to involve private and public entities from across the region to partner in the complex's development and providing most of the capital required for the complex's development; and WHEREAS, in addition to international partners, public and private entities from across the United States, including the federal government, may also wish to partner in this endeavor; and WHEREAS, these partnerships will allow construction of the sports complex with a smaller initial capital investment by the State and its political subdivisions, while also reducing risk to taxpayers in the long-run; and WHEREAS, once the complex opens to the public, revenue from visitors, including facility users and spectators, will generate moneys to cover operation and maintenance expenses; and WHEREAS, accordingly, this facility will have the potential to not only be financially self-sustaining but also to be a significant revenue generator for the State, City and County of Honolulu, and local businesses and residents; and WHEREAS, the sports complex will advance Hawaii's position as a true place of international exchange, taking advantage of the State's location at the crossroads of the Pacific, while also stimulating economic growth, increasing Kapolei's standing as Oahu's second city, and enhancing the quality of life for West Oahu residents; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, that the State of Hawaii and City and County of Honolulu are urged to collaborate in the development of a state‑of‑the‑art sports complex in West Oahu; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the sports complex be developed in partnership with public and private partners from across the United States and the Asia-Pacific region; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the complex provide opportunities for international athletes to compete and train in a variety of different sports while also including space for culture and arts exchange; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that Hawaii's congressional delegation work with the State and City and County of Honolulu to identify potential partners for this endeavor; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Office of the Governor and the Office of the Mayor of the City and County of Honolulu are requested to study the feasibility of the development of a comprehensive, world-class sports complex in West Oahu and submit a report of its findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, to the Legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2026; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the report identify locations in Kunia or Kapolei for the sports complex and any actions required to secure those locations for the complex, including land acquisitions, leases, and district boundary amendments; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Governor, Mayor of the City and County of Honolulu, and members of Hawaii's congressional delegation.
