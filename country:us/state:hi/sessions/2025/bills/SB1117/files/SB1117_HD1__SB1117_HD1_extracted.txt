SB1117 HD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1117 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO TRANSPORTATION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that under existing law, individuals under the age of fifteen are able to legally ride high-speed electric bicycles, which has led to numerous safety and other issues.  Under existing law, low-speed electric bicycles are defined as devices capable of speeds of up to twenty miles per hour, even though modern federal definitions allow for speeds of up to twenty-eight miles per hour, and the vast majority of electric bicycles on the market today are capable of reaching those speeds.  This means a five-year-old is legally able to ride a new electric bicycle and law enforcement can do little about it. The legislature further finds that due to increasingly expensive fossil fuels and a lack of cheaper transit options, Hawaii residents already pay among the highest costs in the country to commute.  A 2020 analysis studied all of the direct and indirect costs of car ownership and use in Hawaii and found that local taxpaying families pay about $24,400 per year to own and use a car, but could reduce that cost significantly by switching from three cars per family to two, or two cars to one, and by using an electric bicycle or similar mobility device for short trips. The legislature also finds that since its inception, the current electric bicycle and moped rebate program, even with minimal promotion and low subsidy amounts, has helped almost three hundred Hawaii families access electric bikes.  However, the program's reach and effectiveness have been limited by complicated restrictions and a lower rebate amount than other successful programs. In 2022, Denver's electric bike rebate program, which provided families with up to a $1,200 rebate, led to considerable cost savings for Denver families.  Participating families replaced many trips by car with trips by electric bicycle, which helped reduce vehicular traffic on crowded roads by over one hundred thousand vehicular miles weekly.  Ninety-six per cent of respondents said that the availability of the rebate made the difference when deciding to buy an electric bicycle. The legislature further finds that updates to the law regarding the use of helmets and operation of electric bicycles, mopeds, and electric motorcycles are necessary to enhance road safety for the entire community, and particularly for youths. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Prohibit a person from operating a moped or electric motorcycle in certain areas for bicycles; (2)  Rename the Electric Bicycle and Electric Moped Rebate Program to the Electric Mobility Device Rebate Program; (3)  Expand eligibility and amends the maximum rebate amounts; (4)  Reduce the deadline to submit an application to six months from the date of purchase; (5)  Authorize the Administrator of the rebate program to authorize grants under certain circumstances; (6)  Require applicants who are enrolled in a school, community, college, or university to demonstrate a financial need to be eligible for an additional assistance rebate; (7)  Exempt certain class 3 electric bicycles from registration requirements; (8)  Establish a cap for the Electric Mobility Device Subaccount and requirements for transferring funds into the Subaccount; (9)  Amend the age requirement for helmet use from sixteen to eighteen years of age; (10)  Prohibit a person under the age of fifteen from operating a class 3 electric bicycle; (11)  Establish rules for electric bicycle operation; (12)  Allow use of electric bicycles on public sidewalks, subject to certain conditions; (13)  Prohibit individuals under eighteen years of age from operating an electric motorcycle or motor-driven cycle; (14)  Changes the term "motor scooter" to "motor-driven vehicle"; and (15)  Appropriate funds. PART II SECTION 2.  Chapter 291C, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part XVI to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§291C-     Driving mopeds and electric motorcycles on bicycle lanes and paths; prohibited. No person shall operate a moped or electric motorcycle on a bicycle path, bicycle lane, or any other path or roadway designated for bicycle use." SECTION 3.  Section 196-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding four new definitions to be appropriately inserted and to read as follows: ""Adaptive electric bicycle" means any electric bicycle that is modified to fit the needs of an individual rider who is unable to use an electric bicycle. "Electric bicycle" means a bicycle equipped with fully operable pedals and an electric motor of no more than seven hundred fifty watts.  "Electric bicycle" does not include a high-speed electric device. "Electric micro-mobility device" means a device weighing no more than seventy-five pounds that is fully or partially motorized and used for personal transportation, such as one-wheels and electric skateboards.  "Electric micro-mobility device" does not include electric bicycles or electric foot scooters. "High-speed electric device" means a two-wheeled electric device with a motor exceeding seven hundred fifty watts and capable of speeds over twenty-eight miles per hour.  "High-speed electric device" does not include a moped or motorcycle that can legally be operated on a road or street." SECTION 4.  Section 196-7.8, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "[[]§196-7.8[]] Electric [bicycle and electric moped] mobility device rebate program; third-party administrator; special fund.  (a) The department of transportation shall administer a rebate program that incentivizes the purchase of new electric [bicycles and new electric mopeds] mobility devices and may contract with a third-party administrator pursuant to subsection [(i)] (j) to operate and manage the rebate program.
