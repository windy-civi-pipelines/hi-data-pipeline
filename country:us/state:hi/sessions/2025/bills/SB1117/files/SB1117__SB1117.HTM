Section 1:
SB1117 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1117 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO TRANSPORTATION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that under existing law, individuals under the age of fifteen are able to legally ride high-speed electric bicycles, which has led to numerous safety and other issues.  Under existing statute, electric bicycles are defined as devices capable of speeds of up to twenty miles per hour, even though modern federal definitions allow for speeds of up to twenty-eight miles per hour, and the vast majority of electric bicycles on the market today are capable of reaching those speeds.  This means a five-year-old is legally able to ride a new electric bicycle and law enforcement can do little about it. The legislature further finds that due to increasingly expensive fossil fuels and a lack of cheaper transit options, Hawaii residents already pay among the highest costs to commute in the country.  A 2020 analysis studied all of the direct and indirect costs of car ownership and use in Hawaii and found that local taxpaying families pay about $24,400 per year, but could reduce that cost significantly by switching from three cars per family to two, or two cars to one, and replacing short trips for those family members who are able with electric bicycles or similar mobility devices. The legislature also finds that the current electric bicycle and moped rebate program, even with minimal promotion and low subsidy, has helped almost three hundred Hawaii families access electric bikes since its inception.  However, its reach and effectiveness has been limited by complicated restrictions and a lower rebate than other successful programs. In 2022, Denver's electric bike rebate program, which provided families with up to a $1,200 rebate, led to considerable cost savings for Denver families, and replaced many trips by car with trips by electric bicycle which helped reduce vehicular traffic on crowded roads by over one hundred thousand vehicular miles weekly.  Ninety-six per cent of respondents said the availability of the rebate made the difference when deciding to buy an electric bike. The legislature further finds that updates to the law regarding the use of helmets and operation of electric bicycles are necessary to enhance road safety for the entire community, and particularly for youths. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Prohibit individuals under the age of fifteen from riding electric bicycles; (2)  Help reduce the cost of transportation and traffic on Hawaii's roads by addressing barriers in the existing electric bicycle and moped rebate program to enable the purchase and use of adaptive electric bicycles for those with disabilities and expand eligibility and rebates for electric bicycles to mirror similar proven successful programs more closely; (3)  Clarify the source of funding for the electric mobility rebate program; (4)  Allow for registration of class 3 electric bicycles with wheels smaller than twenty inches that are intended for adult use; (5)  Change the age for helmet requirements statewide from sixteen to eighteen years of age; (6)  Allow electric bicycles on public sidewalks, subject to certain conditions; (7)  Authorize rather than require that mopeds use bicycle lanes; (8)  Change the term "motor scooter" to "motor-driven vehicle"; and (9)  Require electric bicycle operators on public streets to follow certain safe riding behavior. SECTION 2.  Section 196-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding three new definitions to be appropriately inserted and to read as follows: ""Adaptive electric bicycle" means any bicycle that is modified to fit the needs of an individual rider who is unable to use a standard electric bicycle. "Electric bicycle" means a bicycle equipped with fully operable pedals, a saddle or seat for the rider, and an electric motor not to exceed seven hundred and fifty watts that meets the requirements of one of the following three classes: (1)  Class 1 electric bicycle, which is an electric bicycle equipped with a motor that provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling, and that ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches the speed of twenty miles per hour; (2)  Class 2 electric bicycle, which is an electric bicycle equipped with a motor that may be used exclusively to propel the bicycle, and that is not capable of providing assistance when the bicycle reaches the speed of twenty miles per hour; or (3)  Class 3 electric bicycle, which is an electric bicycle equipped with a motor that provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling, and that ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches the speed of twenty-eight miles per hour. "Electric micro-mobility device" means any ground transportation device, such as a standing scooter or similar device, that is powered either exclusively by electricity from a battery charged from an external source, or by electricity from a battery charged from an external source in addition to human power, which is designed to transport a single person, with a range not less than fifteen miles and maximum speed of twenty-eight miles per hour, on which a person may reasonably commute to and from regular destinations." SECTION 3.  Section 198-7.8, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "[[]§196-7.8[]] Electric [bicycle and electric moped] mobility rebate program; third-party administrator; special fund.  (a) The department of transportation shall administer a rebate program that incentivizes the purchase of new electric [bicycles and new electric mopeds] mobility devices and may contract with a third-party administrator pursuant to subsection [(i)] (k) to operate and manage the rebate program.

(c)  The department of transportation shall not issue more than [$700,000] $2,000,000 in total rebates under this section each fiscal year; provided that the electric [bicycle and electric moped] mobility subaccount within the highway development special fund pursuant to section 264-122(d) contains sufficient funds to pay the rebates.  The department of transportation shall not be liable to pay any refund if sufficient funds are unavailable.  The department of transportation shall allow valid claims filed by eligible applicants for whom sufficient funds may not be immediately available to receive a rebate as funds may be available in a subsequent year. (d)  The department of transportation shall: (1)  Prepare any forms that may be necessary for an applicant to claim a rebate pursuant to this section; and (2)  Require each applicant to furnish reasonable information to ascertain the validity of the claim, including but not limited to [the signature of the buyer and individual responsible for the sale on behalf of a retail store at the time of sale,] a copy of valid government issued photo identification of the buyer at the time of the sale, receipt of purchase, name and address of the retail store, verification of eligibility, and any other documentation necessary to demonstrate the legitimate purchase of a new electric [bicycle or new electric moped.] bicycle, adaptive electric bicycle, electric moped, or electric mobility device.
