Section 1:
HB1347 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1347 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT Relating to Fishing. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Act 207, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022, codified as section 188-23.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, prohibits the possession or use on, in, or near state marine waters, of any unmanned aerial vehicles, otherwise known as drones, for the purpose of taking aquatic life.  The legislature further finds that drone-assisted fishing, when used responsibly, can have certain benefits.  Thus, the legislature believes drone-assisted fishing should be regulated rather than prohibited. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to repeal section 188-23.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, and establish a framework for regulation and enforcement of responsible drone fishing practices. SECTION 2.  Chapter 188, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§188- Possession or use of unmanned aerial vehicles on, in, or near state marine waters; permitting; enforcement.  (a) The department of land and natural resources shall develop, implement, and administer a permitting system for the possession or use of unmanned aerial vehicles on, in, or near state marine waters for the purpose of taking aquatic life.  The permitting system shall include: (1)  Application procedures and requirements; (2)  Criteria for permit approval or denial; (3)  Conditions and restrictions on permit grantees; (4)  Permit fees; and (5)  Penalties for non-compliance. Permits shall be valid for one year from the date of issuance and may be renewed annually. (b)  The department of land and natural resources shall enforce this section and adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91.  In cases of noncompliance, the department may: (1)  Issue citations and fines, as determined by the department, to individuals using unmanned aerial vehicles for the purpose of taking aquatic life without a valid permit; and (2)  Seize for forfeiture any unmanned aerial vehicle used in violation of this section, pursuant to chapter 712A. (c)  The department shall charge applicants, at minimum, a: (1)  $100 annual fee per permit; (2)  $25 processing fee for first-time applicants; and (3)  $10 reissuance fee for lost or damaged permits. (d)  The department shall maintain records of all permits issued, violations reported, and enforcement actions conducted pursuant to this Act.  The department shall submit an annual report to the legislature no later than twenty days before the convening of each regular session summarizing its record of activities during the reporting year. (e)  As used in this section, "unmanned aerial vehicle" means any aerial vehicle that is operated without the possibility of direct human intervention within or on the aerial vehicle." SECTION 3.  Section 188-23.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is repealed. ["[§188-23.5]  Possession or use of unmanned aerial vehicles on, in, or near state marine waters prohibited; exception.  (a)  It is unlawful to possess or use on, in, or near state marine waters, any unmanned aerial vehicles, for the purpose of taking aquatic life, except under the terms and conditions of a permit first obtained by the user from the department of land and natural resources; provided that unmanned aerial vehicles may be used for the purpose of simple reconnaissance.  The department of land and natural resources may issue permits for the possession or use of unmanned aerial vehicles consistent with other legal requirements.
