HB966 HD2 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 966 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO AGRICULTURAL TOURISM. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that, throughout the nation, cattle ranches, agricultural farms, and other farming operations are diversifying their businesses by expanding into agricultural tourism activities.  These activities provide critical supplemental revenue streams and are increasingly becoming an essential part of the business models for many ranches and farms. The legislature further finds that the State's four counties each have their own agricultural tourism activity permitting processes, standards, procedures, and definitions.  This lack of consistency results in a disjointed regulatory framework, which impedes the growth of the State's agricultural sector, inhibits the development of viable farming and ranching business models, and systemically creates and aggravates impediments in zoning and permitting. The legislature acknowledges that, currently, agricultural tourism activities may be authorized through the special permitting process.  However, the use of this process pushes agricultural tourism activities to the periphery of farming operations and exacerbates the State's inconsistent permitting framework, further impeding growth in the agricultural sector and limiting the revenue potential of the agricultural businesses that the State is trying to nurture. Therefore, the legislature finds that there should be a uniform approach to approving agricultural tourism activities across the entire State.  With the enactment of targeted, meaningful legislation, agricultural tourism can become an area of growth and expansion for farmers while also creating opportunities for the types of regenerative tourism being encouraged by the Hawaii tourism authority.  The creation of a uniform framework will increase investment in agricultural tourism activities, promote unique partnerships between farmers and local businesses interested in agriculture, and increase support for affiliated farming pathway programs in the State. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish statewide, uniform standards to promote agricultural tourism activities in the State by: (1)  Creating agricultural tourism activity requirements that are applicable to all counties that have adopted an agricultural tourism ordinance; (2)  Requiring agricultural tourism activities to be registered by the county planning department; and (3)  Requiring agricultural tourism activities to coexist with an agricultural activity on a farming operation and providing for the termination of agricultural tourism activities upon the cessation of the agricultural activity, except under certain circumstances. PART II SECTION 2.  Chapter 205, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part I to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§205-     Agricultural tourism activities.  (a) Agricultural tourism activities may be conducted on a farming operation, as defined in section 165-2, for the enjoyment, education, or involvement of visitors. (b)  Agricultural tourism activities shall: (1)  Be accessory and secondary to the principal agricultural use; (2)  Coexist with an agricultural activity conducted on a farming operation; and (3)  Not interfere with surrounding farm operations. (c)  Agricultural tourism shall only be allowed on land on which productive agricultural use is occurring.  For the purposes of this subsection, "productive agricultural use" means the real property of the working farm, or farming operation as defined in section 165-2, is taxed as agricultural and is current on its real property tax obligations. (d)  Agricultural tourism activities shall be registered by the owner or lessee with the county planning department before commencement of any agricultural tourism activity; provided that the registration shall include the following information: (1)  A description of access to the farm, including road width, road surface, and parking; (2)  A description of accessory facilities connected with the farming operation, such as gift shops and restaurants; (3)  Activities for visitors that may be offered by the farming operation; (4)  Documentation that a productive agricultural use is occurring on the farm pursuant to subsection (c); (5)  Federal and state tax returns verifying farm income of the principal farming operation; (6)  Verification of enrollment in a county agricultural use dedication program; and (7)  Verification of county agricultural water rates if enrolled. (e)  The authorization to conduct agricultural tourism activities at the farming operation shall be automatically terminated upon the cessation of the agricultural activity conducted on the farming operation, unless the cessation of the agricultural activity is temporary and due to inclement weather, disease or pest infestation, market and supply chain disruptions, or change in crop type." SECTION 3.  Section 205-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (d) to read as follows: "(d)  Agricultural districts shall include: (1)  Activities or uses as characterized by the cultivation of crops, crops for bioenergy, orchards, forage, and forestry;

SECTION 4.  Section 205-4.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows: "(a)  Within the agricultural district, all lands with soil classified by the land study bureau's detailed land classification as overall (master) productivity rating class A or B and for solar energy facilities, class B or C, shall be restricted to the following permitted uses: (1)  Cultivation of crops, including crops for bioenergy, flowers, vegetables, foliage, fruits, forage, and timber;
