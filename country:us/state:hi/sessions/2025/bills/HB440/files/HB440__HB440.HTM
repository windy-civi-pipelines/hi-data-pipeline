Section 1:
HB440 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 440 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING to immigration. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that according to a report published by the American Immigration Council in 2020, Hawaii is home to 266,147 immigrants, including forty-five thousand undocumented immigrants.  The legislature further finds that Hawaii is justifiably proud of its rich immigrant heritage, which has woven many people into a valued tapestry of races, ancestral groups, religions, cultures, and languages from many parts of the world. The legislature further finds that approximately seven per cent of Hawaii public school students have at least one parent who is an undocumented immigrant.  Education is critically important to the proper acculturation and adaptation to living in Hawaii and the United States.  Schools should be a safe and secure location for students to learn and grow. The legislature also finds that the Hawaii health systems corporation is the safety net for acute care on the neighbor islands and long-term care throughout the State.  As a safety net system of hospitals and providers, the Hawaii health systems corporation provides services regardless of whether an individual has health insurance or the ability to pay.  The Hawaii health systems corporation operates eight hundred and forty-seven licensed beds in facilities located on four different islands and is affiliated with three nonprofits on Oahu, Maui, and Hawaii island and plays a critical role in supporting the health care needs of the State's immigrant population. The legislature additionally finds that while immigration is a federal function, state and local agencies have significant discretion regarding whether and how to respond to requests for assistance from federal immigration enforcement.  The enforcement of immigration law is carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, both of which are agencies of the United States Department of Homeland Security.  Federal law does not require state and local entities to collect or share information with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.  Rather, federal law, under title 8 United States Code section 1373, limits state and local governments from restricting communication with federal immigration authorities concerning "information regarding the immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual".  There is no affirmative duty for state and local governments to collect or share this information, and there is no prohibition against preventing the communication of other non-public information. The legislature further finds that because Hawaii is home to people of diverse ethnic, racial, and national backgrounds, including immigrants who are valuable and important members of our community, and because of Hawaii's strong due process and civil rights protections for all, it is essential to ensure that immigrants and migrants are provided due process and civil rights protections in the State's public schools and while receiving care in the State's safety net health care facilities. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to prohibit certain covered educational entities and Hawaii health systems corporation facilities from collecting information regarding citizenship or immigration status or allowing officers of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to enter certain facilities except under specific circumstances. SECTION 2.  The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Chapter Due Process Immigration status protections in certain educational and health facilities §   -1  Definitions.  As used in this chapter: "Affiliated facility" means an affiliate of the Hawaii health systems corporation. "Charter school" has the same meaning as in section 302D-1.
