A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO TAX LIENS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that Act 166, Session
2 Laws of Hawaii 2009, enacted a fifteen-year statute of
3 limitations on certain collection actions of tax assessments,
4 comparable to the ten-year statute of limitations that applies
5 to federal taxes.
6 The purpose of this Act is to adopt procedures comparable
7 to those in the federal system to ensure that taxpayers are not
8 harmed by previously recorded tax liens for which the underlying
9 liability has been satisfied or been rendered unenforceable by
10 the expiration of the fifteen-year period.
11 SECTION 2. Section 231-33, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
12 amended by amending subsections (f) and (g) to read as follows:
13 "(f) The department may record in the bureau of
14 conveyances at Honolulu, or in respect of a lien on a motor
15 vehicle, file with the county director of finance, a certificate
16 setting forth the amount of taxes due and unpaid, which have
17 been returned, assessed, or as to which a notice of proposed

1 assessment has issued. The certificate shall identify the
2 taxpayer, the taxpayer’s last known address, [-and] the tax or
3 taxes involved[—], and the date on which the liability for the
4 tax or taxes was assessed. The recording or filing of the
5 certificate has the effect set forth in this section, but
6 nothing in this section shall be deemed to require that a
7 certificate recorded or filed by the department must include the
8 amount of any penalty or interest, in order to protect the lien
9 therefor. The certificate, if recorded or filed with the county
10 director of finance, shall be entered of record as provided by
11 law. Recordation of the certificate in the bureau of
12 conveyances shall be deemed, at such time, for all purposes and
13 without any further action, to procure a lien on land registered
14 in the land court under chapter 501. Any cost incurred in the
15 filing of the certificate shall be a part of the lien for the
16 tax therein set forth.
17 (g) The department may issue a certificate of discharge of
18 any part of the property subject to the lien imposed by this
19 section, upon.payment in partial satisfaction of such lien, of
20 an amount not less than the value as determined by the
21 department of the lien on the part to be so discharged, or if
