HB1231 SD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1231 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII S.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO TRAFFIC SAFETY. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii has among the highest rates of traffic related fatalities. The implementation of photo red light imaging detector systems at intersections with the most dangerous and highest risk transit infrastructure, as well as photo speed detector systems in school zones with the most dangerous and high-risk transit infrastructure, can help prevent drivers from running red lights, and slow speeders in key areas, to help reduce fatalities and injuries. The legislature further finds that it should be a priority to ensure dedicated funding necessary to support accelerating improvements in the most dangerous transit corridors serving state schools, to reduce student deaths and injuries, which may not otherwise be a priority for federal funding or other agencies. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Prohibit the use of facial recognition software in the operation of any photo red light imaging detector system; (2)  Authorize the state highway safety and modernization council to recommend dangerous intersections; (3)  Authorize the safe routes to schools advisory committee to recommend dangerous school zones; (4)  Increase vehicle weight taxes for the safe routes to school program special fund; (5)  Clarify the summons and citations processes for the automated speed enforcement systems program; and (6)  Appropriate funds. SECTION 2.  Chapter 291J, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§291J-    Facial recognition software; prohibited.  (a)  The State or any county shall not use any facial recognition software with any photo red light imaging detector system,  automated speed enforcement system, or other camera monitoring an outdoor public space, operated pursuant to this chapter. (b)  For the purposes of this section, "facial recognition software" means any type of technology that identifies or verifies the identity of an individual captured in images or video." SECTION 3.  Section 249-33, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows: "§249-33 State vehicle weight tax, exemptions.  (a) All vehicles and motor vehicles in the State as defined in section 249-1, including antique motor vehicles, except as otherwise provided in sections 249-4, 249-5.5, 249-6, and 249-6.5, in addition to all other fees and taxes levied by this chapter, shall be subject to an annual state vehicle weight tax.  The tax shall be levied by the county director of finance at the rate of 1.75 cents a pound according to the net weight of each vehicle as the "net weight" is defined in section 249-1 up to and including four thousand pounds net weight; vehicles over four thousand pounds and up to and including seven thousand pounds net weight shall be taxed at the rate of [2.00] 3.00 cents a pound; vehicles over seven thousand pounds and up to and including ten thousand pounds net weight shall be taxed at the rate of [2.25] 3.75 cents a pound; vehicles over ten thousand pounds net weight shall be taxed at a flat rate of $300.; provided that for each vehicle taxed: (1)  One cent a pound for vehicles over four thousand pounds and up to and including seven thousand pounds net weight; and (2)  1.5 cents a pound for vehicles over seven thousand pounds net weight, shall be deposited into the safe routes to school program special fund." SECTION 4.  Section 291C-4, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§291C-4  Safe routes to school program special fund; establishment.  There is established in the state treasury the safe routes to school program special fund, into which shall be deposited: (1)  Assessments collected for speeding in a school zone, pursuant to section 291C-104; [and] (2)  Safe routes to school program surcharges collected in accordance with sections 291-16 and 291C-5[.]; and (3)  Taxes collected pursuant to section 249-33." SECTION 5.  Section 291L-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "[[]§291L-2[]]  Automated speed enforcement systems program; established.  (a)  There shall be established the automated speed enforcement systems program, which shall be implemented by the State to enforce the speed restriction laws of the State.  The automated speed enforcement [system] systems program shall be limited to only those locations where a photo red light imaging detector system has been implemented pursuant to chapter 291J. (b)  Automated speed enforcement systems may be implemented along a road or highway by the State or counties within two hundred feet of a school zone identified by the safe routes to school advisory committee for the promotion of public health, safety, and welfare." SECTION 6.  Section 291L-5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "[[]§291L-5[]]  Summons or citation.  (a) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary and except as otherwise provided in this chapter, beginning January 1, 2025, whenever any motor vehicle is determined, by means of an automated speed enforcement system, to have exceeded the posted maximum speed limit by not less than [five] miles per hour in violation of section 291C-108, the State's or county's third-party contractor shall cause a summons or citation, as described in this section, to be sent by first-class mail[, that is postmarked within ten calendar days after the date of the incident,] to the registered owner of the motor vehicle [at the].
