C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO EVICTION MEDIATION.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that many Hawaii
2 residents continue to face challenges paying their rent. This
3 is a problem for both housing providers and tenants because
4 tenants risk losing their homes due to nonpayment, and housing
5 providers risk losing their property or not keeping up with
6 their bills because of the nonpayment.
7 Act 57, Session Laws of Hawaii 2021 (Act 57), encouraged
8 communication and facilitated mediation between housing
9 providers and tenants to help encourage collaborative solutions
10 to this common problem and to avoid evictions when possible.
11 Experience shows that the mediation procedures created by Act 57
12 were widely successful in substantially increasing the number of
13 disputes that were settled in mediation without any eviction
14 cases being filed and increased the number of settlements in
15 which the parties agreed that the tenant could continue to
16 reside in the dwelling unit. However, the amendments to the
17 Residential Landlord-Tenant Code by Act 57 have expired.
