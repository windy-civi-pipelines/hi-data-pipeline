THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO DATA SHARING.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that Hawaii is facing an
2 affordability crisis, which is pushing more young adults and
3 families to relocate out of State. The United States Census
4 data shows that from 2020 to 2022, the State experienced an
5 average net loss of 8,429 residents per year due to
6 out-migration, continuing a trend of population decline. As the
7 State with the highest cost of living in the nation and a
8 limited housing market, residents often struggle to get by, even
9 when they are employed. Forty-two per cent of residents are
10 unable to afford basic necessities and secure jobs that pay a
11 sustainable wage, and fifty-seven per cent of Hawaii's college
12 graduates are underemployed five years after graduation.
13 The legislature further finds that state leaders have
14 identified better access, analysis, and sharing of data as a key
15 strategy to effectively address the affordability crisis.
16 California, Colorado, and Washington have reformed their data
17 systems to increase cross-agency collaboration and governance,

1 bringing coherence to a complex web of different and siloed data
2 systems, saving money, and bringing stronger visibility and
3 collaboration around their needs. In these and other states, a
4 centralized agency coordinates efforts to translate data between
5 state departments and convenes partners and stakeholders to
6 promote transparency and collaborative decision making.
7 The legislature additionally finds that the State has many
8 foundational elements for the effective use of data, including a
9 chief data officer and the Hawaii Data exchange Partnership.
10 However, while some departments are required to share data,
11 existing law does not identify a centralized coordinating agency
12 or office for this work, nor does it include guidelines around
13 operations and reporting found in exemplar state models. This
14 limits the analyses available to decision makers that could be
15 improved through streamlined data sharing. For example, the
16 Hawaii Data exchange Partnership is currently unable to identify
17 Hawaii public school graduates in Hawaii's workforce if they
18 attended college out of state or at a private college, joined
19 the military, or directly entered the workforce. This means
20 that the State is unable to account for a significant number of
21 young adults as they enter a critical point of their lives. For

1 policymakers, this knowledge gap highlights the difficulty in
2 assessing whether investments in career pathways at the K-12
3 level are enabling graduates to attain a living wage in the
4 State. With a centralized agency to help match graduate records
5 between the department of education and the department of labor
6 and industrial relations, these information gaps could be
7 directly addressed.
8 The legislature also finds that establishing a data sharing
9 and governance working group within the office of enterprise
10 technology services is an important step for ensuring more
11 effective, efficient, and impactful collaboration among state
12 agencies and stakeholders.
13 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish a data
14 sharing and governance working group within the office of
15 enterprise technology services to be chaired by the chief
16 information officer.
17 SECTION 2. (a) There is established within the office of
18 enterprise technology services a data sharing and governance
19 working group.
20 (b) The data sharing and governance working group shall:

8 address gaps in data collection, including high

11 (B) Existing barriers to seamless and frequent
12 cross-departmental data sharing;
