2 not constitute a violation of this chapter. The
3 opinion rendered or deemed rendered, until amended or
4 revoked, shall be binding on the commission in any
5 subsequent charges concerning the person subject to
6 this chapter who sought the opinion and acted in
7 reliance on it in good faith, unless material facts
8 were omitted or misstated by the person in the request
9 for an advisory opinion. The commission shall also

3 (b) Charges concerning the violation of this chapter shall
4 be in writing, signed by the person making the charge under
5 oath; provided that any charge initiated by the commission shall
6 be signed by three or more members of the commission. The
7 commission shall issue written notice to every person against
8 whom a charge is received and afford the person an opportunity
9 to explain the conduct alleged to be in violation of the
10 chapter. The commission may investigate, after compliance with
11 this section, the charges and render an informal advisory
12 opinion to the alleged violator. The commission shall
13 investigate all charges on a confidential basis, having
14 available all the powers herein provided, and proceedings at
15 this stage shall not be public. If the informal advisory
16 opinion indicates a probable violation, the person charged shall
17 request a formal opinion or within a reasonable time comply with
18 the informal advisory opinion. If the person charged fails to
19 comply with the informal advisory opinion or if a majority of
20 the members of the commission determine that there is probable

6 addressee only. If after due diligence service cannot be
7 effected successfully in accordance with the above, service may
8 be made by publication if so ordered by the circuit court of the
9 circuit wherein the alleged violator last resided. The
10 commission shall submit to the circuit court for its
11 consideration in issuing its order to allow service by
12 publication an affidavit setting forth facts based upon the
13 personal knowledge of the affiant concerning the methods, means,
14 and attempts made to locate and effect service by personal
15 service or by registered or certified mail in accordance with
16 the above. Service by publication when ordered by the court
17 shall be made by publication once a week for four successive
18 weeks of a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the
19 circuit of the alleged violator's last known state address. The
20 alleged violator shall have twenty days after service thereof to
21 respond in writing to the charge and statement.

1 (c) If after twenty days following service of the charge
2 and further statement of alleged violation in accordance with
3 this section, a majority of the members of the commission
4 conclude that there is probable cause to believe that a
5 violation of this chapter has been committed, then the
6 commission shall set a time and place for a hearing, giving
7 notice to the complainant and the alleged violator in the same
8 manner as provided in subsection (b). Upon the commission's
9 issuance of a notice of hearing, the charge and further
10 statement of alleged violation and the alleged violator's
11 written response thereto shall become public records. The
12 hearing shall be held within ninety days of the commission's
13 issuance of a notice of hearing. If the hearing is not held
14 within that ninety-day period, the charge and further statement
15 of alleged violation shall be dismissed; provided that any delay
16 that is at the request of, or caused by, the alleged violator
17 shall not be counted against the ninety-day period.
18 All parties shall have an opportunity to:
19 (1) Be heard;
20 (2) Subpoena witnesses and require the production of any
21 books or papers relative to the proceedings;
SB LRB 25-0392.docx 1

1 (3) Be represented by counsel; and
2 (4) Have the right of cross-examination.
3 All hearings shall be in accordance with chapter 91. All
4 witnesses shall testify under oath and the hearings shall be
5 open to the public. The commission shall not be bound by the
6 strict rules of evidence but the commission's findings shall be
7 based on competent and substantial evidence.
8 All testimony and other evidence taken at the hearing shall
9 be recorded. All fees collected under this chapter shall be
10 deposited into the general fund.
11 (d) A decision of the commission pertaining to the conduct
12 of any person subject to this chapter shall be in writing and
13 signed by three or more of the members of the commission. A
14 decision of the commission rendered after a hearing together
15 with findings and the record of the proceeding shall be a public
16 record.
17 (e) A person who files a frivolous charge with the
18 commission against any person covered by this chapter shall be
19 civilly liable to the person charged for all costs incurred in
20 defending the charge, including but not limited to costs and
21 attorneys' fees. In any case where the commission does not

■HIIBIillilllill

Page 21
S.B. NO.
1 issue a decision or final conclusion in which the commission
2 concludes that a person has violated this chapter, the
3 commission shall, upon the written request of the person
4 charged, make a finding as to whether or not the charge was
5 frivolous. The person charged may initiate an action in the
6 circuit court for recovery of fees and costs incurred in
7 commission proceedings within one year after the commission
8 renders a decision that the charge was frivolous. The
9 commission's decision shall be binding upon the court for
10 purposes of a finding pursuant to section 607-14.5.
11 (f) The commission shall cause to be published yearly
12 summaries of decisions, advisory opinions, and informal advisory
13 opinions. The commission shall make sufficient deletions in the
14 summaries to prevent disclosing the identity of persons involved
15 in the decisions or opinions where the identity of such persons
16 is not otherwise a matter of public record under this chapter.
17 (g) Notwithstanding the above procedures, for any
18 violation of this chapter with a proposed administrative penalty
19 of less than $1,000, the state ethics commission may issue a
20 notice and order of administrative fine describing the violation
21 and assessing an administrative fine. The order shall become
SB LRB 25-0392.docx 21

Page 22 S.B. NO. 2.^*1
1 final on the twentieth day after it is served upon the alleged
2 violator, unless the alleged violator submits a written request
3 for a hearing before the state ethics comm.ission on or before
4 the twentieth day. After conducting a hearing pursuant to
5 chapter 91, the state ethics commission may affirm, modify, or
6 rescind the order as appropriate. The state ethics commission
7 may file with the circuit court of the first circuit any order
8 the commission has issued pursuant to this section for the
9 purpose of confirming the order as a final judgment that shall
10 have the same force and effect and shall be enforceable and
11 collectable as other judgments issued by the circuit courts;
12 provided that there shall be no appeal from the judgment.”
13 SECTION 6. Section 97-7, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
14 amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows:
15 "(b) No fine shall be assessed unless the state ethics
16 commission:
17 (1) Convenes a hearing in accordance with section 97-6 (c)
18 and chapter 91 and renders a decision; [e±^]
19 (2) Together with the alleged violator, agrees to resolve
20 any alleged violation before the completion of the
21 contested case process; provided that the resolution
SB LRB 25-0392.docx 22

S.B. NO.
1 includes payment of an administrative fine or
2 restitution, or both[—]; or
3 (3) Issues a notice and order of administrative fine
4 pursuant to section 97-6 (g)."
5 SECTION 7. This Act does not affect rights and duties that
6 matured, penalties that were incurred, and proceedings that were
7 begun before its effective date.
8 SECTION 8. If any provision of this Act, or the
9 application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held
10 invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or
11 applications of the Act that can be given effect without the
12 invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions
13 of this Act are severable.
14 SECTION 9. Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed
15 and stricken. New statutory material is underscored.
16 SECTION 10. This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
