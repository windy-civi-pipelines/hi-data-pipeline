STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO MOTOR CARRIERS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the State's beach
2 parks, scenic viewpoints, hiking trailheads, cultural sites,
3 wildlife habitats, and other natural resources are popular
4 destinations for visitors to the State. However, these sites
5 are often located alongside congested state highways or county
6 roads with limited parking.
7 The legislature further finds that there are
8 community-based organizations that collaborate with the State,
9 counties, visitor industry, and impacted neighborhoods to
10 address traffic congestion in these areas, such as the shuttle
11 system currently in use in Haena, Kauai, which reduces the
12 number of vehicles on the narrow Kuhio highway. This shuttle
13 system generates revenues to fund shuttle operations, as well as
14 improvements at the Haena state park, parking attendant
15 salaries, and the costs of maintaining and expanding loi and
16 cultural sites within Haena state park.
