Section 1:
SB764 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 764 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to physician sHORTAGE. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the State's physician shortage is partially driven by the structure and cost of its medical licensing process.  The State's licensing fees are among the highest in the United States with costs exceeding $1,000 for initial licensure and ongoing renewal fees that burden many physicians, especially newer physicians with significant student loan debt. The legislature further finds that out-of-state physicians face additional economic obstacles in obtaining a physician license when relocating to the State, often involving extra steps not required in states with reciprocal agreements. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to address barriers within the State's medical licensing process for physicians by establishing a one-year pilot program to provide subsidized licensing fees for new and out-of-state physicians applying for initial licensure in the State. SECTION 2. (a)  There is established a physician licensing subsidy pilot program within the professional and vocational licensing division of the department of commerce and consumer affairs to provide subsidized licensing fees for new and out‑of‑state physicians applying for initial licensure in the State. (b) The pilot program shall establish a subsidized licensing fee structure for physicians applying for initial licensure in the State.  To be eligible for the pilot program, applicants shall be a person who has passed and has been found to possess the necessary qualifications pursuant to section 453‑4, Hawaii Revised Statutes, or out-of-state physician applying for physician licensure in the State for the first time. (c) The subsidized licensing fee structure established for the purposes of the pilot program shall reduce the total licensing fees for eligible applicants applying for a doctor of medicine license in the State to an amount not to exceed one‑half of the total licensing fees assessed for applicants without the subsidy. (d)  The department of commerce and consumer affairs shall collaborate with the department of health, university of Hawaii John A. Burns school of medicine, and other physician recruitment stakeholders to promote the pilot program. (e) The department of commerce and consumer affairs shall adopt rules without regard to chapter 91, Hawaii Revised Statutes, necessary for the purposes of this pilot program. (f) The department of commerce and consumer affairs shall submit a report of its findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, regarding the pilot program to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 2026. The report shall include at minimum, the number of individuals who applied for the subsidized licensing fee, number of applicants granted the subsidized licensing fee; and number of applicants who were granted the subsidized licensing fee that obtained a doctor of medicine license in the State. (g) The pilot program shall cease to exist on June 30, 2026. SECTION 3. There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 for the establishment and administration of the physician licensing subsidy pilot program.
