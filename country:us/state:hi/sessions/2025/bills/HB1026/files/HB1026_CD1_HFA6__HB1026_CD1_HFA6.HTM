HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AMENDMENT TO: H.B.

Therefore, the general fund expenditure ceiling for fiscal year 2024-2025 has already been exceeded by $38,885,954 or 1 per cent. The appropriations contained in this Act will cause the general fund expenditure ceiling for fiscal year 2024-2025 to be further exceeded by $105,698,787, or 2 per cent.  This declaration takes into account the additional general fund appropriations authorized for fiscal year 2024-2025 in this Act only.  The reasons for exceeding the general fund expenditure ceiling are that the appropriations made in this Act are necessary to serve the public interest and to meet the needs addressed by this Act."
