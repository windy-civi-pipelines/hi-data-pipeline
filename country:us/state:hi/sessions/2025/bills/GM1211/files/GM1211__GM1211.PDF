THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE. 2025
STATE OF HAWAII C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO PARKING.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the statewide
2 parking program for persons with disabilities, was established
3 to provide individuals with mobility disabilities the ability to
4 travel and park in accessible parking spaces via the use of
5 parking placards. However, improper use and insufficient
6 enforcement impact access for legitimate program participants.
7 The legislature further finds that adoption of electric
8 vehicles is a vital step in the State's efforts to combat
9 climate change, reach the 2045 mandated carbon neutrality, and
10 create a more sustainable future. The legislature has made
11 efforts to encourage and facilitate the adoption of electric
12 vehicles with tax credits and with designated charging parking
13 spaces. These parking spaces not only encourage the adoption of
14 electric vehicles but are a vital component to personal and
15 statewide use. The ability to park in an electric vehicle space
16 allows individuals to make sure they can continue to use their

1 vehicle with ease and have the security to make it to their next
2 destination with adequate fuel.
3 The legislature concludes that the use of these spaces by
4 non-electric vehicles not only takes away an incentive granted
5 to electric vehicle drivers but can imperil their transportation
6 use by not allowing them the opportunity to recharge.
7 Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to authorize the
8 counties to adopt ordinances to enforce the accessible parking
9 space design requirements for parking for disabled persons and
10 parking for electric vehicles and any respective administrative
11 rules to ensure unimpeded access for program participants.
12 SECTION 2. Chapter 291, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
13 amended by adding a new section to part III to be appropriately
14 designated and to read as follows:
15 "§291- Requirement to provide parking for persons with
16 disabilities; ordinances to enforce. (a) Each county may adopt
17 ordinances to:
18 (1) Enforce the design and construction requirements of
19 this part, and any administrative rules adopted
20 pursuant to this part, pertaining to the provision of
21 parking spaces and access to parking spaces reserved

1 for persons with disabilities, including but not
2 limited to the number, location, design, and signage
3 of these parking spaces; and
4 (2) Establish penalties for failure to comply with
5 ordinances adopted pursuant to this section.
6 (b) An official appointed by a county may enter the
7 property of a place of public accommodation to enforce any
8 applicable ordinances adopted pursuant to this section.
9 (c) For the purposes of this section, "place of public
10 accommodation" has the same meaning as in section 489-2."
11 SECTION 3. Section 291-73, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
12 amended to read as follows:
13 "[-£•] §291-73 (•}•] Ordinances to enforce authorized. (a)
14 Each county may adopt ordinances to enforce the requirements of
15 section 291-71, including the establishment of penalties for
16 failure to comply with the requirements of that section or
17 maintain electric vehicle charging systems in working order.
18 (b) Any official appointed by a county may enter the
19 property of a place of public accommodation to enforce any
20 applicable ordinances adopted pursuant to this section.
