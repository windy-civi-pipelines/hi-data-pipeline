BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the new aloha stadium entertainment district is a critical project for the State.  The project promises significant benefits to the community and serves as an exemplar for large-scale public‑private partnerships within the State.
