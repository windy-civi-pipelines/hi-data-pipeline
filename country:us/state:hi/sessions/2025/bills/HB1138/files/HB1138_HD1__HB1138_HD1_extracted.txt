HB1138 HD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1138 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO OCEAN USER SAFETY. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that one of the responsibilities of the department of land and natural resources, division of boating and ocean recreation is to oversee ocean recreation management in ocean waters of the State.

The purpose of this Act is to authorize the board of land and natural resources to adopt, amend, or repeal emergency rules relating to commercial and recreational use of water sports equipment that may be in effect for a period of up to three hundred sixty-five days. SECTION 2.  Section 91-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows: "(b) Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (a), if an agency finds that an imminent peril to the public health, safety, or morals, including ocean user safety; to livestock and poultry health[,]; or to natural resources requires adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule upon less than thirty days' notice of hearing, and states in writing its reasons for such finding, it may proceed without prior notice or hearing or upon such abbreviated notice and hearing, including posting the abbreviated notice and hearing on the Internet as provided in section 91-2.6, as it finds practicable to adopt an emergency rule to be effective for a period of not longer than one hundred twenty days without renewal[.]; provided that the board of land and natural resources may adopt, amend, or repeal an emergency rule under this subsection to be effective for a period no longer than three hundred sixty-five days without renewal for the regulation of commercial and recreational use of water sports equipment to promote ocean user safety. For the purposes of this subsection, "water sports equipment" means any equipment, contrivance, frame, or other device that one or more persons may wear, or lie, sit, or stand upon or in, that is primarily for use in or on the water for pleasure, recreation, or sports, and that shall not be used primarily for transportation."
