HB629 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 629 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to therapy services. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that amending Hawaii's occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech pathology laws is necessary to promote a more cost effective model for delivering therapeutic services to students in the department of education.  Currently, the department of education is unable to claim reimbursement unless licensed occupational therapists, physical therapists, and speech pathologists employed by or contracted with the department of education obtain a prescription from a physician or other authorized health care provider before providing services to students.  This requirement creates barriers that hinder the department of education's ability to be reimbursed for the services provided. The legislature further finds that timely access to occupational, physical, and speech therapy services is critical for supporting students' development, particularly in physical, sensory, cognitive, and communication skills.  These services enable students to participate more fully in educational and social activities and to benefit more effectively from their learning environments. Moreover, the legislature also finds that expanding the scopes of practice for licensed occupational therapists, physical therapists, and speech pathologists may facilitate the department of education's ability to obtain reimbursement. By allowing occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech therapy services to be provided after a diagnosis of a medical condition by these providers without a physician's diagnosis, the department of education can more effectively bill for these services, generating additional funding to support and enhance therapeutic resources for students. The purpose of this Act is to expand the scopes of practice for occupational therapists, physical therapists, and speech pathologists employed by or contracted with the department of education to diagnose students with a medical condition and treat them, thereby streamlining service delivery. SECTION 2.  Section 457G-1.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§457G-1.5  Practice of occupational therapy.  (a)  The practice of occupational therapy is the therapeutic use of everyday life activities with individuals or groups for the purpose of participation in roles and situations in home, school, workplace, community, and other settings.  It includes: (1)  Evaluation of factors affecting activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, rest and sleep, education, work, play, leisure, and social participation, including: (A)  Client factors, including body functions, such as neuromusculoskeletal, sensory-perceptual, visual, mental, cognitive, and pain factors; body structures, such as cardiovascular, digestive, nervous, integumentary, genitourinary systems, and structures related to movement, values, beliefs, and spirituality; (B)  Habits, routines, roles, rituals, and behavior patterns; (C)  Occupational and social environments, cultural, personal, temporal, and virtual contexts and activity demands that affect performance; and (D)  Performance skills, including motor and praxis, sensory-perceptual, emotional regulation, cognitive, communication, and social skills; (2)  Methods or approaches selected to direct the process of interventions, including: (A)  Establishment, remediation, or restoration of a skill or ability that has not yet developed, is impaired, or is in decline; (B)  Compensation, modification, or adaptation of activity or environment to enhance performance or prevent injuries, disorders, or other conditions; (C)  Retention and enhancement of skills or abilities without which performance in everyday life activities would decline; (D)  Promotion of health and wellness, including the use of self-management strategies, to enable or enhance performance in everyday life activities; and (E)  Prevention of barriers to performance and participation, including injury and disability prevention; and (3)  Interventions and procedures to promote or enhance safety and performance in activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, rest and sleep, education, work, play, leisure, and social participation, including: (A)  Therapeutic use of occupations, exercises, and activities; (B)  Training in self-care, self-management, health management and maintenance, home management, community reintegration, work reintegration, school activities, and work performance; (C)  Development, remediation, or compensation of neuromusculoskeletal, sensory-perceptual, visual, mental, and cognitive functions; pain tolerance and management; and behavioral skills; (D)  Therapeutic use of self, including one's personality, insights, perceptions, and judgments, as part of the therapeutic process; (E)  Education and training of individuals, including family members, caregivers, groups, populations, and others; (F)  Care coordination, case management, and transition services; (G)  Consultative services to groups, programs, organizations, or communities; (H)  Modification of environments, such as home, work, school, or community, and adaptation of processes, including the application of ergonomic principles; (I)  Assessment, design, fabrication, application, fitting, and training in seating and positioning; assistive technology; adaptive devices; orthotic devices; and training in the use of prosthetic devices; (J)  Assessment, recommendation, and training in techniques to enhance functional mobility, including management of wheelchairs and other mobility devices; (K)  Low vision rehabilitation; (L)  Driver rehabilitation and community mobility; (M)  Management of feeding, eating, and swallowing to enable eating and feeding performance; (N)  Application of physical agent modalities and use of a range of specific therapeutic procedures, such as wound care management, interventions to enhance sensory-perceptual and cognitive processing, and manual therapy, to enhance performance skills; and (O)  Facilitating the occupational performance of groups, populations, or organizations through the modification of environments and the adaptation of processes.

For the purposes of this subsection, "occupational therapy services" means the therapeutic use of everyday life activities with students for the purpose of participation in roles and situations in school, home, and community settings.  "Occupational therapy services" include but are not limited to: (1)  Evaluating students' needs and developing individualized treatment plans; (2)  Providing interventions to improve students' fine motor skills, gross motor skills, sensory processing, visual-motor integration, and cognitive skills; (3)  Adapting classroom environments and materials to facilitate students' participation in school activities; (4)  Training teachers and parents on strategies to support students' occupational needs; (5)  Recommending assistive technology devices and adaptive equipment; and (6)  Diagnosing medical conditions that can be treated by occupational therapy."
