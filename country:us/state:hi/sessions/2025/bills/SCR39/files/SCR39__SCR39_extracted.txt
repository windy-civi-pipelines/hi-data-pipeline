Section 1:
SCR39 THE SENATE S.C.R. NO. 39 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION urging the maui county planning department to RETAIN the word "require" in the south maui community plan as it relates to infrastructure TO ENSURE THAT DEVELOPMENT DOES NOT OCCUR WITHOUT ADEQUATE SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE. WHEREAS, the South Maui Community Plan serves as a guiding document for sustainable development and infrastructure planning in the region, ensuring that growth aligns with the needs and capacity of existing and future infrastructure; and WHEREAS, the proposed removal of the word "require" from the South Maui Community Plan in relation to infrastructure could weaken enforceability and accountability in ensuring that essential infrastructure improvements are constructed before or concurrently with new development projects; and WHEREAS, members of the Wailea community and residents of South Maui generally, have expressed significant concerns that loosening infrastructure requirements may lead to overdevelopment, increased traffic congestion, environmental degradation, and a strain on essential public services, including water supply, sewer capacity, and emergency response systems; and WHEREAS, requiring infrastructure to be completed before a development is occupied ensures that new residential and commercial projects do not overwhelm the community's roads, utilities, and public safety resources, thereby maintaining quality of life and sustainability; and WHEREAS, other municipalities across the United States, including those in California, Florida, and Colorado, have implemented similar policies mandating infrastructure completion before development occupancy to mitigate the negative effects of unchecked growth and protect long-term community interests; and WHEREAS, planning principles that prioritize infrastructure-first development enhance resilience against economic risks, improve public safety, and support the overall well-being of communities by preventing piecemeal and reactive infrastructure solutions; and WHEREAS, the South Maui region has experienced rapid population growth and increased tourism impacts, making it imperative that the Maui County Planning Department uphold stringent infrastructure requirements to ensure that development does not outpace the capacity of roads, drainage systems, wastewater treatment facilities, and other essential services; and WHEREAS, a failure to mandate infrastructure development before occupancy may lead to costly, taxpayer-funded retrofitting projects that could have been avoided with proactive planning and regulation enforcement; and WHEREAS, the Maui County Planning Department has a responsibility to uphold the public interest by ensuring that policies within the South Maui Community Plan reflect sound planning principles that prioritize infrastructure adequacy and sustainable growth; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, the House of Representatives concurring, that the Maui County Planning Department is urged to retain the word "require" in the South Maui Community Plan as it relates to infrastructure to ensure that development does not occur without adequate supporting infrastructure; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Maui County Planning Department is requested to consider policies adopted by other municipalities in the United States that mandate infrastructure completion before the occupancy of new developments as models for reinforcing sustainable growth in South Maui; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Mayor of County of Maui, Director of the Maui County Planning Department, and chair of the Maui County Council.
