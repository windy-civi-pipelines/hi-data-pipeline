hemp product retailer to confirm that a valid certificate of registration has
been obtained and is in compliance with any and all laws and regulations.</u></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <u>(c)  A manufactured hemp product distributor

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <u>(f)  The department shall post on its
website a current list of registrants on the registry.</u></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <u>(g)  The certificate of registration shall

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b><u>§328G-B</u> </b> <b><u>Unlawful hemp
retailing or distribution.</u></b>  <u>(a)  A person or entity required to be
registered as a manufactured hemp product retailer or manufactured hemp product

authority.</u></b>  <u>The department and the attorney general may inspect the
operations, premises, and storage areas of any entity engaged in the
distribution or sale of any product containing or derived from hemp, or
marketed as containing or being derived from hemp, during regular business
hours, to verify compliance with this chapter.  The inspection shall include examination
