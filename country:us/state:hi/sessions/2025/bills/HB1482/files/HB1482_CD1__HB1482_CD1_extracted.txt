(b)  Beginning January 1, 2026, no manufactured hemp product distributor or manufactured hemp product retailer shall sell or offer for sale manufactured hemp products without a certificate of registration issued by the department pursuant to this section.  It shall be the responsibility of the manufactured hemp product distributor or manufactured hemp product retailer to confirm that a valid certificate of registration has been obtained and is in compliance with any and all laws, rules, and regulations.

(l)  Hemp processors with a valid permit issued pursuant to section 328G-2 shall be issued a certificate of registration and added to the registry by the department for the sale and distribution of manufactured hemp products at the locations indicated on the permit.  The certificate of registration shall be issued with the same expiration date as found on the permit.  Application and renewal fees required in subsections (c) and (g) shall not apply to hemp processors with a valid permit issued pursuant to section 328G-2. (m)  This section shall not apply to the sale of the following manufactured hemp products: (1)  Products that are topically applied; or (2)  Tinctures; provided that tinctures shall not be sold to individuals under the age of twenty-one; provided further that the manufactured hemp products otherwise comply with this chapter and any rules adopted pursuant to this chapter. §328G-B  Unlawful hemp distribution or retailing.  (a) A person or entity required to be registered as a manufactured hemp product distributor or manufactured hemp product retailer under this chapter commits the offense of unlawful hemp distribution or retailing if the person or entity recklessly fails to register as a manufactured hemp product distributor or manufactured hemp product retailer as required under section 328G-A and, for the purposes of distribution or retail sale, recklessly sells, possesses, stores, acquires, or distributes any product containing or derived from hemp, or marketed as containing or being derived from hemp. (b)  Unlawful hemp distribution or retailing shall be a misdemeanor, except that any offense under subsection (a) that occurs within five years of a conviction for unlawful hemp distribution or retailing shall be a class C felony. §328G-C  Inspection authority.  The department and the attorney general may inspect the operations, premises, and storage areas of any entity engaged in the distribution or sale of any product containing or derived from hemp, or marketed as containing or being derived from hemp, during regular business hours, to verify compliance with this chapter. The inspection shall include examination of all statements, books, papers, and records in whatever format, including electronic format, pertaining to the cultivation, processing, acquisition, possession, transportation, sale, or use any product containing or derived from hemp, or marketed as containing or being derived from hemp.  The inspection may also include taking reasonable samples and conducting tests to verify compliance with this chapter. Every entity in possession of any statements, books, papers, and records, and the entity's agents and employees, shall be required to give the department and attorney general the means, facilities, and opportunities for the examinations. §328G-D  Forfeiture; confiscation and seizure; disposition.  (a) The department, attorney general, department of law enforcement, and the police department of each county may seize and confiscate any product containing or derived from hemp, or marketed as containing or being derived from hemp, that is possessed, kept, stored, retained, held, owned, received, acquired, distributed, sold, or offered for sale in violation of this chapter.

(d) It shall be unlawful for a person under twenty-one years of age to purchase or possess any tincture.  This provision shall not apply if a person under the age of twenty-one, with parental authorization, is participating in a controlled purchase as part of a law enforcement activity or a study authorized by the department under the supervision of law enforcement to determine the level of incidence of tincture sales to persons under twenty-one years of age. (e) Any person who violates subsection (a) shall be fined $500 for the first offense.  Any subsequent offenses shall subject the person to a fine no less than $500 and no more than $2,000.  Any person under twenty-one years of age who violates subsection (d) shall be fined $10 for the first offense.  Any subsequent offense shall subject the violator to a fine of $50, no part of which shall be suspended, or the person shall be required to perform no less than forty-eight hours and no more than seventy-two hours of community service during hours when the person is not employed and is not attending school. Any tincture in the person's possession at the time of violation of subsection (d) shall be seized, summarily forfeited to the State, and destroyed by law enforcement following the conclusion of an administrative or judicial proceeding finding that a violation of subsection (d) has been committed.  The procedures set forth in chapter 712A shall not apply to this subsection."
