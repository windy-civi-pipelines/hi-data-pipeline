HB1482 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1482 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT related to controlled substances. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that in recent years a growing variety of cannabis products, including those containing Delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-8 THC), have gained significant prevalence in Hawaii, leading to increased public use and commercial availability of these products.  Delta-8 THC has been marketed as a legal alternative to traditional cannabis, despite similar psychoactive properties between the two. The legislature further finds that the widespread availability and use of Delta-8 THC and similar cannabinoids have raised concerns about consumer safety, labeling accuracy, potential health risks, and the need for appropriate regulatory oversight.  Current state laws have not sufficiently addressed the growing market of these new cannabis-derived compounds, leaving gaps in regulation and enforcement.  It is therefore necessary for state law to evolve in response to the changing landscape of cannabis products, ensuring both consumer protection and public safety. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to amend the definitions of "artificially derived cannabis", "cannabis", and "manufactured hemp product" under the hemp processors law to include all forms of cannabinoids classified as schedule I under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act. SECTION 2.  Section 328G-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended as follows: 1.  By amending the definition of "artificially derived cannabinoid" to read: ""Artificially derived cannabinoid" means a chemical substance that is created by a chemical reaction that changes the molecular structure of any chemical substance derived from the plant genus cannabis.  "Artificially derived cannabinoid" includes any of the synthetic substances enumerated in section 329-14(g).  "Artificially derived cannabinoid" does not include: (1)  A naturally occurring chemical substance that is separated from the plant genus cannabis by a chemical or mechanical extraction process; or (2)  Cannabinoids that are produced by decarboxylation from naturally occurring cannabinoid acid without the use of a chemical catalyst." 2.  By amending the definition of "cannabis" to read: ""Cannabis" means the genus of the flowering plant in the family Cannabaceae. For the purpose of this chapter, cannabis refers to any form of the plant where the delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration on a dry weight basis has not yet been determined.  "Cannabis" includes any of the synthetic substances enumerated in section 329-14(g)." 3.  By amending the definition of "manufactured hemp product" to read: ""Manufactured hemp product" means a product created by processing, as defined in this chapter, that: (1)  Is either: (A)  Intended to be consumed orally to supplement the human or animal diet in tablet, capsule, powder, softgel, gelcap, or liquid form (e.g., hemp oil); or (B)  In a form for topical application to the skin or hair; (2)  Does not include any living hemp plants, viable seeds, leaf materials, or floral materials[;] or any of the synthetic substances enumerated in section 329-14(g); and (3)  Includes any other product specified by the department pursuant to section 328G-4(a)(7)." SECTION 3.  Section 329-14, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (g) to read as follows: "(g)  Any of the following cannabinoids, their salts, isomers, and salts of isomers, unless specifically excepted, whenever the existence of these salts, isomers, and salts of isomers is possible within the specific chemical designation: (1)  Tetrahydrocannabinols; meaning tetrahydrocannabinols naturally contained in a plant of the genus Cannabis (cannabis plant), as well as synthetic equivalents of the substances contained in the plant, or in the resinous extractives of Cannabis, sp. or synthetic substances, derivatives, and their isomers with similar chemical structure and pharmacological activity to those substances contained in the plant, such as the following: Delta 1 cis or trans tetrahydrocannabinol, and their optical isomers;
