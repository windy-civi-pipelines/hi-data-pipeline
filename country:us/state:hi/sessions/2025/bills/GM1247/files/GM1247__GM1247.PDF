STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 2
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO TORTURE.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that many forms of cruel
2 and degrading sadism are inadequately addressed under existing
3 criminal law. Some acts occur during aggravated kidnappings or
4 following repeated assaults. Other acts, such as starvation or
5 electrocution, may inflict immense suffering without technically
6 causing bodily injury. The common denominator for torture is
7 the pervasive physical and psychological control exercised over
8 the victim by the abuser.
9 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish the
10 offense of torture as a class A felony in the State.
11 SECTION 2. Chapter 707, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
12 amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated
13 and to read as follows:
14 "§707- Torture. (1) Any person who knowingly:
15 (a) Causes serious bodily injury to another person within
16 the actor's custody or physical control;

15 restriction of a person's movements or the forcible confinement
16 of the person so as to interfere with that person's liberty,
17 without that person's consent or without lawful authority.
18 "Deprives" or "restricts" means to withhold in a manner
19 that materially endangers the physical or mental health of a
20 minor or vulnerable person.

7 (4) Torture is a class A felony.
8 (5) Where the conduct consists of depriving the minor or

13 matured, penalties that were incurred, and proceedings that were
14 begun before its effective date.
15 SECTION 4. If any provision of this Act, or the
16 application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held
