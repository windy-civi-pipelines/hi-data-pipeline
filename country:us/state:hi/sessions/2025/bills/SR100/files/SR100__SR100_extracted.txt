Section 1:
SR100 THE SENATE S.R. NO. 100 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII SENATE RESOLUTION requesting the department of Land and natural resources to convene a kailua bay advisory working group. WHEREAS, the Kailua-Kona Wharf, commonly referred to as the Kailua Pier, in Kailua-Kona, Hawaiʻi Island, serves as a vital hub for place-based cultural history, community gatherings, ocean-based tourism, and recreational activities which supports local businesses and enhances the economy of West Hawaiʻi; and WHEREAS, Kailua Pier and the surrounding area of Kailua Bay hold deep cultural and historical significance to the Hawaiʻi Island community as a sacred and political center for Native Hawaiians, serving as the royal residence of King Kamehameha I in his later years and the site of Ahuʻena Heiau, where the King governed and upheld traditional Hawaiian practices; and WHEREAS, Kailua Bay witnessed pivotal moments in Hawaiian history, including the transition from the traditional kapu system to a new era of governance in 1819, marking a profound shift in the cultural and societal structure of Hawaiʻi; and WHEREAS, the area has remained a vital hub for maritime activity, commerce, and cultural traditions, sustaining generations of Native Hawaiian fishers, voyagers, and practitioners who continue to honor the ancestral connection to the land and ocean; and WHEREAS, today, the Kailua Pier provides essential access for fishing, boating, and cultural events, including the annual Queen Liliʻuokalani Canoe Race, the IRONMAN World Championship, and traditional Hawaiian ceremonies, fostering both economic growth and cultural preservation; and WHEREAS, in addition to servicing local residents, the Kailua Pier serves as a key arrival point for cruise ships, bringing thousands of visitors to West Hawaiʻi each year, who contribute significantly to the region's economy through tourism-related spending by supporting local businesses, restaurants, tour operators, and cultural sites; and WHEREAS, the high level of activity at the Kailua Pier has resulted in persistent challenges related to homelessness, including the frequent vandalism of public facilities, damage to restroom infrastructure, and unauthorized encampments, creating ongoing safety and sanitation concerns for residents and visitors; and WHEREAS, while maintenance of the Kailua Pier is essential for public safety, environmental protection, and the long-term benefit of the community, persistent vandalism and destruction of public restrooms and infrastructure have led to rising maintenance costs, disruptions to public access, and the need for continuous repairs by state and county agencies; and WHEREAS, the management and operations of Kailua Pier fall under the jurisdiction of multiple government agencies, including the Department of Land and Natural Resources, various departments of the County of Hawaiʻi such as Parks and Recreation and the Police Department as well as federal entities such as the United States Coast Guard; and WHEREAS, local nonprofit organizations, including Destination Kona Coast, play a crucial role in visitor education and greeting programs while serving as dedicated stewards of Kailua Pier, actively monitoring its operations, identifying facility concerns, and relaying issues to government officials in a timely manner; and WHEREAS, adopting an interjurisdictional approach to addressing challenges at Kailua Pier would enhance communication between pier users and government officials, while fostering coordinated oversight and effective management among responsible authorities; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, that the Department of Land and Natural Resources is requested to convene a Kailua Bay Advisory Working Group; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Kailua Bay Advisory Working Group is requested to: (1)  Provide a structured forum for state, county, and community stakeholders to collaborate on interjurisdictional issues affecting Kailua Pier;
