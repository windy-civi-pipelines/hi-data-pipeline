A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO THE TRANSITION OF THE OAHU REGIONAL HEALTH CARE
SYSTEM FROM THE HAWAII HEALTH SYSTEMS CORPORATION INTO THE
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 PART I
2 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that Act 212, Session
3 Laws of Hawaii 2021, required the transfer of the Oahu regional
4 health care system (Oahu region) from the Hawaii health systems
5 corporation to the department of health due to the logistical
6 complexities of the Oahu region facilities and the limited but
7 crucial nature of the services these facilities, Leahi Hospital
8 and Maluhia, currently provide. The legislature further finds
9 that it is more appropriate for the department of health and
10 Oahu region to form a partnership to assist with the needs of
11 patients from the Hawaii state hospital.
12 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
13 (1) Repeal the requirement to transfer the Oahu region
14 from the Hawaii health systems corporation to the
15 department of health;
2025-3042 SB1441 HD2 HMSO-1

S.B. NO. 3--
1 (2) Repeal certain changes to the Hawaii Revised Statutes
2 that were made by Act 212, Session Laws of Hawaii
3 2021;
4 (3) Require the Oahu region and the department of health
5 to enter into a formal memorandum of agreement
6 regarding the care of certain psychiatrically stable
7 patients transferred or discharged from the Hawaii
8 state hospital to an appropriate Oahu region facility,
9 subject to certain conditions; and
10 (4) Require the Oahu region to submit a report to the
11 legislature.
12 PART II
13 SECTION 2. Act 212, Session Laws of Hawaii 2021, as
14 amended by section 2 of Act 150, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022, is
