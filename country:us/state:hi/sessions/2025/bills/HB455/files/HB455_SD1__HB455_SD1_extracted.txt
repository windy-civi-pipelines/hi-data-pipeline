Section 1:
HB455 SD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 455 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII S.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO SMALL BUSINESS LOANS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain issues, and inflation have hurt the State's economy and local businesses on every level, including the start-up industry.  Despite this, many small businesses and entrepreneurs are ready to take the leap into starting up a business but lack the resources to do so, as access to capital is one of the biggest barriers for start-ups. The legislature further finds that new businesses and young companies under five years of age create the most new jobs, on net, in the United States.  While the State offers a variety of financial assistance to start-up businesses in Hawaii, most assistance is to help existing businesses expand and scale up, rather than to help successfully launch new businesses. The legislature believes that providing support to local small businesses and entrepreneurs looking to begin a start-up could lead to the creation of more jobs in the State. The purpose of this Act is to benefit the local economy and create new jobs by establishing and appropriating funds for a Hawaii start-up business loan program to encourage entrepreneurship, economic diversification, and resilience.
