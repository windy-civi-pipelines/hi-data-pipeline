Section 1:
SB756 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 756 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF LAND AND NATURAL RESOURCES. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii's natural resources are among the State's most precious assets.  These resources are vital to the strength of Hawaii's environment, economy, and cultural heritage.  Effective conservation enforcement is critical to safeguard these resources from unlawful exploitation and degradation. The legislature further finds that the department of land and natural resources' DLNRTip application provides an important mechanism for citizens to report natural resource violations directly to the department of land and natural resources. However, the legislature also finds that the application has faced challenges due to inconsistent monitoring, which has led to delayed or no responses, the loss of critical evidence, and a decline in public trust.  These shortcomings have hindered the application's ability to function as an effective enforcement tool. The legislature recognizes the increasing demand for citizen involvement in conservation enforcement.  Given the extensive scope of natural resource protection and the limitations of available enforcement personnel, citizen reporting is essential for bridging enforcement gaps. To address these issues, this Act codifies the DLNRTip application into the Hawaii Revised Statutes and provides critical resources to increase the application's effectiveness.  This change will help to ensure that the department of land and natural resources properly monitors the application and responds to reports in a timely fashion. The resources provided by this Act will also help to enhance the application's capabilities, establish dedicated staffing, and mandate comprehensive reporting to the legislature on the application's use and effectiveness. The legislature believes that this Act will restore public confidence in the DLNRTip application and maximize the application's potential as a tool to protect Hawaii's natural resources. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Establish the DLNRTip application as the official electronic platform for persons to report natural resource violations to the division of conservation and resources enforcement; (2)  Establish statutory requirements regarding the design and maintenance of the DLNRTip application; (3)  Require the department of land and natural resources to ensure that all information submitted through the DLNRTip application is continuously monitored to facilitate timely enforcement responses; (4)  Require annual reports to the legislature on the use and effectiveness of the DLNRTip application; and (5)  Appropriate moneys to implement and maintain the DLNRTip application and to establish one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) position to support the operation of the DLNRTip application. SECTION 2. Chapter 199, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part    .
