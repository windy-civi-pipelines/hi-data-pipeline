SCR118 SD1 THE SENATE S.C.R. NO. 118 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION Requesting the department of health to convene a working group to assess the feasibility of ALLOWING business owners IN THE STATE to utilize filtered water collected by water catchment systems for business activities. WHEREAS, there is an imminent potable water shortage threat that has left many individuals across the State without direct or convenient access to safe drinking water; and WHEREAS, due to recent high-profile petroleum leaks coupled with drought conditions, the Board of Water Supply of the City and County of Honolulu was forced to take precautionary measures and shut down the Hālawa Shaft, Hālawa Wells, and Aiea Wells, further restricting access to potable water for local communities; and WHEREAS, access to water is a prerequisite to addressing many of the State's current problems relating to developing affordable housing, empowering local businesses, diversifying the economy, and improving the economic stability of the State's most vulnerable residents; and WHEREAS, pursuing innovative solutions to decrease use of the State's limited aquifers is critical to addressing the fragility of the State's water system; and WHEREAS, water catchment systems are one innovative solution that can supplement potable water systems and conserve natural resources by efficiently capturing and utilizing rainwater while maintaining existing state water infrastructure, including both municipal water and stormwater systems; and WHEREAS, while a significant number of people in the State are dependent on rainwater catchment as their primary domestic water source, existing law allows captured water for personal use only and prohibits the use of captured water for business activities; and WHEREAS, revised guidelines from the College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resiliency at the University of Hawaiʻi at Manoa outline a safe process for utilizing water captured for personal use that can be appropriately applied to business activities under certain regulatory conditions; and WHEREAS, studying the feasibility of allowing business owners in the State to utilize filtered water collected by water catchment systems for business activities is critical to decrease Hawaii's dependency upon stressed aquifer and water systems and assist in the diversification of the State's water sources; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, the House of Representatives concurring, that the Department of Health is requested to convene a Business Activity Water Catchment System Working Group;
