If a member, who became a member before July 1, 2012, has credited service as
an elective officer or as a legislative officer, the member's retirement
allowance shall be derived by adding the allowances computed separately under
paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) as follows:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  For a member who has credited service as an
elective officer before July 1, 2012, irrespective of age, for each year of
credited service as an elective officer, three and one-half per cent of the
member's average final compensation as computed under section 88&#8209;81(e)(1),
in addition to an annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the member's
accumulated contributions allocable to the period of service;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  For a member, who first earned credited service
as an elective officer after June 30, 2012, irrespective of age, for each year
of credited service as an elective officer, three per cent of the member's
average final compensation as computed under section 88-81(e)(1), in addition
to an annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the member's accumulated
contributions allocable to the period of service;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  For a member who has credited service as a
legislative officer before July 1, 2012, irrespective of age, for each year of
credited service as a legislative officer, three and one-half per cent of the
member's average final compensation as computed under section 88-81(e)(2), in
addition to an annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the member's
accumulated contributions allocable to the period of service;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  For a member who first earned credited service as
a legislative officer after June 30, 2012, irrespective of age, for each year
of credited service as a legislative officer, three per cent of the member's
average final compensation as computed under section 88-81(e)(2), in addition
to an annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the member's accumulated
contributions allocable to the period of service;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  If the member has credited service as a judge,
the member's retirement allowance shall be computed on the following basis:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          (A)  For a member who has credited service as
a judge before July 1, 1999, irrespective of age, for each year of credited
service as a judge, three and one-half per cent of the member's average final
compensation as computed under section 88&#8209;81(e)(3), in addition to an
annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the member's accumulated
contributions allocable to the period of service;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          (B)  For a member who first earned credited
service as a judge after June 30, 1999, but before July 1, 2012, and has
attained the age of fifty-five, for each year of credited service as a judge, three
and one-half per cent of the member's average final compensation as computed
under section 88&#8209;81(e)(3), in addition to an annuity that is the
actuarial equivalent of the member's accumulated contributions allocable to the
period of service.  If the member has not attained age fifty-five, the member's
retirement allowance shall be computed as though the member had attained age
fifty-five, reduced for age as provided in subsection (e); and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          (C)  For a member who first earned credited
service as a judge after June 30, 2012, and has attained the age of sixty, for
each year of credited service as a judge, three per cent of the member's
average final compensation as computed under section 88-81(e)(3), in addition
to an annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the member's accumulated
contributions allocable to the period of service.  If the member has not attained
age sixty, the member's retirement allowance shall be computed as though the

<p class=ASubparagraph>          <u>(D)</u>  <u>For a member who has credited
service as a judge after January 31, 2025, irrespective of age, for each year
of credited service as a judge, one and three-fourths per cent of the member's
average final compensation as computed under section 88&#8209;81(e)(3); and</u></p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  For each year of credited service not included in
paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), or (5), the average final compensation as
computed under section 88&#8209;81(e)(4) shall be multiplied by two per cent
for credited service earned as a class A or class H member, two and one-half
per cent for credited service earned as a class B member, and one and
one-quarter per cent for credited service earned as a class C member.  If the
member has not attained age fifty-five, the member's retirement allowance shall
be computed as though the member had attained age fifty-five, reduced for age
as provided in subsection (e).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>The total retirement allowance shall not exceed
seventy-five per cent of the member's highest average final compensation
calculated under section 88-81(e)(1), (2), (3), or (4).  If the allowance
exceeds this limit, it shall be adjusted by reducing any annuity accrued under
paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) and the portion of the accumulated
contributions specified in these paragraphs in excess of the requirements of
the reduced annuity shall be returned to the member upon the member's
retirement or paid to the member's designated beneficiary upon the member's
death while in service or while on authorized leave without pay.  If a member
has service credit as an elective officer or as a legislative officer in
addition to service credit as a judge, then the retirement benefit calculation
contained in this subsection shall supersede the formula contained in
subsection (c).&quot;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs align=center style='text-align:center'>PART II</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     SECTION 2.  The legislature finds that
employees who became members of the employees' retirement system before July 1,
2012, commonly referred to as &quot;Tier 1 members&quot;, are required to have
a minimum of five years of credited service to be eligible for vested benefit
status, which, among other things, permits a member to receive a retirement
allowance upon service retirement.  By contrast, employees who become members
after June 30, 2012, commonly referred to as &quot;Tier 2 members&quot;, are
required to have a minimum of ten years of credited service to be eligible for
vested benefit status.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Although the two-tier member structure has
assisted the employees' retirement system in its efforts to achieve full
funding of its actuarial accrued liability, actuaries have determined that
reducing the minimum number of years of credited service Tier 2 members must
have to be eligible for vested benefit status from ten years to five years to
match Tier 1 members would increase the projected full funding period only by
an estimated four additional months and would require an increase in employer
contribution rates of less than a quarter per cent.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature also finds that reducing the
minimum number of years of credited service Tier 2 members must have to be
eligible for vested benefit status from ten years to five years would help
state and county employers with the recruitment and retention of qualified
employees.  Reducing employee turnover and retaining employees on the job
longer may also help to reduce employer costs.  The legislature further finds
that these benefits outweigh impacts to the employees' retirement system's
unfunded liability and projected full funding period, as well as to employer
contributions.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Notwithstanding section 88-99, Hawaii Revised
Statutes, the purpose of this part is to:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Reduce the minimum number of years of credited
service qualified Tier 2 members must have to be eligible for vested benefit
status for service retirement allowance purposes from ten years to five years;
and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Increase employer contributions to offset the
liability produced by the vesting changes.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     SECTION 3.  Section 88-62, Hawaii Revised
Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows:</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;(b)  [<s>For</s>] <u>Notwithstanding
section 88-99, for</u> members who become members after June 30, 2012:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  If a former member who has fewer than ten years
of credited service and who has been out of service for a period of four full
calendar years or more after the year in which the former member left service,
or if a former member who withdrew the former member's accumulated
contributions returns to service, the former member shall become a member in
the same manner and under the same conditions as anyone first entering service;
however, the former member may obtain membership service credit in the manner provided
by applicable law for credited service that was forfeited by the member upon
termination of the member's previous membership.  If the member did not
withdraw the former member's accumulated contributions prior to the former
member's return to service, the accumulated contributions shall be returned to
the member as part of the process of enrolling the member in the system if the
member's accumulated contributions are $1,000 or less at the time of
distribution.  If the accumulated contributions for the service the member had
when the member previously terminated employment are greater than $1,000 and
the member does not make written application, prior to or contemporaneously
with the member's return to service, for return of the accumulated contributions,
the member may not withdraw the member's accumulated contributions, except as
provided by section 88-96 or 88-341, until the member retires or attains age
sixty-two.  The member shall not be entitled to service credit by reason of the
system's retention of the member's accumulated contributions for the service
the member had when the member previously terminated employment.  To be
eligible for any benefit, the member shall fulfill the membership service
requirements for the benefit through membership service after again becoming a
member, in addition to meeting any other eligibility requirement established
for the benefit; provided that the membership service requirement shall be
exclusive of any former service acquired in accordance with section 88-59 or any
other section in part II, VII, or VIII;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  If a former member with fewer than ten years of
credited service and who did not withdraw the former member's accumulated
contributions returns to service within four full calendar years after the year
in which the former member left service, the former member shall again become a
member in the same manner and under the same conditions as anyone first
entering service, except that the member shall be credited with service credit
for the service the member had when the member terminated employment:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          (A)  If the member returns to service as a
class A or class B member, the member's new and previous accumulated
contributions shall be combined; or</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          (B)  If the member returns to service as a
class H member, section 88-321(b) shall apply; [<s>and</s>]</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  If a former member [<s>with ten or more years of
credited service who did not withdraw the former member's contributions</s>] <u>who
has vested benefit status as provided in section 88-96(b)</u> returns to
service, the former member's status shall be in accordance with the provisions
described in section 88-97[<s>.</s>]<u>;</u></p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     <u>(4)</u>  <u>If a former member who has fewer than
five years of credited service and who has been out of service </u><u>for a
period of four full calendar years or more after the year in which the former
member left service, or if a former member withdrew the former member's
accumulated contributions returns to service and remains in service as of July
1, 2027, or returns to service after June 30, 2027, the former member shall
become a member in the same manner and under the same conditions as anyone
first entering service; provided that the former member may obtain membership
service credit in the manner provided by applicable law for credited service
that was forfeited by the member upon termination of the member's previous
membership.  If the member did not withdraw the former member's accumulated
contributions before the former member's return to service, the accumulated
contributions shall be returned to the member as part of the process of
enrolling the member in the system if the member's accumulated contributions
are $1,000 or less at the time of distribution.  If the accumulated
contributions for the service the member had when the member previously
