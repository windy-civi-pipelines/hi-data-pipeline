A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO SENTENCING.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAH:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that through a court
2 decision, Massachusetts became the first state to ban life
3 without parole sentences for individuals eighteen years old
4 through twenty years old, considering those in this age group to
5 be "emerging adults". The court extended the bright line age
6 cut-off from eighteen years of age to twenty years of age, in
7 part, due to neuroscience research that supports that brain
8 maturation continues through an individual's mid-twenties.
9 The purpose of this Act is to prohibit sentencing
10 defendants who were under the age of twenty-one at the time of
11 the offense to life imprisonment without the possibility of
12 parole.
13 SECTION 2. Chapter 706, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
14 amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated
15 and to read as follows:
16 ”§706- Life imprisonment without the possibility of
17 parole; persons under the age of twenty-one; prohibited.
2025-3367 HB103 CDl HMSO

Page 2 H.B. NO.
1 Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, no person
2 convicted of a crime who was under the age of twenty-one at the
3 time of the offense shall be sentenced to life imprisonment
4 without the possibility of parole."
5 SECTION 3. Section 706-656, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
6 amended by amending subsection (1) to read as follows:
7 " (1) Persons [eighteen] twenty-one years of age or [ev^]
8 older at the time of the offense who are convicted of first
9 degree murder or first degree attempted murder shall be
10 sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of
11 parole.
12 As part of th^ sentence, the court shall order the
13 director of corrections and rehabilitation and the Hawaii
14 paroling authority to prepare an application for the governor to
15 commute the sentence to life imprisonment with parole at the end
16 of twenty years of imprisonment; provided that persons who are
17 repeat offenders under section 706-606.5 shall serve at least
18 the applicable mandatory minimum term of imprisonment.
19 Persons under the age of [eightoen] twenty-one years at the
20 time of the offense who are convicted of first degree murder or
2025-3367 HB103 CDl HMSO 2

3^1
1 first degree attempted murder shall be sentenced to life
2 imprisonment with the possibility of parole."
3 SECTION 4. Section 706-657, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
4 amended to read as follows:
5 "§706-657 Enhanced sentence for second degree murder.
6 The court may sentence a person who was [eighteen] twenty-one
7 years of age or [over] older at the time of the offense and who
8 has been convicted of murder in the second degree to life
9 imprisonment without the possibility of parole under section
10 706-656 if the court finds that the murder was especially
11 heinous, atrocious, or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity
12 or that the person was previously convicted of the offense of
13 murder in the first degree or murder in the second degree in
14 this State or was previously convicted in another jurisdiction
15 of an offense that would constitute murder in the first degree
16 or murder in the second degree in this State. [As us-ed in-fe-hi-s-

3 (b) Hearings to determine the grounds for imposing an
4 enhanced sentence for second degree murder may be initiated by
5 the prosecutor or by the court on its own motion. The court
6 shall not impose an enhanced term unless the ground therefor has
7 been established at a hearing after the conviction of the
8 defendant and on written notice to the defendant of the ground
9 proposed. Subject to the provision of section 706-604, the
10 defendant shall have the right to hear and controvert the
11 evidence against the defendant and to offer evidence upon the
12 issue.

15 section.

19 that is unnecessarily torturous to a victim.

4 SECTION 5. Section 706-662, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
5 amended to read as follows:
6 "§706-662 Criteria for extended terms of imprisonment. A
7 defendant who has been convicted of a felony may be subject to
8 an extended term of imprisonment under section 706-661 if it is
9 proven beyond a reasonable doubt that an extended term of

12 following criteria:
