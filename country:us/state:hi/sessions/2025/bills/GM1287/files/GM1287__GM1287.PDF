THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO INTEGRATED LAND USE.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAH:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that multiple climate and
2 sustainability statutory targets have been enacted in the State,
3 including developing at least 22,500 affordable rental housing
4 units, doubling food production, increasing food exports,
5 requiring the department of education and university of Hawaii
6 to become net-zero in energy use, requiring that all of the
7 electricity generated in Hawaii comes from renewable sources,
8 sequestering more atmospheric carbon and greenhouse gases,
9 requiring all state and county facilities to use reclaimed
10 water, and requiring the mandatory upgrade of all cesspools.
11 The legislature recognizes that, with the recent expansion
12 of the office of planning and sustainable development through
13 Act 45, Session Laws of Hawaii 2020, and Acts 152 and 153,
14 Session Laws of Hawaii 2021, the office of planning and
15 sustainable development functionally serves as the State's
16 centralized coordinating agency to lead efforts in climate
17 adaptive and sustainable land use policies.

1 The legislature further finds that the State would benefit
2 from a land use plan that integrates various climate and
3 sustainability goals and studies, especially on the use of
4 agricultural lands. An integrated land use study would help to
5 address recent events and public opposition to affordable
6 housing projects and renewable energy projects on agricultural
7 land.
8 The purpose of this Act is to require the office of
9 planning and sustainable development to conduct an integrated
10 land use study that incorporates the various climate and
11 sustainability goals and studies to serve as a guide for
12 planning and decision making on the use of agricultural lands.
13 SECTION 2. (a) The office of planning and sustainable
14 development shall conduct an integrated land use study for
15 agricultural districts as classified under section 205-2, Hawaii
16 Revised Statutes.
17 (b) The purpose of the integrated land use study shall be
18 to:
19 (1) Develop land use data that can be used for planning
20 and decision making for the competing uses of lands
21 within agricultural districts; and

17 study required pursuant to Act 189, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022.
18 (e) The integrated land use study shall include
19 recommendations for each county.
