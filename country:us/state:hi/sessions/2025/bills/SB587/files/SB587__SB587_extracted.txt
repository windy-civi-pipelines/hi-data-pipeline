SB587 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 587 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to renewable energy. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that pursuant to Act 97, Session Laws of Hawaii 2015, Hawaii has committed to achieving a one hundred percent renewable portfolio standard by December 31, 2045.  This transition away from imported fossil fuels toward locally available renewable energy sources is critical for ensuring the State's energy independence, economic sustainability, and environmental resilience. The legislature further finds that the transition to a clean energy economy requires customer-friendly processes to enable widespread adoption of distributed energy resources and electrification technologies.  Current interconnection and utility service upgrade processes have led to delays, unexpected costs, and increased customer dissatisfaction, hindering progress toward achieving the State's clean energy goals.  These challenges also result in localized power quality issues and power outages when customers increase loads without informing the utility. The legislature finds that establishing streamlined and transparent interconnection processes will encourage consumer adoption, enable proactive utility planning, and ensure reliability and cost-effectiveness in the power system.  The integration of smart inverters and other customer-sited technologies is critical to minimizing grid investments and achieving a clean, sustainable energy future. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish a grid-ready home interconnection process that supports the rapid adoption of clean energy technologies, facilitates smart utility investments, and ensures power system reliability. SECTION 2.  Section 269-141, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new definition to be appropriately inserted and to read as follows: ""Grid-ready home" means a residential property equipped or modified to anticipate and streamline the integration of clean electrification technologies such as electric vehicle chargers and heat pumps, distributed energy resources such as photovoltaic systems, batteries leveraging current national standards for functionality such as UL 1741, and advanced grid modernization technology."
