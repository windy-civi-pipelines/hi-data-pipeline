NO. 150 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION requesting the Department of Transportation to convene a working group to develop and recommend federal, state, and county programs subsidizing the transport of waterborne cargo. WHEREAS, S.R. No. 125, S.D. 1, (2020) requested that the Public Utilities Commission, in collaboration with the Division of Consumer Advocacy of the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs and any interisland water carriers operating in the State, convene a Water Carrier Working Group to recommend mid‑term and long-term solutions that would balance the need for continuous interisland water carrier services throughout the State with the need for water carriers to maintain financial sustainability; and WHEREAS, on December 27, 2021, the Water Carrier Working Group issued its final report on its findings and recommendations (report); and WHEREAS, the report noted that the State's communities are largely dependent on the import of goods, finding that more than eighty percent of goods consumed in the State are imported, with ninety-eight percent of those goods being transported as waterborne cargo; and WHEREAS, the report further noted that unlike other communities in the continental United States that have alternative means of transporting goods by freight and rail, the geography of the State necessitates the employment of water carriers to transport goods; and WHEREAS, the report additionally noted that the cost of shipping goods to and within the State inflates the cost of imported goods consumed in the State by as much as 7.5 percent; and WHEREAS, the report additionally noted that the State's dependence on imported goods necessitates maritime support to ensure food security in the State; and WHEREAS, the report also noted that while agricultural specific subsidies exist for aircraft that transport cargo to remote destination, similar subsidies do not exist for general cargo transport to and within the State; and WHEREAS, the report recommended that the funding required to subsidize general cargo transport be sourced from existing or newly created federal, state, and county government programs; and WHEREAS, the report also recommended that the Legislature pass a resolution requesting the Department of Transportation to convene a working group to develop and recommend federal, state, and county subsidies for the transport of waterborne cargo, and to provide the Legislature with a status update of these programs no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2023; and WHEREAS, the report specifically recommended that the Department of Transportation lead a committee to continue working and consulting with the United States Department of Transportation in the establishment of a federal waterborne cargo subsidies program, including the drafting of legislative language; and WHEREAS, the report further specifically recommended that the Department of Transportation lead a committee to work and consult with the Hawaii State Senate and House of Representatives committees with jurisdiction over transportation, county departments of transportation, and county councils in the establishment of a local waterborne cargo subsidies program, including the drafting of legislation; and WHEREAS, the report also specifically recommended that the Department of Transportation lead a committee to work and consult with the Hawaii congressional delegation to sponsor a bill establishing a federal waterborne cargo subsides program within the United States Department of Transportation; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, the House of Representatives concurring, that the Department of Transportation is requested to convene a working group to develop and recommend federal, state, and county programs subsidizing the transport of waterborne cargo;
