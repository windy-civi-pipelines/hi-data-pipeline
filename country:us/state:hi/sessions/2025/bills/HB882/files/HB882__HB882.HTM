Section 1:
HB882 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 882 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT Relating to income tax credits. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the film industry in Hawaii is an important component of a diversified economy.  The legislature also finds that the existing income tax credit is not reflective of the current volume of business of the State's film industry.  Additionally, other jurisdictions are becoming more friendly and fiscally enticing for motion picture, digital media, and film production decision makers. Hawaii can look to the recent success in Georgia, where its exemplar film tax credit provided $8.55 billion in economic impact in 2022.  Georgia's film tax credit currently has a return on investment of $6.30 per every $1 issued as a tax credit.  Georgia's tax incentive was the most important factor in attracting production companies into the state and influencing their decision to film in the state.  Further, Georgia's tax credit created almost sixty thousand jobs within the state in 2022. The purpose of this Act is to stimulate the motion picture, digital media, and film production industry in Hawaii and incentivize hiring Hawaii residents by amending the amount of total income tax credits available and providing the State with alternative marketing opportunities in lieu of a shared-card, end-title screen credit. SECTION 2.  Section 235-17, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§235-17  Motion picture, digital media, and film production income tax credit.  [Repeal and reenactment on January 1, 2033.  L 2022, c 217, §4.]  (a)  Any law to the contrary notwithstanding, there shall be allowed to each taxpayer subject to the taxes imposed by this chapter, an income tax credit that shall be deductible from the taxpayer's net income tax liability, if any, imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in which the credit is properly claimed. The amount of the credit shall be: (1)  Twenty-two per cent of the qualified production costs incurred by a qualified production in any county of the State with a population of over seven hundred thousand; [or] (2)  Twenty-seven per cent of the qualified production costs incurred by a qualified production in any county of the State with a population of seven hundred thousand or less[.]; or (3)  Thirty per cent of the qualified production costs incurred by a qualified production in any county of the State if twenty-five per cent of talent and crew paid for services performed relating to the qualified production are individuals residing in Hawaii. A qualified production occurring in more than one county may prorate its expenditures based upon the amounts spent in each county, if the population bases differ enough to change the percentage of tax credit. In the case of a partnership, S corporation, estate, or trust, the tax credit allowable is for qualified production costs incurred by the entity for the taxable year.  The cost upon which the tax credit is computed shall be determined at the entity level.  Distribution and share of credit shall be determined by rule. If a deduction is taken under section 179 (with respect to election to expense depreciable business assets) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, no tax credit shall be allowed for those costs for which the deduction is taken. The basis for eligible property for depreciation of accelerated cost recovery system purposes for state income taxes shall be reduced by the amount of credit allowable and claimed. (b) The credit allowed under this section shall be claimed against the net income tax liability for the taxable year. For the purposes of this section, "net income tax liability" means net income tax liability reduced by all other credits allowed under this chapter. (c) If the tax credit under this section exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability, the excess of credits over liability shall be refunded to the taxpayer; provided that no refunds or payment on account of the tax credits allowed by this section shall be made for amounts less than $1.  All claims, including any amended claims, for tax credits under this section shall be filed on or before the end of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the credit may be claimed.  Failure to comply with any of the foregoing provision shall constitute a waiver of the right to claim the credit. (d) To qualify for this tax credit, a production shall: (1)  Meet the definition of a qualified production specified in subsection (o); (2)  Have qualified production costs totaling at least $100,000; (3)  Provide the State a qualified Hawaii promotion, which shall be [at]: (A)  At minimum, a shared-card, end-title screen credit, where applicable; or (B)  Alternative marketing opportunities, approves by the department of business, economic development, and tourism, that offer equal or greater promotional value to the State than the shared-card, end-title screen credit; (4)  Provide evidence of reasonable efforts to hire local talent and crew; (5)  Provide evidence when making any claim for products or services acquired or rendered outside of this State that reasonable efforts were unsuccessful to secure and use comparable products or services within this State; (6)  Provide evidence of financial or in-kind contributions or educational or workforce development efforts, in partnership with related local industry labor organizations, educational institutions, or both, toward the furtherance of the local film and television and digital media industries; (7)  Be compliant with all applicable requirements under title 14, including tax return filing and payments; and (8)  Provide complete responses to the department of taxation's inquiries and document requests, in the form prescribed by the department, no later than ninety days from the inquiry or request. (e) On or after July 1, 2006, no qualified production cost that has been financed by investments for which a credit was claimed by any taxpayer pursuant to section 235-110.9 is eligible for credits under this section. (f) To receive the tax credit, the taxpayer shall first prequalify the production for the credit by registering with the department of business, economic development, and tourism during the development or preproduction stage. (g) The director of taxation shall prepare forms as may be necessary to claim a credit under this section.  The director may also require the taxpayer to furnish information to ascertain the validity of the claim for credit made under this section and may adopt rules necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section pursuant to chapter 91. (h) Every taxpayer claiming a tax credit under this section for a qualified production shall, no later than ninety days following the end of each taxable year in which qualified production costs were expended, submit a written, sworn statement to the department of business, economic development, and tourism that identifies: (1)  All qualified production costs as provided by subsection (a), if any, incurred in the previous taxable year; (2)  The amount of tax credits claimed pursuant to this section, if any, in the previous taxable year; and (3)  The number of total hires versus the number of local hires by category and by county. This information may be reported from the department of business, economic development, and tourism to the legislature pursuant to subsection (i)(4). (i) The department of business, economic development, and tourism shall: (1)  Maintain records of the names of the taxpayers and qualified productions thereof claiming the tax credits under subsection (a); (2)  Obtain and total the aggregate amounts of all qualified production costs per qualified production and per qualified production per taxable year; (3)  Provide a letter to the director of taxation specifying the amount of the tax credit per qualified production for each taxable year that a tax credit is claimed and the cumulative amount of the tax credit for all years claimed; and (4)  Submit a report to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular session detailing [the]: (A)  The non-aggregated qualified production costs that form the basis of the tax credit claims and expenditures, itemized by taxpayer, in a redacted format to preserve the confidentiality and that shall include the dollar amount claimed, name of company, and name of the qualified production of the taxpayers claiming the credit[.]; and (B)  The marketing opportunities the department of business, economic development, and tourism has approved under subsection (d)(3)(B), including: (i)  The goals and strategy justifying each of those approved marketing opportunities; and (ii)  The names of all production companies who opted to include a shared-cared, end-title screen credit in their final production instead of offering the State an alternative marketing proposal.
