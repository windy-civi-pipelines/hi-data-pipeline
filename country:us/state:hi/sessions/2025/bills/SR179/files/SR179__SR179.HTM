WHEREAS, among the concerns raised by growing foreign influence in the United States and Hawaii, protecting critical infrastructure such as airports and transportation hubs, freshwater systems, electrical grids, and telecommunications networks has been identified by federal authorities as an urgent security priority; and WHEREAS, these critical infrastructure systems are essential to the State's local economy, public health and safety, and overall stability, making them prime targets for foreign interference; and WHEREAS, numerous federal agencies responsible for national security have demonstrated that foreign governments, including those of adversarial countries, are actively seeking ways to access and control the United States' critical infrastructure; and WHEREAS, foreign access to critical infrastructure may allow malicious actors to disrupt essential services, steal sensitive data, or compromise security; and WHEREAS, even allied countries may inadvertently or intentionally exploit access to advance their own agendas, which may be at odds with the interests of the United States and the State, especially because the interests and leadership of these countries may change rapidly; and WHEREAS, a cautious and strategic approach to foreign investment and influence is therefore critical to safeguarding the State's interests; and WHEREAS, by limiting foreign influence and strengthening oversight of the State's critical infrastructure systems, the State can ensure the resilience and security of its infrastructure against evolving threats, preserve public trust, guard national security, and protect its interests; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, that this body urges increased caution concerning foreign influence in Hawaii's critical infrastructure; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Governor, Director of Transportation, and Attorney General.
