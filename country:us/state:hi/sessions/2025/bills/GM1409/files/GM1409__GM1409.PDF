STATE OF HAWAII
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO PARENTAGE.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAH:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the State's existing
2 parentage laws need to be updated to include current concepts of
3 families, parenthood, conception, gestation, and parental
4 rights. The legislature further finds that the Uniform
5 Parentage Act of 2017, among other things, ensures the equal
6 treatment of children born to same-gender couples, adds an
7 additional status of functional parent as a legal parent, and
8 includes provisions that reflect developments in surrogacy and
5 assisted reproductive technology.
10 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to adopt portions
11 of the Uniform Parentage Act of 2017 to update existing law.
12 SECTION 2. The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by
13 adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read
14 as follows:

4 of the child, shall not be computed;
5 (3) This section shall not extend the time within which a
6 right of inheritance or a right to a succession may be

11 may be appointed by the court upon a filing of an ex
12 parte motion by one of the parties entitled to file a
13 parentage action. Probate requirements need not be
14 met. Appointment of a personal representative in this
15 section shall be limited to representation in
16 proceedings under this chapter.
17 (b) When an action is brought under this section, process

2 complaint submitted by an individual who gave birth to a child,
3 an alleged genetic parent of the child, a presumed parent of the
4 child, or a functional parent of the child with proof provided
5 by affidavit.
6 If, at any stage of the proceedings, there appears probable
7 cause to believe that the individual whose parentage of the
8 child is to be adjudicated will fail to appear in response to
9 the summons or will flee the jurisdiction of the court, the
10 court may issue a warrant directed to the sheriff, deputy
11 sheriff, or any police officer within the circuit, requiring the
12 individual to be arrested and brought for pretrial proceedings
13 before the family court. Upon the pretrial proceedings, the
14 court may require the individual to enter into bond with good
15 sureties to the State in a sum to be fixed by the court for each
16 individual's appearance and the trial of the proceeding in the
17 family court. If the individual whose parentage of the child is
18 to be adjudicated fails to give the bond required, the court may
19 immediately commit that individual to the custody of the chief
20 of police of the county, there to remain until that individual
21 enters into the required bond or otherwise is discharged by due

5 the trial of, or other proceedings in, the action shall proceed
6 as though that individual were present, and the court shall make

10 collected upon the forfeiture shall be applied in payment of the
11 judgment against the individual if they are adjudicated to be a
12 parent under this chapter.

14 agreement approved by the court in accordance with
15 section -502 (a) (2), between a parent and the individual whose
16 parentage of the child is to be adjudicated shall not bar an
17 action under this section.

14 satisfaction, notice of the spouse may be waived and the spouse
15 need not be made a party in the parentage proceedings. The
16 court, after receiving evidence, may also enter a finding of
17 non-parentage of the spouse.

3 PART V. PROCEEDING TO ADJUDICATE PARENTAGE
4 § -501 Pretrial hearings. (a) As soon as practicable
5 after an action to declare the existence or nonexistence of a
6 parent-child relationship has been brought, an informal hearing
7 shall be held. The public shall be barred from the hearing. A
8 record of the proceeding or any portion thereof shall be kept if
9 any party requests, or the court orders. Rules of evidence need
10 not be observed.
11 (b) The court, in its discretion, may waive a hearing on
12 an uncontested parentage complaint submitted by an individual
13 who gave birth to a child, an alleged genetic parent of the
14 child, a presumed parent of the child, or a functional parent of
15 the child with proof provided by affidavit.
16 § -502 Pretrial recommendations. (a) On the basis of
17 the information produced at the pretrial hearing held pursuant
18 to section -501, the judge conducting the hearing shall
19 evaluate the probability of determining the existence or
20 nonexistence of the parent-child relationship in a trial and
21 whether a judicial declaration of the relationship would be in

1 the best interest of the child pursuant to section 571-46 (b) .
2 On the basis of the evaluation, an appropriate recommendation
3 for settlement shall be made to the parties, which may include
4 any of the following:
5 (1) That the action be dismissed with or without
6 prejudice;
7 (2) That the matter be compromised by an agreement among
8 the birth parent and the individual who is seeking to
9 have parentage adjudicated, and the child, in which
10 the individual seeking to be adjudicated to be a
11 parent is not adjudicated to be a parent but in which
12 a defined economic obligation is undertaken in favor
13 of the child and, if appropriate, in favor of the
14 parent, subject to approval by the judge conducting
15 the hearing. In reviewing the obligation undertaken
16 by the individual whose parentage is to be adjudicated
17 in a compromise agreement, the judge conducting the
18 hearing shall consider the best interest of the child,
19 in light of the factors enumerated in section
20 576D-7{a), discounted by the improbability, as it
21 appears to the judge, of establishing the parentage or

4 adjudicated voluntarily acknowledges parentage of the
5 child.
6 (b) If the parties accept a recommendation made in
7 accordance with subsection (a), judgment shall be entered
8 accordingly.
9 (c) If a party refuses to accept the final recommendation
10 made under subsection (a) and genetic tests have not been taken,
11 the court may order the parties to submit to genetic tests, if
12 practicable. Thereafter the judge shall make an appropriate
13 final recommendation. If a party refuses to accept the final
14 recommendation, the action shall be set for trial.
15 (d) A guardian ad litem appointed for the child may accept
16 or refuse to accept a recommendation under this section.
17 (e) The pretrial hearing may be terminated and the action
18 set for trial if the judge conducting the hearing finds it
19 unlikely that all parties would accept a recommendation the
20 judge may make under subsection (a) or (c).

2 shall be a civil action governed by the Hawaii family court
3 rules or the Hawaii rules of civil procedure. The individual
4 who gave birth to the child and the individual whose parentage
5 is to be adjudicated shall be competent to testify and may be
6 compelled to testify; provided that no criminal prosecution,
7 other than a prosecution for perjury, shall afterwards be
8 commenced against the individual who gave birth to the child or
9 the individual whose parentage is to be adjudicated on account
10 of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which they may
11 testify or produce evidence under this chapter, documentary or
12 otherwise. Part VII shall apply in any action brought under
13 this chapter.
14 (b) Testimony relating to sexual access to the individual
15 who gave birth to the child by an unidentified person at any
16 time or by an identified person at a time other than the
17 probable time of conception of the child shall be inadmissible
18 in evidence, unless offered by the individual who gave birth to
19 the child.

1 to an individual who is not subject to the jurisdiction of the
2 court concerning sexual intercourse or assisted reproduction
3 with the individual who gave birth to the child at or about the
4 probable time of conception of the child shall be admissible in
5 evidence only if the individual offering the evidence has
6 undergone and made available to the court genetic tests,
7 including genetic tests the results of which do not exclude the
8 possibility of the individual's parentage of the child.
9 § -504 Judgment or order. (a) The judgment or order of
10 the court determining the existence or nonexistence of the
11 parent-child relationship shall be determinative for all
12 purposes.

14 with the child's birth certificate, the court shall order that a
15 new birth certificate be issued pursuant to section -510.
16 (c) The judgment or order may contain any other provision
17 directed against the appropriate party to the proceeding,
18 concerning the duty of support, the custody and guardianship of
19 the child, visitation privileges with the child, the furnishing
20 of bond or other security for the payment of the judgment, or
21 any other matter in the best interest of the child. Upon

1 neglect or refusal to give this security, or upon default of a
2 parent or a parent's surety in compliance with the terms of the
3 judgment, the court may order the forfeiture of the security and
4 the application of the proceeds thereof toward the payment of
5 any sums due under the terms of the judgment and may also
6 sequester a parent's personal estate, and the rents and profits
7 of a parent's real estate, and may appoint a receiver thereof,
8 and may cause a parent's personal estate, including any
9 salaries, wages, commissions, or other moneys owed to the parent
10 and the rents and profits of the parent's real estate, to be
11 applied toward the meeting of the terms of the judgment, to the
12 extent that the court, from time to time, deems just and
13 reasonable. The judgment or order may direct a parent to .pay
14 the reasonable expenses of the pregnancy and childbirth,
15 including but not limited to medical insurance premiums, such as
16 for MedQuest, that cover the periods of pregnancy and
17 childbirth. The court may further order the noncustodial parent
18 to reimburse the custodial parent, the child, or any public
19 agency for reasonable expenses incurred before entry of
20 judgment, including support, maintenance, education, and funeral
21 expenses expended for the benefit of the child.

1 (d) Support judgments or orders ordinarily shall be for
2 periodic payments that may vary in amount. In the best interest
3 of the child, a lump sum payment or the purchase of an annuity
4 may be ordered in lieu of periodic payments of support. The
5 court may limit the obligor parent's liability for past support
6 of the child to the proportion of the expenses already incurred
7 that the court deems just.
8 (e) In determining the amount to be paid by a parent for
9 support of the child and the period during which the duty of
10 support is owed, a court enforcing the obligation of support
11 shall use the guidelines established under section 576D-7.
12 Provision may be made for the support, maintenance, and
13 education of an adult or minor child and an incompetent adult
14 child, regardless of whether the petition is made before or
15 after the child has attained the age of majority.
16 (f) Whenever a parent of a child is a minor, unmarried,
17 and not able to provide full support, the court may order one or
18 both parents of the minor to support the child until the minor
19 reaches the age of majority, is otherwise emancipated, or is
20 financially able to fully support the child, whichever occurs
21 first. For the purposes of this subsection:

5 of the parent or parents of the minor shall be
6 considered under subsection (d) in determining the
7 amount of support; and
8 (3) The parent or parents of the minor shall be an obligor
9 under this chapter and chapter 571 and any action
10 against the obligor to collect support may be pursued
11 against the parent or parents of the minor.

5 individual has furnished or is furnishing these expenses.
6 (b) The court may order support payments to be made to a
7 parent or an adult child, or through the child support
8 enforcement agency as its rules permit, or through an
9 individual, corporation, or agency designated to administer
10 support payments for the benefit of the child under the
11 supervision of the court.
12 (c) Wilful failure to obey the judgment or order of the
13 court shall be a civil contempt of the court. All remedies for

6 evidence under this subsection shall clearly state that the
7 failure to comply with the order of civil contempt of court may
8 subject the parent to a penalty that may include imprisonment
9 or, if imprisonment is immediately ordered, the conditions that
10 must be met for release from imprisonment. A party may also
11 prove civil contempt of court by means other than prima facie
12 evidence under this subsection.
13 § -507 Modification of judgfment or order. (a) The
14 court shall have continuing jurisdiction to modify or revoke a
15 judgment or order;
16 (1) For future education and support; and

6 the adult child's nineteenth birthday, shall send notice by
7 regular mail to the adult child and the custodial parent that
8 prospective child support will be suspended unless proof is
9 provided by the custodial parent or adult child, to the child
10 support enforcement agency, before the child's nineteenth
11 birthday, that the child is presently enrolled as a full-time
12 student in school or has been accepted into and plans to attend
13 a post-high school university, college, or vocational school as
14 a full-time student for the next semester. If the custodial
15 parent or adult child fails to do so, prospective child support
16 payments may be automatically suspended by the child support
17 enforcement agency, hearings officer, or court. In addition, if
18 applicable, the child support enforcement agency, hearings

4 sample or a combination of samples of blood, buccal cells, bone,
5 hair, or other body tissue or fluid. The specimen used in the
6 testing need not be of the same kind for each individual
7 undergoing genetic testing.
8 (c) Based on the ethnic or racial group of an individual
9 undergoing genetic testing, a testing laboratory shall determine
10 the databases from which to select frequencies for use in
11 calculating a relationship index. If an individual or the child
12 support enforcement agency objects to the laboratory's choice,
13 the following rules shall apply:
14 (1) No later than thirty days after receipt of the report
15 of the test, the objecting individual or the child

5 the laboratory for the ethnic or racial group
6 requested, provide the requested frequencies
7 compiled in a manner recognized by accrediting
8 bodies; or
9 (B) Engage another laboratory to perform the
10 calculations; and
11 (3) The laboratory may use its own statistical estimate if
12 there is a question as to which ethnic or racial group
13 is appropriate. The laboratory shall calculate the
14 frequencies using statistics, if available, for any
15 other ethnic or racial group requested.
16 (d) If, after recalculation of the relationship index
17 under subsection (c) using a different ethnic or racial group,
18 genetic testing under section -705 does not identify an
19 individual as a genetic parent of a child, the court may require
20 an individual who has been tested to submit to additional
21 genetic testing to identify a genetic parent.

14 individual to submit to further genetic testing to identify a
15 genetic parent.
16 (d) If an original test result is contested, the court
17 shall order further genetic testing with payment of the testing
18 to be advanced and paid for by the contesting party.

8 child; provided that if an individual dies or becomes
9 incapacitated before the child attains two years of
10 age or the child dies before the child attains two
11 years of age, the court may find consent under this

8 child conceived by assisted reproduction is terminated through
9 divorce or dissolution, subject to legal separation or separate
10 maintenance, declared invalid, or annulled before transfer of
11 gametes or embryos to said individual, a former spouse of said
12 individual is not a parent of the child unless the former spouse
13 consented in a record that the former spouse would be a parent
14 of the child if assisted reproduction were to occur after a
15 divorce, dissolution, legal separation, separate maintenance,

6 (b) An individual who withdraws consent under subsection
7 (a) is not a parent of the child under this part.
8 § -808 Parental status of deceased individual. (a) If
9 an individual who intends to be a parent of a child conceived by
10 assisted reproduction dies during the period between the
11 transfer of a gamete or embryo and the birth of the child, the
12 individual's death shall not preclude the establishment of the
13 individual's parentage of the child if the individual otherwise
14 would be a parent of the child under this chapter.
15 (b) If an individual who consented in a record to assisted
16 reproduction by an individual who agreed to give birth to a
