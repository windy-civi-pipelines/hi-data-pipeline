SB203 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 203 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO CRIME. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature acknowledges the harmful effects of illegal gambling and drug activities in communities across the State.

Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish a special intergovernmental task force to eradicate illegal gambling and drug activities and to establish community safe zones across the State. SECTION 2. (a)  There is established within the department of the attorney general for administrative purposes a special intergovernmental task force to eradicate illegal gambling and drug activities.
