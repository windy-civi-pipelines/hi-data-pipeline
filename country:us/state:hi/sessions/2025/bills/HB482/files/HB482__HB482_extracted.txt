Section 1:
HB482 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 482 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT Relating to ILLEGAL CAMPING. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that unauthorized camping and habitation on public beaches and properties adversely affect public access, environmental quality, and the safety and well‑being of all residents and visitors. The legislature further finds that the United States Supreme Court decision in Grants Pass v.

Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Enforce existing prohibitions on unlawful camping; (2)  Enhance enforcement mechanisms; and (3)  Provide supportive services to individuals experiencing homelessness. SECTION 2.  Chapter 171, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§171- Homeless encampments on public land; report.  The department, in coordination with appropriate county agencies, shall: (1)  Identify and restore vacated homeless encampment areas on public lands in the State; and (2)  Beginning with the 2026 regular session, submit an annual report to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular session, detailing: (A)  The parcels of public land that were identified and restored during the reporting year; and (B)  The appropriation amount expended for restorations pursuant to this section." SECTION 3.  Section 708-814.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "[[]§708-814.5[]]  Criminal trespass onto public parks and recreational grounds.  (1)  A person commits the offense of criminal trespass onto public parks and recreational grounds if the person remains unlawfully in or upon a public park or recreational ground after a request to leave is made by any law enforcement officer, when the request is based upon violation by the person of any term of use specified on a sign or notice posted on the property, or based on violation of any term of use contained in, or the expiration of, any permit relating to the person's presence on the property. (2)  For the purposes of this section, unless the context requires otherwise: "Law enforcement officer" has the same meaning as in section 710-1000.

(4)  Abandoned or unattended personal property of any person unlawfully left in or upon a public park or recreational ground may be seized and disposed of as provided by law; provided that articles or instruments posing immediate health or safety risks shall be seized and immediately disposed of."
