If no advisory opinion is rendered within ninety days after the request is filed with the commission, it shall be deemed that an advisory opinion was rendered and that the facts and circumstances of that particular case do not constitute a violation of this chapter. The opinion rendered or deemed rendered, until amended or revoked, shall be binding on the commission in any subsequent charges concerning the person subject to this chapter who sought the opinion and acted in reliance on it in good faith, unless material facts were omitted or misstated by the person in the request for an advisory opinion.  The commission shall also render public general advisory opinions concerning proper interpretations of the laws of this chapter and other laws or rules administered and enforced by the commission, if it deems the opinion of sufficient general interest and importance; (5)  Issue subpoenas, administer oaths, require the production for examination of any records or papers relative to any matter under investigation or in question before the commission, and exercise those powers conferred upon the commission by section 92-16; (6)  Adopt, amend, and repeal rules, not inconsistent with this chapter, that in the judgment of the commission seem appropriate for the carrying out of this chapter and for the efficient administration of this chapter, including every matter or thing required to be done or that may be done with the approval or consent or by order or under the direction or supervision of, or as prescribed by, the commission.  The rules, when adopted as provided in chapter 91, shall have the force and effect of law; (7)  Have jurisdiction for purposes of investigation and taking appropriate action on possible violations of this chapter in all proceedings commenced within six years of a possible violation of this chapter.  A proceeding shall be deemed commenced by the filing of a charge with the commission or by the signing of a charge by three or more members of the commission.  Nothing shall bar proceedings against a person who by fraud or other device prevents discovery of a violation of this chapter; and (8)  Distribute educational and advisory publications and initiate, administer, and maintain training programs for the purpose of training lobbyists on compliance with state lobbying laws and applicable parts of the code of ethics.

If the informal advisory opinion indicates a probable violation, the person charged shall request a formal opinion or within a reasonable time comply with the informal advisory opinion. If the person charged fails to comply with the informal advisory opinion or if a majority of the members of the commission determine that there is probable cause for belief that a violation of this chapter might have occurred, a copy of the charge and a further statement of the alleged violation shall be personally served upon the alleged violator. Service shall be made by personal service upon the alleged violator wherever found or by registered or certified mail with request for a return receipt and marked deliver to addressee only.

The commission's decision shall be binding upon the court for purposes of a finding pursuant to section 607-14.5. (f)  The commission shall cause to be published yearly summaries of decisions, advisory opinions, and informal advisory opinions.  The commission shall make sufficient deletions in the summaries to prevent disclosing the identity of persons involved in the decisions or opinions where the identity of such persons is not otherwise a matter of public record under this chapter. (g)  Notwithstanding the above procedures, for any violation of this chapter with a proposed administrative penalty of less than $1,000, the state ethics commission may issue a notice and order of administrative fine describing the violation and assessing an administrative fine.  The order shall become final on the twentieth day after it is served upon the alleged violator, unless the alleged violator submits a written request for a hearing before the state ethics commission on or before the twentieth day.  After conducting a hearing pursuant to chapter 91, the state ethics commission may affirm, modify, or rescind the order as appropriate.  The state ethics commission may file with the circuit court of the first circuit any order the commission has issued pursuant to this section for the purpose of confirming the order as a final judgment that shall have the same force and effect and shall be enforceable and collectable as other judgments issued by the circuit courts; provided that there shall be no appeal from the judgment."
