HB730 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 730 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT rELATING TO EDUCATION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that complying with and upholding state and federal civil rights laws is an important responsibility of the department of education. The legislature further finds that following the December 6, 2018, federal lawsuit filed against the department of education and the Oahu Interscholastic Association involving Campbell high school, the civil rights compliance branch of the department of education received temporary funding to hire a Title IX specialist for gender equity in athletics.  While the incumbent Title IX specialist for gender equity in athletics has already made a statewide impact with the addition of flag football for female athletes, meeting with athletic leagues statewide, garnering support from various stakeholders in the community, and playing a pivotal role in implementing the department of education's gender equity plan statewide, this position is temporary. Furthermore, the legislature finds that additional staff and funding are needed for the department of education to better comply with and uphold state and federal civil rights laws. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish and appropriate funds for five full-time equivalent (5.0 FTE) positions within the civil rights compliance branch of the department of education.
