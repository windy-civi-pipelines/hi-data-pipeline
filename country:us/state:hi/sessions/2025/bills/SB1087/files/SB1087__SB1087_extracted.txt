Section 1:
SB1087 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1087 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO AN AIRPORTS CORPORATION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the well-being of the State is substantially dependent on the efficient administration, development, management, and operation of its airports and air transportation infrastructure.  The legislature further finds that responsibility for Hawaii's airport planning, management, marketing, and capital development functions is currently distributed among a number of agencies, including the department of transportation's airports division; Hawaii tourism authority; department of budget and finance; department of human resources development; board of land and natural resources; department of health, with respect to environmental concerns; and office of Hawaiian affairs, with respect to ceded land issues; among others.  Distributed responsibility and involvement by multiple agencies, which sometimes have conflicting goals and priorities, results in inefficiency, delayed decision-making, and reduced effectiveness.  The legislature believes that coordinated planning and development of the State's air transportation system and infrastructure will be achieved more effectively by establishing and giving a separate state entity overall jurisdiction and responsibility for aeronautics and the State's airports. The legislature further finds that the establishment of a separate airports corporation will assist in the achievement of the following important statewide objectives: (1)  Maximizing the contribution of the State's airports to Hawaii's economy; (2)  Ensuring dedicated expert airport leadership, management continuity, and year-round decision-making, consistent with industry best practices; (3)  Improving administrative efficiency by streamlining administrative processes; (4)  Accelerating the planning and implementation of the state airports' capital improvement programs; (5)  Increasing the financial flexibility and strength of the State's airports; (6)  Increasing economic opportunities for the State, in collaboration with the Hawaii tourism authority; (7)  Increasing responsiveness to consumer needs, commercial opportunities, and economic demands; and (8)  Maximizing job creation within the State. In addition, the management and administration of scarce and increasingly valuable airport resources is most effectively served by a separate airports corporation. The purpose of this Act is to establish the Hawaii airports corporation, which shall assume all of the authority, powers, functions, duties, and responsibilities of the department of transportation related to aeronautics and airports, including responsibility for the development, management, operation, and maintenance of the State's airports, on and after the transfer completion date announced by the Hawaii airports corporation pursuant to section 18(b) of this Act.

In setting airports rates and charges, including landing fees, the [director] chief executive officer may enter into contracts, leases, licenses, and other agreements with aeronautical users of the statewide system of airports containing such terms, conditions, and provisions as the [director] chief executive officer deems advisable. If the [director] chief executive officer has not entered into contracts, leases, licenses, and other agreements with any or fewer than all of the aeronautical users of the statewide system of airports prior to the expiration of an existing contract, lease, license, or agreement, the [director] chief executive officer shall set and impose rates, rentals, fees, and charges pursuant to this subsection without regard to the requirements of chapter 91; provided that a public informational hearing shall be held on the rates, rentals, fees, and charges. The [director] chief executive officer shall develop rates, rentals, fees, and charges in accordance with a residual methodology so that the statewide system of airports shall be, and always remain, self-sustaining.  The rates, rentals, fees, and charges shall be set at [such] levels as to produce revenues [which,] that, together with aviation fuel taxes, shall be at least sufficient to meet the expenditures of the statewide system of airports set forth in section 261-5(a), including expenditures for capital improvement projects approved by the legislature, and to comply with covenants and agreements with holders of airport revenue bonds. The [director] chief executive officer may develop and formulate methodology in setting the various rates, rentals, fees, and charges imposed and may determine usage of space, estimate landed weights, and apply [such] the portion of nonaeronautical revenue deemed appropriate in determining the rates, rentals, fees, and charges applicable to aeronautical users of the statewide system of airports. The rates, rentals, fees, and charges determined by the [director] chief executive officer in the manner set forth in this subsection shall be those charges payable by the aeronautical users for the periods immediately following the date of expiration of the existing contract, lease, license, or agreement.  If fees are established pursuant to this section, the [department] corporation shall prepare a detailed report on the circumstances and rates and charges that have been established, and shall submit the report to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the next regular session. If a schedule of rates, rentals, fees, and charges developed by the [director] chief executive officer in accordance with this section is projected by the [department] corporation to produce revenues [which,] that, together with aviation fuel taxes, will be in excess of the amount required to meet the expenditures of the statewide system of airports set forth in section 261-5(a), including expenditures for capital improvement projects approved by the legislature, and to comply with covenants and agreements with holders of airport revenue bonds, the [department] corporation shall submit the schedule of rates, rentals, fees, and charges to the legislature prior to the convening of the next regular session of the legislature.  Within forty-five days after the convening of the regular session, the legislature may disapprove any schedule of rates, rentals, fees, and charges required to be submitted to it by this section by concurrent resolution.  If no action is taken by the legislature within the forty-five-day period the schedule of rates, rentals, fees, and charges shall be deemed approved.  If the legislature disapproves the schedule within the forty-five-day period, the [director] chief executive officer shall develop a new schedule of rates, rentals, fees, and charges in accordance with this section within seventy-five days of the disapproval.  Pending the development of a new schedule of rates, rentals, fees, and charges, the schedule submitted to the legislature shall remain in force and effect. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the [department] corporation may waive landing fees and other aircraft charges established under this section at any airport owned or controlled by the State whenever: (1)  The governor declares a state of emergency; and (2)  The [department] corporation determines that the waiver of landing fees and other charges for the aircraft is consistent with assisting in the delivery of humanitarian relief to disaster-stricken areas of the State." SECTION 15. Section 262-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding two new definitions to be appropriately inserted and to read as follows: ""Chief executive officer" means the chief executive officer of the Hawaii airports corporation. "Corporation" means the Hawaii airports corporation." SECTION 16.  On and after the transfer completion date established by the Hawaii airports corporation in section 18(b) of this Act, and until the revisor of statutes makes the amendments to applicable provisions in chapters 102, 261, 261D, and 262, Hawaii Revised Statutes, described in this section, every reference to the department of transportation or "department" or its role in awarding concessions in chapters 102, 261, 261D, and 262, Hawaii Revised Statutes, shall be a reference to the Hawaii airports corporation, and every reference to the director of transportation or "director" or the director's role in awarding concessions in chapters 102, 261, 261D, and 262, Hawaii Revised Statutes, shall be a reference to the chief executive officer of the Hawaii airports corporation.  After the transfer completion date but no later than when the subsequent supplements to the Hawaii Revised Statutes are prepared, the revisor of statutes shall make appropriate changes, including, without limitation: (1)  Substituting the term "chief executive officer" for the terms "director" or "director of transportation", the term "Hawaii airports corporation" for the term "department of transportation", and the term "corporation" for the term "department"; (2)  Deleting the definition of "director", in chapters 261 and 262, Hawaii Revised Statutes; and (3)  Deleting the definition of "department" in sections 261-1 and 262-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes.

Raw Text:
SB1087 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1087 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO AN AIRPORTS CORPORATION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the well-being of the State is substantially dependent on the efficient administration, development, management, and operation of its airports and air transportation infrastructure.  The legislature further finds that responsibility for Hawaii's airport planning, management, marketing, and capital development functions is currently distributed among a number of agencies, including the department of transportation's airports division; Hawaii tourism authority; department of budget and finance; department of human resources development; board of land and natural resources; department of health, with respect to environmental concerns; and office of Hawaiian affairs, with respect to ceded land issues; among others.  Distributed responsibility and involvement by multiple agencies, which sometimes have conflicting goals and priorities, results in inefficiency, delayed decision-making, and reduced effectiveness.  The legislature believes that coordinated planning and development of the State's air transportation system and infrastructure will be achieved more effectively by establishing and giving a separate state entity overall jurisdiction and responsibility for aeronautics and the State's airports. The legislature further finds that the establishment of a separate airports corporation will assist in the achievement of the following important statewide objectives: (1)  Maximizing the contribution of the State's airports to Hawaii's economy; (2)  Ensuring dedicated expert airport leadership, management continuity, and year-round decision-making, consistent with industry best practices; (3)  Improving administrative efficiency by streamlining administrative processes; (4)  Accelerating the planning and implementation of the state airports' capital improvement programs; (5)  Increasing the financial flexibility and strength of the State's airports; (6)  Increasing economic opportunities for the State, in collaboration with the Hawaii tourism authority; (7)  Increasing responsiveness to consumer needs, commercial opportunities, and economic demands; and (8)  Maximizing job creation within the State. In addition, the management and administration of scarce and increasingly valuable airport resources is most effectively served by a separate airports corporation. The purpose of this Act is to establish the Hawaii airports corporation, which shall assume all of the authority, powers, functions, duties, and responsibilities of the department of transportation related to aeronautics and airports, including responsibility for the development, management, operation, and maintenance of the State's airports, on and after the transfer completion date announced by the Hawaii airports corporation pursuant to section 18(b) of this Act.

"Airport revenue" means all moneys paid into the airport revenue fund pursuant to section 261-5(a). "Airports corporation" or "corporation" means the Hawaii airports corporation established by this chapter.

In setting airports rates and charges, including landing fees, the [director] chief executive officer may enter into contracts, leases, licenses, and other agreements with aeronautical users of the statewide system of airports containing such terms, conditions, and provisions as the [director] chief executive officer deems advisable. If the [director] chief executive officer has not entered into contracts, leases, licenses, and other agreements with any or fewer than all of the aeronautical users of the statewide system of airports prior to the expiration of an existing contract, lease, license, or agreement, the [director] chief executive officer shall set and impose rates, rentals, fees, and charges pursuant to this subsection without regard to the requirements of chapter 91; provided that a public informational hearing shall be held on the rates, rentals, fees, and charges. The [director] chief executive officer shall develop rates, rentals, fees, and charges in accordance with a residual methodology so that the statewide system of airports shall be, and always remain, self-sustaining.  The rates, rentals, fees, and charges shall be set at [such] levels as to produce revenues [which,] that, together with aviation fuel taxes, shall be at least sufficient to meet the expenditures of the statewide system of airports set forth in section 261-5(a), including expenditures for capital improvement projects approved by the legislature, and to comply with covenants and agreements with holders of airport revenue bonds. The [director] chief executive officer may develop and formulate methodology in setting the various rates, rentals, fees, and charges imposed and may determine usage of space, estimate landed weights, and apply [such] the portion of nonaeronautical revenue deemed appropriate in determining the rates, rentals, fees, and charges applicable to aeronautical users of the statewide system of airports. The rates, rentals, fees, and charges determined by the [director] chief executive officer in the manner set forth in this subsection shall be those charges payable by the aeronautical users for the periods immediately following the date of expiration of the existing contract, lease, license, or agreement.  If fees are established pursuant to this section, the [department] corporation shall prepare a detailed report on the circumstances and rates and charges that have been established, and shall submit the report to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the next regular session. If a schedule of rates, rentals, fees, and charges developed by the [director] chief executive officer in accordance with this section is projected by the [department] corporation to produce revenues [which,] that, together with aviation fuel taxes, will be in excess of the amount required to meet the expenditures of the statewide system of airports set forth in section 261-5(a), including expenditures for capital improvement projects approved by the legislature, and to comply with covenants and agreements with holders of airport revenue bonds, the [department] corporation shall submit the schedule of rates, rentals, fees, and charges to the legislature prior to the convening of the next regular session of the legislature.  Within forty-five days after the convening of the regular session, the legislature may disapprove any schedule of rates, rentals, fees, and charges required to be submitted to it by this section by concurrent resolution.  If no action is taken by the legislature within the forty-five-day period the schedule of rates, rentals, fees, and charges shall be deemed approved.  If the legislature disapproves the schedule within the forty-five-day period, the [director] chief executive officer shall develop a new schedule of rates, rentals, fees, and charges in accordance with this section within seventy-five days of the disapproval.  Pending the development of a new schedule of rates, rentals, fees, and charges, the schedule submitted to the legislature shall remain in force and effect. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the [department] corporation may waive landing fees and other aircraft charges established under this section at any airport owned or controlled by the State whenever: (1)  The governor declares a state of emergency; and (2)  The [department] corporation determines that the waiver of landing fees and other charges for the aircraft is consistent with assisting in the delivery of humanitarian relief to disaster-stricken areas of the State." SECTION 15.

The sums appropriated shall be expended by the Hawaii airports corporation to implement the provisions of this Act. SECTION 27.  If any provision of this Act, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the Act that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this Act are severable.
