THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO SCHOOL IMPACT FEES.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that school impact fees
2 add to the cost of residential housing development, potentially
3 adding thousands of dollars to each new unit of housing
4 constructed in affected districts. These costs are passed on to
5 renters and buyers, leading to higher rental and for-sale
6 prices. In some cases, high impact fees can result in a project
7 becoming financially untenable and the units are never built.
8 This contributes to a scarce housing market, driving up the
9 market price of housing.
10 The legislature further finds that auditor report no. 19-13
11 is the most comprehensive analysis of school impact fees to
12 date. The report's summary of findings are as follows:
13 (1) The department of education's designation of school
14 impact districts lacks well-defined policies and
15 procedures and the district boundaries designated to
16 date raise concerns as to whether constitutional
17 "nexus" requirements have been adequately addressed;

iiHiiiiuniiiiiiiiiiBiiig
H.B. NO.
C.D. 1
1 (2) The department of education's calculation of fees has
2 been inconsistent and at times based on questionable
3 assumptions, and updates to formula factors as well as
4 other requirements of the school impact fee law have
5 not been met;
6 (3) Gaps, that is delays, between designation of school
7 impact districts and collection of fees have resulted
8 in loss of fee revenue; and
9 (4) The department of education cannot adequately account
10 for fair share and school impact fee cash and land
11 contributions.
12 In its report, the auditor also found that in twelve years
13 following the enactment of the school impact fee law, the
14 department of education collected only $5,342,886 in school
15 impact fees. The auditor further found that this collection
16 would not have been enough to build a single elementary school.
17 For example, the auditor found that Hookele elementary school
18 cost $55,000,000 to build and further found that the department
19 estimated it would cost approximately $80,000,000 to build a
20 single new elementary school. The auditor found that none of
21 the school impact fees collected had been used for the
2025-3280 HB422 GDI HMSO

C.D. 1
1 construction of new schools and $17,600,340 of collected fees
2 remain unused in a special fund.
3 The legislature also finds that as of January 1, 2025,
4 $21,118,831.74 remains unused in a special fund.
5 The legislature further finds that school impact fees are a
6 burden on aspiring homeowners and renters and the collection of
7 these fees does not provide a clear benefit to the community.
8 The purpose of this Act is to reduce the cost of housing
9 by:
10 (1) Eliminating the construction cost component of the
11 school impact fee;
12 (2) Exempting additional projects from school impact fees,
13 including certain affordable, government, and Hawaiian
14 home lands developments and single-room dwellings;
15 (3) Requiring the school facilities authority to adopt
16 rules governing the collection of impact fees;
17 (4) Increasing the minimum number of units in a
18 development to trigger land dedication provisions of
19 the land component impact fee; and

4 SECTION 2. Section 302A-1601, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
5 amended to read as follows:
6 "§302A-1601 Findings. New residential developments within
7 identified school impact districts create additional demand for
8 public school facilities. As such, once school impact districts
9 are identified, new residential developments shall be required
10 to contribute toward the construction of new or expansion of
11 existing public school facilities through
12 -HH- The] the land requirement, either through an in lieu

3 fair-share principles [and the net capital coot of ochool
4 facilities,—cxcl-ud-ing land costs-/—that io conoiotcnt w-i-t-h
5 proportionate fair-share principlco].
6 The State determines that new residential developments
7 within designated school impact districts shall provide land for
8 schools or pay a fee in lieu of land proportionate to the
9 impacts of the new residential development on existing school
10 facilities. [The-S-tafee-also dotormine&-that now rcsidcnti-alr

14 In determining the amounts of land component impact fees
15 [and oonotruetion eeot component impact-£o-e&] , the intent of the
16 school impact fee calculations is that new residential
17 developments should not be charged for a higher level of service
18 than is being charged to existing developments.
19 This subpart establishes the methodology for developers to
20 provide their proportionate share of the land [and the
21 construction—east of] needed for new or expanded school

This is to inform you that on July 2, 2025, the following bill was signed into law;
H.B. NO. 422, H.D. 1, RELATING TO SCHOOL IMPACT FEES.
S.D. 2, C.D. 1 ACT 268

THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO SCHOOL IMPACT FEES.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that school impact fees
2 add to the cost of residential housing development, potentially
3 adding thousands of dollars to each new unit of housing
4 constructed in affected districts. These costs are passed on to
5 renters and buyers, leading to higher rental and for-sale
6 prices. In some cases, high impact fees can result in a project
7 becoming financially untenable and the units are never built.
8 This contributes to a scarce housing market, driving up the
9 market price of housing.
10 The legislature further finds that auditor report no. 19-13
11 is the most comprehensive analysis of school impact fees to
12 date. The report's summary of findings are as follows:
13 (1) The department of education's designation of school
14 impact districts lacks well-defined policies and
15 procedures and the district boundaries designated to
16 date raise concerns as to whether constitutional
17 "nexus" requirements have been adequately addressed;
2025-3280 HB422 GDI HMSO
iiHiiiiuniiiiiiiiiiBiiig

H.B. NO.
C.D. 1
1 (2) The department of education's calculation of fees has
2 been inconsistent and at times based on questionable
3 assumptions, and updates to formula factors as well as
4 other requirements of the school impact fee law have
5 not been met;
6 (3) Gaps, that is delays, between designation of school
7 impact districts and collection of fees have resulted
8 in loss of fee revenue; and
9 (4) The department of education cannot adequately account
10 for fair share and school impact fee cash and land
11 contributions.
12 In its report, the auditor also found that in twelve years
13 following the enactment of the school impact fee law, the
14 department of education collected only $5,342,886 in school
15 impact fees. The auditor further found that this collection
16 would not have been enough to build a single elementary school.
17 For example, the auditor found that Hookele elementary school
18 cost $55,000,000 to build and further found that the department
19 estimated it would cost approximately $80,000,000 to build a
20 single new elementary school. The auditor found that none of
21 the school impact fees collected had been used for the
2025-3280 HB422 GDI HMSO

H.B. NO. - ’
C.D. 1
1 construction of new schools and $17,600,340 of collected fees
2 remain unused in a special fund.
3 The legislature also finds that as of January 1, 2025,
4 $21,118,831.74 remains unused in a special fund.
5 The legislature further finds that school impact fees are a
6 burden on aspiring homeowners and renters and the collection of
7 these fees does not provide a clear benefit to the community.
8 The purpose of this Act is to reduce the cost of housing
9 by:
10 (1) Eliminating the construction cost component of the
11 school impact fee;
12 (2) Exempting additional projects from school impact fees,
13 including certain affordable, government, and Hawaiian
14 home lands developments and single-room dwellings;
