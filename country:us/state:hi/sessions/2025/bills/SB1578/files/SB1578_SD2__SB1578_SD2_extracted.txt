SB1578 SD2 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1578 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that fifty years ago, Act 82, Session Laws of Hawaii 1975, established an educational non‑profit public corporation to administer and operate what is today known as the East-West center. The mission of the East‑West center is to benefit local residents and the State's international partners by strengthening the State's international ties and advancing cooperation across the Pacific.  It has been an invaluable partner that is well suited to continuing to assist the State in building partnerships, expanding economic development and education, and collaborating abroad. The legislature further finds that strong sister-state, sister-school, and similar relationships benefit the State's businesses and economy, improve access to flights and transportation, expand high school and college student educational exchanges, broaden access to Pacific culture and arts, preserve the State's relationships to the places of origin of its immigrant communities, and spur sub-national government collaborations to address common priorities, including the eradication of invasive species, promotion of economic development, advancement of clean energy, and preservation of peace between nations. Further, it is appropriate for the State to explore and take advantage of additional ways that Hawaii can benefit from international partnerships, including generating revenue abroad similar to many other jurisdictions.  For example, hosting facilities abroad for local farmers and retailers to more easily sell Hawaii products in key markets, or investing in projects that generate a return.  This enables direct financial benefit that can create revenue to support Hawaii programs and services without additional expense to local taxpayers. The legislature also finds that international relations between East and West across the Pacific have been rapidly changing.  Additionally, previous generations of the State's key community, business, and government leaders who have carefully fostered and maintained these important relationships are retiring or passing on.  If local residents are going to continue to benefit from the State's international ties, and if Hawaii is going to take advantage of international business and revenue opportunities abroad as so many other jurisdictions currently do, it is critical that the State adjust its engagement strategy, ensure continuity with its sister-state communities and partners, and plan for the future. Therefore, the legislature finds that in celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the legislature's establishment of the East-West center, the State must update its international engagement strategy, and reaffirm its commitment to building and maintaining the international partnerships that have benefitted the State over the years, so they can continue to benefit local residents for generations to come. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Engage local leaders with strong relationships abroad to support the governor and legislature in strengthening international partnerships, by redesignating the Hawaii sister-state committee as the Hawaii sister-state and international partnerships commission; (2)  Enable the East-West center to better help and maintain the State's international relationships, programs, and partnerships; and (3)  Enable the State to more easily generate revenue from international partnerships and investment as other jurisdictions do, where appropriate. SECTION 2.  Chapter 201, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding two new sections to part I to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§201-     East-West center.  (a) The official designation of the East-West center shall be the center for cultural and technical interchange between East and West, Inc. (b)  The qualifying standards and conditions related to the receipt of funds under chapter 42F shall not apply to funds received by the East-West center; provided that if the East-West center contracts with a recipient or provider, then the qualifying standards, conditions, and other provisions of chapter 42F shall apply to the recipient or provider and the contract. (c) To receive state funds, the center for cultural and technical interchange between East and West, Inc. shall: (1)  Be licensed or accredited, in accordance with federal, state, or county statutes, rules, or ordinances, to conduct the activities or provide the services for which state funds are appropriated; (2)  Comply with all applicable federal and state laws prohibiting discrimination against any person on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, creed, sex, age, sexual orientation, or disability; (3)  Agree not to use the funds for entertainment or lobbying activities; (4)  Be incorporated under the laws of the State; (5)  Have bylaws or policies that describe the manner in which the activities or services for which a grant is awarded shall be conducted or provided; (6)  Have been determined and designated to be a tax-exempt organization by the Internal Revenue Service; and (7)  Have a governing board whose members shall have no material conflict of interest and serve without compensation.

SB1578 SD2 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1578 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS.
