SB1578 CD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1578 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 1 C.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the Center for Cultural and Technical Interchange Between East and West Act of 1960, Public Law 86-472, authorized the establishment in Hawaii of a center for cultural and technical interchange between East and West, and Act 82, Session Laws of Hawaii 1975 (Act 82), established an educational non-profit public corporation, the Center for Cultural and Technical Interchange Between East and West, Inc., better known and referred to as the "East-West Center", to administer and operate the center.  Act 82 specifies the purposes of the East-West Center, which include, among other things, the promotion of better relations and understanding between the United States and the nations of the East through the administration and operation of the East-West Center as an educational institution operating in furtherance of the objectives of Public Law 86-472 and the promotion, among the nations of the East and West, of the use of the East-West Center by qualified persons for cooperative study, training, and research in matters of East-West significance, thus leading to better relations and understanding as to such matters. The legislature further finds that the East-West Center has become a pivotal institution in fostering understanding and cooperation between the United States and the nations of Asia and the Pacific.  Hawaii's unique geographical location and multicultural heritage make it an ideal location for promoting international relations, particularly within the Asia-Pacific region.  For over six decades, the East-West Center has significantly contributed to the State's role as a bridge between the East and West, enhancing the State's position in international affairs. The legislature further finds that the East-West center's programs in research, education, and exchange have directly benefited the State's economy, culture, and diplomatic relations.  While the federal government has provided significant funding to the East-West center, this federal support has fluctuated over the years.  The legislature recognizes that the center would benefit from regular, predictable state resources to support the development of programs and initiatives that align with the State's strategic goals in international relations, education, and economic development. The legislature finds that the East-West center has served and continues to serve a public purpose of promoting better relations and understanding between the United States and the nations of the East and that granting authorization to the East‑West center to receive appropriations of state funds exempt from the requirements of chapter 42F, Hawaii Revised Statutes, complies with the public purpose requirement of article VII, section 4, of the Hawaii State Constitution. The legislature further finds that strong sister-state, sister-school, and similar relationships benefit the State's businesses and economy, improve access to flights and transportation, expand high school and college student educational exchanges, broaden access to Pacific culture and arts, preserve the State's relationships to the places of origin of its immigrant communities, and spur sub-national government collaborations to address common priorities, including the eradication of invasive species, promotion of economic development, advancement of clean energy, and preservation of peace between nations. Further, it is appropriate for the State to explore and take advantage of additional ways that Hawaii can benefit from international partnerships, including generating revenue abroad similar to many other jurisdictions.  For example, hosting facilities abroad for local farmers and retailers to more easily sell Hawaii products in key markets, or investing in projects that generate a return, could create revenue to support Hawaii programs and services without additional expense to local taxpayers. The legislature also finds that international relations across the Pacific have been rapidly changing.  Additionally, previous generations of the State's key community, business, and government leaders who have carefully fostered and maintained these important relationships are retiring or passing on.  In order for residents to continue to benefit from the State's international ties, and for Hawaii to take advantage of international business and revenue opportunities abroad, as so many other jurisdictions currently do, it is critical that the State adjust its engagement strategy, ensure continuity with its sister-state communities and partners, and plan for the future. Therefore, the legislature finds that in celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the East-West center, the State must update its international engagement strategy and reaffirm its commitment to building and maintaining the international partnerships that have benefitted the State over the years so they can continue to benefit local residents for generations to come. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Establish the official designation of the East-West center as the center for cultural and technical interchange between East and West, Inc., and exempt state fund appropriations to the East-West center from chapter 42F, Hawaii Revised Statutes; (2)  Rename the Hawaii sister-state committee as the Hawaii sister-state and international partnerships commission and amends its functions and membership; (3)  Require the office of international affairs to provide support to the Hawaii sister-state and international partnerships commission; (4)  Expand the department of business, economic development, and tourism's authority to establish out‑of‑state offices to include out-of-state facilities to support sister-state or province partnerships and other partnerships that promote and enrich the people, cultures, environments, and economies of the State and its international partners, generate revenue for the State, and buy property; and (5)  Appropriate funds. SECTION 2.  Chapter 201, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part I to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§201-    East-West center.  (a) The official designation of the East-West center shall be the center for cultural and technical interchange between East and West, Inc.
