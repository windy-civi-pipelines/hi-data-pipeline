Section 1:
HB308 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 308 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO PARTIAL PUBLIC FINANCING OF ELECTIONS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1. The legislature finds that providing public funds for qualifying candidates has several benefits that support democratic processes and enhance the integrity of elections.  Under Hawaii's partial public financing program, the overall cost of elections can be controlled, discouraging excessive spending that leads to campaign "arms races" and mitigating financial inequality among candidates. Offering public financing for elections promotes fair competition by enabling candidates with limited personal wealth or access to large donors to run viable campaigns.  With financial barriers reduced, more candidates can run for office, providing voters with a broader, more diverse range of choices and fostering a healthier democratic environment. Public financing programs amplify the voices of everyday citizens over large-scale donors by prioritizing voter engagement.  To receive matching contributions in Hawaii, candidates are required to demonstrate that they have a base of support from small-dollar donors in their constituency.  This requirement ensures candidates are connected to and representative of their communities.  It also helps reduce the undue influence of special interests on policy decisions by limiting or eliminating the need for candidates to rely on large contributions from corporations, political action committees, or wealthy individuals. Candidates who receive public funds must agree to spending caps and restrictions on external funding, fostering a culture of ethical and issue-focused campaigning.  Candidates are also subject to detailed reporting and oversight requirements, which increases transparency and accountability in campaign financing.  Voters can be more confident that candidates in the public financing program run ethical campaigns without hidden agendas. The legislature further finds that allocating public funds or encouraging grassroots contributions is an investment in the democratic system, ensuring it remains accessible and representative of the people.  When elections are seen as fair and equitable, public trust in the democratic process increases, reinforcing the legitimacy of elected officials. The purpose of this Act is to promote a fairer, more equitable, and more representative electoral process by increasing the matching fund payments to candidates in the partial public financing program for excess qualifying contributions. SECTION 2.  Section 11-429, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows: "(b)  A candidate shall obtain the minimum qualifying contribution amount set forth in subsection (a) once for the election period. [(1)] If the candidate obtains the minimum qualifying contribution amount, the candidate [is] shall be eligible to receive: [(A)]  (1) The minimum payment in an amount equal to the minimum qualifying contribution amounts; and [(B)]  (2)  Payments of [$1] $4 for each $1 of qualifying contributions in excess of the minimum qualifying contribution amounts[; and (2)]. A candidate shall have at least one other qualified candidate as an opponent for the primary or general election to receive public funds for that election." SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: Elections; Partial Public Financing; Matching Funds Description: Increases the matching fund payments to candidates in the partial public financing program for excess qualifying contributions.
