BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1. The legislature finds that Act 67, Session Laws of Hawaii 2015, required the department of budget and finance to work with one state department on a pilot project to develop efficiency measures for possible inclusion in various documents that are required to be prepared under part IV of chapter 37, Hawaii Revised Statutes, governing the State's executive budget, and that the university of Hawaii volunteered to participate in the project.

This Act shall be known as the University of Hawaii Efficiency Act of 2025. SECTION 2.  Chapter 304A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to subpart B of part V to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§304A-    General fund appropriations; performance-based outcome funding; report.  (a)  The board of regents may transfer general fund appropriations for the university of Hawaii to other university of Hawaii program IDs in accordance with performance-based outcomes established at the lowest unit of study relating to student achievement and degree attainment and articulation as determined by the president of the university; provided that the president of the university may transfer the funds pursuant to this subsection if the authority is delegated to the president of the university by the board of regents.
