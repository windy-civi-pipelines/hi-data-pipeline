STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO HEALTH.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAH:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the federal 340B
2 drug pricing program (340B program) is essential for providing
3 health care access to low-income and uninsured populations. The
4 340B program requires drug manufacturers to offer significant
5 discounts on outpatient medications to eligible nonprofit
6 hospitals and safety net providers, rural hospitals, community
7 health centers, and Native Hawaiian health centers.
8 The legislature further finds that the 340B program helps
9 stretch limited resources, allowing hospitals to reinvest
10 savings into essential community benefits. These benefits
11 include financial assistance for low-income patients, free
12 wellness visits, screenings, vaccinations, transportation to
13 appointments, health education classes, and workforce
14 development programs. In Hawaii, the 340B program also supports
15 unique services such as integrating Native Hawaiian health
16 practices into patient care.

C.D. 1
1 The legislature also finds that, despite the 340B program's
2 importance, drug manufacturers have consistently tried to
3 undermine the benefits provided by the program by limiting the
4 use of contract pharmacies by 340B covered entities, which has
5 made it particularly difficult for patients living in rural
6 areas of the State. Contract pharmacies play a vital role in
7 ensuring that patients can access medications, especially in
8 rural areas where many hospitals do not have an in-house
9 pharmacy. For example, more than eighty per cent of rural 34OB
10 hospitals nationwide rely on contract pharmacies to dispense
11 medication to patients who might otherwise go without essential
12 treatments.
13 The legislature additionally finds that contract pharmacies
14 are crucial in Hawaii, where geographic barriers make access to
15 health care difficult for many residents. By partnering with
16 pharmacies in those communities, hospitals can ensure that
17 patients in remote areas receive their prescribed medications
18 without the need to travel long distances. This is especially
19 important for those requiring specialty drugs, which are often
20 available only through specific pharmacy channels.

C.D. 1
1 The legislature further finds that the current restrictions
2 imposed by drug manufacturers not only limit a patient's access
3 to affordable medication, but also jeopardize the financial
4 savings that hospitals depend on to provide these critical
5 services. Hospitals use the difference between the 340B
6 discounted drug price and the reimbursement from insurance to
7 reinvest in their operations, expand services, and support
8 underserved communities. Without access to contract pharmacies,
9 hospitals face reduced savings, which could result in cutbacks
10 to essential health care programs.
11 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to preserve the
12 integrity of the 340B drug pricing program by:
13 (1) Prohibiting drug manufacturers from denying,
14 restricting, or prohibiting the acquisition, shipping,
15 or delivery of a 340B drug to a pharmacy under
16 contract with any 340B covered entity in the State;
17 (2) Authorizing 340B covered entities and the attorney
18 general to bring a civil action for enforcement within
19 four years of a violation;

1 (3) Requiring 340B covered entities to report certain
2 information annually to the hospital trade association
3 operating in the State; and
4 (4) Requiring the hospital trade association operating in
5 the State to prepare and publicly post annual reports
6 aggregating information provided by all 34OB covered
7 entities.
8 SECTION 2. The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by
9 adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read
10 as follows:
11 "CHAPTER

13 § -1 Definitions. As used in this chapter:

8 duplicate discounts, or whether a transaction is eligible for a

10 and a third-party payor; provided further that any request for
11 claims data by a manufacturer shall be limited to claims
12 submitted no more than three years prior to the date of the
