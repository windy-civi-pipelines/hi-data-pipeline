BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds electric bicycles are widely available and becoming a more prevalent means of personal transportation.  However, the growing adoption of electric bicycles on public roads, bike paths, and urban environments has introduced new safety concerns, including risks to riders, pedestrians, and other road users, which necessitate clear and comprehensive safety regulations.  Existing traffic and bicycle laws do not adequately address the unique characteristics and risks associated with electric bicycles.  The legislature further finds that electric micro mobility devices are also growing in popularity.  Despite this, existing law is silent as to the regulations of these mobility devices. The legislature believes that ensuring the safety of electric bicycle riders and electric micro mobility devices and the public requires the implementation of updated regulations governing electric bicycles.  Additionally, public awareness of any new regulations for electric bicycles is necessary for compliance with the regulations. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Update and enhance the State's laws relating to electric bicycles; and (2)  Define and regulate electric micro mobility devices. SECTION 2.  Chapter 291C, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding seven new sections to part XIII to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§291C-A Electric bicycles; labeling.
