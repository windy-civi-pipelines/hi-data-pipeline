A bidder who is awarded a contract shall be subject to the following sanctions if, after commencement of work, the bidder at any time during the construction is no longer a party to a registered apprenticeship agreement for each apprenticeable trade the bidder will [employ] utilize to construct the public works: (1)  Temporary or permanent cessation of work on the project, without recourse to breach of contract claims by the bidder; provided that the governmental body shall be entitled to restitution for nonperformance or liquidated damages, as appropriate; or (2)  Proceedings to debar or suspend under section 103D‑702. [(d)] (e)  The purchasing agency shall be entitled to audit and full access to the books and records of a contractor or any subcontractor of a contractor who has been awarded a public works contract utilizing an earned credit pursuant to this section, to the extent that the books and records relate to the contractor's compliance with this section as determined by the chief procurement officer. Accurate and detailed books and records shall be maintained by the contractor for a period of three years from the date of final payment under the prime contract and by the subcontractor for a period of three years from the date of final payment under the subcontract.
