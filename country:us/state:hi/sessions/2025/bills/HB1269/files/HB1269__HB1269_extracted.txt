HB1269 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1269 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to trail accessibility. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that individuals with disabilities face unique challenges when seeking to access and enjoy public lands, state parks, and wilderness areas.  The ability to connect with nature is a fundamental right that fosters physical well-being, mental health, and community inclusion.  Accessible trail programs designed to enhance the experiences of disabled individuals in outdoor recreational areas have proven effective in fostering inclusivity, enriching lives, and promoting equity. Research demonstrates the positive impacts of programs such as the Colorado parks and wildlife system, which offers adaptive equipment and accessible trails through its "track-chair program".  This initiative provides individuals with mobility impairments access to state park trails previously deemed inaccessible.  The program has received widespread acclaim for improving physical and emotional health outcomes among participants and exemplifies a successful partnership between public funding and private sponsorship.  Similarly, the Mount Shasta trail association in California has implemented a series of wheelchair-accessible wilderness trails. These include widened paths, specially designed viewpoints, and signage to cater to a wider range of individuals with disabilities.  These efforts have significantly increased participation rates of individuals with disabilities in wilderness activities and established a model for other states to emulate. The legislature recognizes that the State is renowned for its natural beauty and recreational opportunities and must ensure that its public lands are accessible to all of its residents and visitors.  Establishing an inclusive program to enhance accessibility will provide individuals with disabilities an opportunity to engage with Hawaii's diverse ecosystems while promoting values of equity and sustainability.  Further, by leveraging existing successful models from other states, including these in Colorado and California, the State can ensure its own program will be efficient and effective. It is the legislature's intent that this Act shall serve as a commitment to ensuring that all individuals, regardless of physical ability, have an equal opportunity to experience and benefit from Hawaii's unique natural landscapes. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Establish an accessible wilderness and state parks trails program to enhance outdoor recreational opportunities for individuals with disabilities; (2)  Promote partnerships with public and private organizations to fund and sustain the program, and enshrine the principles of inclusivity, equity, and environmental stewardship in the design and implementation of the program; and (3)  Establish the accessible wilderness and state parks trails program special fund. SECTION 2. Chapter 198D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part     .  Accessible wilderness and state parks TRAILS program §198D-    Definitions. For the purposes of this part: "Accessible trail" means a designated pathway in a wilderness area or state park that is constructed or modified to meet the needs of individuals with disabilities in compliance with applicable federal and state accessibility standards.
