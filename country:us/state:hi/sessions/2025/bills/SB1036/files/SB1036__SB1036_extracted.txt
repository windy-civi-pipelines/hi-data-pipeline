Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to ensure that the provision of broadband internet services is safely and fairly delivered to all users in the State by prohibiting: (1)  Fixed and mobile internet service providers that provide broadband internet access service from engaging in certain actions concerning the treatment of internet traffic; (2)  Among other things, blocking lawful content, applications, services, or nonharmful devices, impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of content or application or service, use of a nonharmful device, and certain practices relating to zero-rating, as defined; and (3)  Fixed and mobile internet service providers from offering or providing services other than broadband internet access services that are delivered over the same last-mile connection as the broadband internet access service if those services have the purpose or effect of evading prohibitions or negatively affect the performance of broadband internet access service. SECTION 2. The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Chapter INTERNET NEUTRALITY §   -1  Definitions.  As used in this chapter: "Application-agnostic" means not differentiating on the basis of source, destination, internet content, application, service, or device, or class or internet content, application, service, or device.

"Class of internet content, application, service, or device" means internet content or a group of internet applications, services, or devices, sharing a common characteristic, including but not limited to sharing the same source or destination, belonging to the same application- or transport-layer protocol, or having similar technical sequencing, or timing of packets, or sensitivity to delay. "Content, applications, or services" means all internet traffic transmitted to or from end users of a broadband internet access service, including but not limited to traffic that may not fit clearly into any of these categories. "Edge provider" means any individual or entity that provides any content, application, or service over the Internet, and any individual or entity that provides a device used for accessing any content, application, or service over the Internet.

(b) It shall be unlawful for a mobile internet service provider, insofar as the provider is engaged in providing mobile broadband internet access service, to engage in any of the activities described in subsection (a). §   -3  Last-mile service provision requirements.  (a)  It shall be unlawful for a fixed internet service provider to offer or provide services other than broadband internet access services that are delivered over the same last-mile connection as the broadband internet access service if those services: (1)  Have the purpose or effect of evading the prohibitions in section -2; or (2)  Negatively affect the performance of broadband internet access service.

(b) Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit reasonable efforts by a fixed or mobile internet service provider to address copyright infringement or other unlawful activity. (c) Notwithstanding any other law, any waiver of the provisions of this chapter shall be contrary to public policy and shall be unenforceable and void." SECTION 3. This Act does not affect rights and duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, and proceedings that were begun before its effective date. SECTION 4. If any provision of this Act, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the Act that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this Act are severable.
