11 improvements in the most dangerous transit corridors.
12 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
13 (1) Establish a safe routes to school program vehicle
14 registration surcharge on certain motor vehicle
15 registrations, to be imposed and collected no later
16 than December 31, 2025;

6 SECTION 2. Chapter 249, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
7 amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated

9 "§249- Safe routes to school program vehicle
10 registration surcharge. (a) In addition to any other fees
11 required by law, each county shall impose and collect a $5
12 surcharge on every motor vehicle registration issued under
13 section 249-31 or 249-31.5, no later than December 31, 2025.
