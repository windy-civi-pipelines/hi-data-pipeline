STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 2
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO DISASTER RECOVERY.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that special controls on
2 developments within an area along the shoreline are necessary to
3 avoid permanent losses of valuable resources and the foreclosure
4 of management options, and to ensure adequate access, by
S dedication or other means, to public owned or used beaches,
6 recreation areas, and natural reserves. The legislature further
7 finds that it is state policy to preserve, protect, and where
8 possible, restore the natural resources of the coastal zones of
9 the State. The legislature further finds that the 2023 Maui
10 wildfires devastated Lahaina's heritage, economy, and sense of
11 place, and has deeply affected housing, businesses, jobs, and
12 treasured resources. If the area is not rebuilt in a
13 deliberate, coordinated, and expeditious manner, the area may
14 languish in the long term, further affecting the well-being of
15 the land, the people, and the economy. However, there is an
16 opportunity to rebuild Lahaina and the other parts of Maui that
17 the wildfires destroyed, as recognized in the Presidential
