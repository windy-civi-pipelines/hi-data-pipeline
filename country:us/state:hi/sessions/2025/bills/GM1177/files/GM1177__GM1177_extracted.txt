BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that unauthorized
2 restaurant reservation listings by third-party restaurant
3 reservation services are misleading to consumers and detrimental
4 to restaurant businesses in the State. The legislature also

6 substantial misconduct. This Act advances the State's interest
7 by prohibiting third parties from listing restaurant reservation
8 services without the restaurant's knowledge or prior written
9 consent. The legislature further finds that avoiding these
10 harmful effects justifies the restrictions imposed by this Act.
11 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
12 (1) Prohibit third-party restaurant reservation services
13 from advertising, listing, promoting, facilitating,
14 enabling, or selling restaurant reservation services
15 without first obtaining a written agreement from the
16 applicable restaurant authorizing the action; and

12 designee of the restaurant expressly authorized by the
13 restaurant to distribute reservations to a third party, agrees
14 in writing for the third-party restaurant reservation service to
15 advertise, list, promote, facilitate, enable, or sell
