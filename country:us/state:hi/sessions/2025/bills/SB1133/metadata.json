Beginning 8/1/2025, requires certain counties to annually calculate and publish the maximum rate at which a landlord may increase the rental price of a dwelling unit during the immediately succeeding twelve-month period.  Establishes a nonrefundable Long-Term Residential Lease Tax Credit for taxpayers who own and lease a dwelling unit located in a county that has adopted a rental unit price ceiling ordinance to a person as the person's principal residence in the State pursuant to a lease agreement of a term of one year or longer.  Allows the tax credit to be carried forward for up to three taxable years.  Applies to taxable years beginning after 12/31/2025.  Effective 7/1/2050.  (SD2)"
