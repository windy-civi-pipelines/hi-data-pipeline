SR115 THE SENATE S.R. NO. 115 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII SENATE RESOLUTION requesting the Hawaii State Energy Office to convene a geothermal energy working group to evaluate the regulatory and policy landscape surrounding geothermal energy in hawaii. WHEREAS, Hawaii has committed to achieving a one hundred percent renewable energy portfolio standard by 2045 under section 269-92, Hawaii Revised Statutes, and has made significant progress in the development of renewable energy resources; and WHEREAS, however, the State remains heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels, creating high energy costs and economic vulnerability and increasing the urgency to accelerate the development of local firm renewable energy resources; and WHEREAS, on January 29, 2025, the Governor issued an executive order that recommits the State to its one hundred percent renewable portfolio standard goal, while setting a new goal to accelerate renewable energy for neighbor island communities and directing state departments to streamline and accelerate permitting to reduce energy costs and project timelines; and WHEREAS, ninety-one percent of respondents in a statewide public opinion survey on energy in Hawaii expressed their support for the expansion of renewable energy resources throughout the State, with the importance of developing Hawaii's own energy resources emphasized by respondents across all counties; and WHEREAS, geothermal energy provides a stable, firm, and dispatchable source of renewable power, capable of supporting grid stability and resilience while reducing dependence on imported oil; and WHEREAS, Hawaii has substantial geothermal potential, particularly on Hawaii Island, and there is growing interest in responsibly developing community-led geothermal resources to contribute to the State's clean energy goals and support community development; and WHEREAS, despite its potential, geothermal energy in Hawaii has been hindered by regulatory uncertainty, permitting challenges, land use restrictions, and public concerns that require careful consideration and engagement; and WHEREAS, a coordinated, transparent, and community-inclusive process is essential to evaluating the role of geothermal energy in Hawaii and identifying a clear development pathway that aligns with state policy, environmental stewardship, and cultural sensitivity; and WHEREAS, the Hawaii State Energy Office is the lead agency for energy policy and planning and is well-positioned to convene stakeholders and provide guidance on challenges and opportunities relevant to geothermal energy technology; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, that the Hawaii State Energy Office is requested to convene a Geothermal Energy Working Group to evaluate the regulatory and policy landscape surrounding geothermal energy in Hawaii; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the working group is requested to consist of the following members: (1)  The Chief Energy Officer, or the Chief Energy Officer's designee, who is requested to serve as chairperson of the working group; (2)  The Chairperson of the Board of Land and Natural Resources, or the Chairperson's designee; (3)  The Director of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism, or the Director's designee; (4)  The Director of Health, or the Director's designee;

(11)  A representative from an electric utility; (12)  A representative from the geothermal industry; (13)  A representative from a non-governmental organization with experience in energy policy; and (14)  Other members, as invited by the chair; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the working group is requested to: (1)  Identify key regulatory, policy, and permitting challenges affecting geothermal energy in Hawaii; (2)  Review best practices from other jurisdictions with successful geothermal energy programs and consider best practices of Pacific island countries such as New Zealand; (3)  Assess the potential for geothermal expansion and its role in supporting energy resilience and affordability; and (4)  Provide recommendations to the Legislature and Governor on policy and regulatory reforms necessary to establish a clear and efficient pathway for geothermal energy in Hawaii; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Hawaii State Energy Office is requested to submit a report of its findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, to the Legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2026;
