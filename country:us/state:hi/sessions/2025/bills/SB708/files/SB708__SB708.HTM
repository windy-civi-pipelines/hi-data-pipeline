Section 1:
SB708 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 708 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to prescriptive authority for clinical psychologists. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii needs more mental health professionals having prescriptive authority to provide the State's residents with access to care.  The State is experiencing a critical shortage of psychiatrists and primary care physicians. This is especially true on the neighbor islands, which experience shortages of psychiatrists of up to seventy-five per cent.  These shortages are leaving significant mental health needs unmet. Untreated or undertreated mental illnesses and substance abuse disorders contribute to chronic homelessness in Hawaii and are factors in approximately sixty per cent of all arrests on the island of Oahu.  Mentally ill persons who receive inadequate or no treatment may also be at higher risk of attempting suicide.  According to the department of health, suicide is the number one cause of death among Hawaii residents between fifteen to twenty-four years of age.  However, when identified and treated, many mental health conditions respond well to therapy and medication. Although clinical psychologists in Hawaii currently lack prescriptive authority, psychologists in other states have been given this privilege.  Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, and New Mexico have authorized prescriptive authority for advanced trained psychologists. The Department of Defense and Indian Health Service also authorize specially trained psychologists to prescribe psychotropic medications.  The American Psychological Association has developed a model curriculum for psychologists to earn a master's degree in psychopharmacology. The legislature recognizes that allowing specially trained psychologists to prescribe certain psychotropic medications would provide more residents with access to needed mental health care. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to authorize and appropriate funds for the board of psychology to grant prescriptive authority to clinical psychologists who meet specific education, training, and registration requirements. SECTION 2.  Chapter 465, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part   .

SECTION 6.  Section 346-59.9, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (h) to read as follows: "(h)  All psychotropic medications covered by this section shall be prescribed by a psychiatrist, a prescribing psychologist with prescriptive authority under part     of chapter 465, a physician, or an advanced practice registered nurse with prescriptive authority under chapter 457 and duly licensed in the State." SECTION 7.  Chapter 465, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by designating sections 465-1 to 465-15 as part I and inserting a title before section 465-1 to read as follows: "PART I.  GENERAL PROVISIONS" SECTION 8.  Section 465-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (e) to read as follows: "(e)  [Nothing] Except as provided in part     , nothing in this chapter shall be construed as permitting the administration or prescription of drugs, or in any way engaging in the practice of medicine as defined in the laws of the State."
