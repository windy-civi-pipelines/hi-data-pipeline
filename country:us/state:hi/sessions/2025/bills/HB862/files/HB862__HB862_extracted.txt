Section 1:
HB862 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 862 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to transportation services. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the availability of school bus services is essential to student attendance.  School bus services are particularly crucial for families who live in rural and remote areas, as well as students who come from socioeconomically disadvantaged communities.  Currently, there is a nationwide shortage of school bus drivers.  This shortage is impacting the State, forcing the suspension or partial suspension of school bus services to central Oahu and east Hawaii island.  In the 2024-2025 school year, a total of one hundred thirty-eight routes were temporarily suspended, affecting nearly three thousand seven hundred twenty students who signed up for bus transportation. The legislature further finds that, to address the shortage of school bus drivers in Hawaii, the governor issued an emergency proclamation in August 2024 to allow the department of transportation to grant exemptions for the use of vehicles other than school buses to transport students.  Specifically, this and subsequent related emergency proclamations allow for the transport of students using vehicles other than school vehicles by drivers possessing a commercial driver's license with an endorsement authorizing the driving of vehicles carrying passengers.  The legislature believes that making this exemption permanent may help alleviate the lack of school bus drivers. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that certain provisions of the governor's August 2024 emergency proclamation on school bus services is placed into statute by authorizing the use of motorcoaches, small buses, and vans for school bus services; provided certain conditions are met. SECTION 2.  Section 286-102, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows: "(b)  A person operating the following category or combination of categories of motor vehicles shall be examined as provided in section 286-108 and duly licensed by the examiner of drivers: (1)  Mopeds; (2)  Motorcycles, except for autocycles as described in paragraph (2) of the definition of "motorcycle" in section 286-2, and motor scooters; (3)  Passenger cars of any gross vehicle weight rating, buses designed to transport fifteen or fewer occupants, trucks and vans having a gross vehicle weight rating of eighteen thousand pounds or less, and autocycles as described in paragraph (2) of the definition of "motorcycle" in section 286-2; and (4)  All of the motor vehicles in category (3) and any vehicle that is not a commercial motor vehicle. A school bus, small bus, motorcoach, or van operator shall be properly licensed to operate the category of vehicles that the operator operates as a school bus, small bus, motorcoach, or van and shall comply with the standards of the department of transportation as provided by rules adopted pursuant to section 286-181." SECTION 3.  Section 286-181, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended as follows: 1. By amending subsections (b) through (e) to read: "(b)  The department of transportation shall grant exemptions for the use of vehicles other than school vehicles, including motorcoaches, small buses, and vans, when the department finds that compliance with this section is: (1)  Impractical due to the unavailability of school vehicles; or (2)  Impractical due to economic factors.
