SECTION 2.  Section 171-11, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§171-11  Public purposes, lands set aside by the governor; management[.]; land surveys; requirements; public land registry; dispute resolution.  (a)  The governor may, with the prior approval of the board of land and natural resources, set aside public lands to any department or agency of the State, the city and county, county, or other political subdivisions of the State for public use or purpose.  All withdrawals of the lands or portions thereof so set aside shall be made by the governor. Any public lands set aside by the governor prior to the enactment of this chapter, or any public lands set aside by the governor of the Territory of Hawaii, shall be subject to the provisions of this section. Lands while so set aside for [such] public use or purpose or when acquired for roads and streets shall be managed by the department, agency, city and county, county, or other political subdivisions of the State having jurisdiction thereof, unless otherwise provided by law.  [Such] The department, agency of the State, the city and county, county, or other political subdivisions of the State in managing [such] these lands shall be authorized to exercise all of the powers vested in the board in regard to the issuance of leases, easements, licenses, revocable permits, concessions, or rights of entry covering [such] the lands for [such] the use as may be consistent with the purposes for which the lands were set aside on the same terms, conditions, and restrictions applicable to the disposition of public lands, as provided by this chapter all [such] dispositions being subject to the prior approval of the board; provided that any nonrenewable dispositions granting rights for a period not in excess of fourteen days shall not require: (1)  [the] The approval of the board; or (2)  [public] Public auction or public advertisement for sealed tenders; [and] provided further that disposition of lands set aside for use as agricultural parks pursuant to chapter 166 shall not be subject to the prior approval of the board.  If at the time of the disposition of any such leases the board shall have approved the same, any order withdrawing or setting aside any or all of such lands for any other public purpose shall be made subject to such leases. Subject to section 5(f) of the Act of March 18, 1959 (73 Stat. 6), all proceeds from such lands shall be deposited into the appropriate funds provided by law. A survey of the land to be set aside shall not be a condition precedent to set aside public lands to a department or agency of the State; provided that a subsequent survey of the land set aside shall be binding if ratified by the board of land and natural resources and the governor; provided further that the State, its departments and agencies, and its officials and employees shall be immune from all suits of whatever character, whether sounding in law or in equity, relating to the boundaries of land set aside without a survey. This section shall also apply where the purposes are the uses and purposes of the United States; provided that all revenues derived from the lands and improvements thereon shall be paid to the department of land and natural resources by the United States.

Whenever portions of lands set aside for a public purpose to the various departments and agencies of the State, or to any city and county, county, or other political subdivision of the State are not presently utilized or required for the public purpose stated, the board shall have the power, without withdrawing the order setting aside the lands, to dispose of any and all real property interest less than the fee in the portions of [such] the lands where the disposition is for a use which is consistent or inconsistent with the purpose for which the land was set aside.  All funds derived from disposition by the board shall be deposited in the general fund of the State or be paid to the appropriate account; provided that all such dispositions shall be with the prior written approval of the department, agency, city and county, county, or other political subdivisions of the State and the governor, and shall be undertaken in compliance with all other applicable sections of this chapter. (b) If a land survey is not completed before the setting aside of public lands, the department may utilize geographic information system map data, existing tax parcel maps, and aerial imagery to define approximate boundaries for administrative purposes; provided that any boundary assessments made according to geographic information systems map data shall be subject to the review and approval of the land survey division of the department of accounting and general services.
