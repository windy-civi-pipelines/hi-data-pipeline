Section 1:
SR71 THE SENATE S.R. NO. 71 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII SENATE RESOLUTION REQUESTING the department of agriculture to establish AND ADMINISTER a microbial algae soil products pilot program. WHEREAS, soil health is a critical element of sustainable crop production, as soil can directly influence biological and microbial activity that supports agricultural systems; and WHEREAS, in the agricultural sector, soil health and quality can be negatively impacted by certain practices, such as the excessive use of chemical fertilizers that deplete essential microbiological nutrients. Soil degradation can be further exacerbated by soil compaction, poor aggregation, high pathogen pressure, and heavy metal contamination, which can lead to reduced crop yields, increased disease susceptibility, and greater reliance on intensive agricultural practices that can further harm the environment; and WHEREAS, to prevent soil degradation, algae-based fertilizers have been proven to protect soil while replenishing key nutrients needed for agricultural activities.  Microbial algae-based fertilizers are rich in organic compounds, nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, and trace elements that improve soil aeration, increase water retention, suppress harmful pathogens, and boost overall agricultural fertility; and WHEREAS, emerging research has demonstrated that specific types of microalgae and seaweeds offer promising solutions to improve soil health as a stimulant for nutrient cycling.  Additionally, microbial algae products do not contain synthetic chemicals, which can harm both natural physical environments and critical water resources; and WHEREAS, the incorporation of microbial algae-based fertilizers is a sustainable and cost-effective solution for the State's agricultural industry; and WHEREAS, the agricultural industry remains a critical state priority.  As the State seeks to increase its food resiliency and self-sufficiency while promoting local produce and agricultural products, ensuring the overall health of soil is imperative to achieve this goal; and WHEREAS, as the agricultural industry continues to innovate methods suited for the State's unique natural environment, recent developments, including microbial algae soil products, can provide low-risk opportunities to test new practices; and WHEREAS, by testing alternative agricultural methods in farms statewide, the agricultural industry can continue to grow while ensuring the safety of local produce and products for consumption; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, that the Department of Agriculture is requested to establish and administer a Microbial Algae Soil Products Pilot Program that introduces microbial algae on agricultural lands in the State to address agricultural soil health while improving nutrient cycling, reducing fertilizer dependency, and enhancing overall soil health; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that farmers are requested to be eligible for participation in the Microbial Algae Soil Products Pilot Program if the farmer: (1)  Operates a small to medium-sized farm of not less than ten acres and not more than one hundred acres; (2)  Has stable or moderate production rates among all crops produced on the farm; (3)  Experiences yield reduction, poor soil health or nutrient management, or excessive fertilizer use that impacts the overall quality of soil; (4)  Produces high-value crops or a diverse variety of crops; and (5)  Operates an organic farm; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of Agriculture may establish additional criteria for eligibility to participate in the Microbial Algae Soil Products Pilot Program; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of Agriculture is requested to collaborate with the College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resiliency of the University of Hawaii and laboratories at the University of Hawaii engaged in the study of soil sciences; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of Agriculture may collaborate with other departments, laboratories, or units at the University of Hawaii whose expertise is relevant to the Microbial Algae Soil Products Pilot Program; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of Agriculture is requested to submit a report of its findings and recommendations for the long-term application of microbial algae soil products to the State's agricultural sector, including any proposed legislation, to the Legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Sessions of 2026 and 2027; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Chairperson of the Board of Agriculture and Dean of the College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resiliency of the University of Hawaii.
