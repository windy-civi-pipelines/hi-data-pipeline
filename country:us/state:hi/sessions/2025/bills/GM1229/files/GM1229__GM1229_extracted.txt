9 affixing, or using any sun screening device in
10 conjunction with the glazing material of a motor
11 vehicle with mirrored or high reflective finishes that
12 produce a red, yellow, amber, or blue appearance;
13 (2) Require all drivers and passengers of motor vehicles
14 with applied tint to fully roll down their windows

6 driver on sedans from sun screening device
7 reguirements;
8 (5) Increase the minimum and maximum fines for violating
9 sun screening device requirements; and
