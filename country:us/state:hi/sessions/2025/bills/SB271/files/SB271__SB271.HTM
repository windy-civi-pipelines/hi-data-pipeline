Section 1:
SB271 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 271 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to statewide composting. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Department of Agriculture, food waste is the second largest component of the waste stream and accounts for twenty‑five per cent of all materials sent to landfills.  Nearly fifty per cent of organic materials disposed of in incinerators and landfills can be diverted for bioconversion, including composting. Landfills across Hawaii are rapidly reaching capacity and are facing closure and re-siting, a process that will cost each county hundreds of millions of dollars and create community resentment. Recycling organics, including food waste, into compost has environmental benefits, such as improving soil health, increasing drought resistance, and reducing the need for supplemental water, fertilizers, and pesticides, while also increasing crop yields and reducing the risk of invasive species introduction to neighboring islands through the importation of contaminated compost.  Furthermore, applying compost and organic matter to soil sequesters carbon from the atmosphere, forming the largest land-based carbon sink, and mitigates climate change by effectively reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The legislature believes that food waste diversion and the creation of multi-scale composting operations across the State will greatly reduce the burdens on landfills, lower county waste management costs, and move the State closer to achieving its sustainability and resiliency goals, which include: (1)  The Aloha+ Challenge, which is a statewide commitment to realize the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, and which sets a goal of seventy per cent waste reduction before disposal, and doubling local food production by 2030; (2)  The Hawaii 2050 sustainability plan, which mandates the State to achieve full sustainability and resilience through increased food production and dramatic waste reduction via recycling and bioconversion strategies; and (3)  Increasing the generation of local compost to sequester more carbon and mitigate climate change pursuant to the strategy identified by the greenhouse gas sequestration task force permanently established by Act 15, Session Laws of Hawaii 2018. The legislature also finds that the regulation of co‑composting in the State is under the purview of the department of health's solid and hazardous waste branch.  Existing rules have not been updated in over twenty years.  Currently, a single application applies to all co-composting operations regardless of size or scope.  The current permitting process is an onerous and unreasonable barrier to lawful participation for small to midsize composting operations whose operations present a much lower risk potential.  Reform and updating of the co-composting rules and permitting process will greatly increase the number of operators diverting organics from landfills and incinerators, thereby aiding the State and counties in reaching their sustainability, resilience, and fiscal goals. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to encourage the production of compost by: (1)  Requiring the department of health to adopt or amend rules to establish a classification system for composting facilities or operations for the purposes of regulating them for health purposes; and (2)  Allowing composting and co-composting in the agricultural district, including on lands with class A or B soils. PART II SECTION 2.  Chapter 342H, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part II to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§342H- Rules; composting facilities and operations; classification system.  (a)  The department shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to establish a classification system for composting facilities and operations for the purposes of regulating those facilities or operations for health purposes, including but not limited to: (1)  Preventing pollution; (2)  Preventing the spread of disease and the creation of nuisances; (3)  Protecting public health and safety; (4)  Conserving natural resources; and (5)  Preserving and enhancing the beauty and quality of the environment. (b)  The rules shall: (1)  Encourage food waste composting where possible; (2)  Not impose onerous requirements where unnecessary; (3)  Consider the climate and soil benefits of food waste composting; (4)  Weigh the climate risk of not composting with the perceived health risks of compost facilities of various size classes and types; provided that the health risks shall be evaluated based on the volume of food waste inputs, the composting technology used, and the size of the compost structure or pile; and (5)  Provide that only operations over a determined size and volume of food waste inputs shall be considered a municipal solid waste management facility." SECTION 3. There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 for a full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) program specialist position in the solid and hazardous waste branch to focus on updating administrative rules relating to solid waste pursuant to section 2 of this part. The sums appropriated shall be expended by the department of health for the purposes of this part.

SB271 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 271 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to statewide composting. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Department of Agriculture, food waste is the second largest component of the waste stream and accounts for twenty‑five per cent of all materials sent to landfills.  Nearly fifty per cent of organic materials disposed of in incinerators and landfills can be diverted for bioconversion, including composting. Landfills across Hawaii are rapidly reaching capacity and are facing closure and re-siting, a process that will cost each county hundreds of millions of dollars and create community resentment. Recycling organics, including food waste, into compost has environmental benefits, such as improving soil health, increasing drought resistance, and reducing the need for supplemental water, fertilizers, and pesticides, while also increasing crop yields and reducing the risk of invasive species introduction to neighboring islands through the importation of contaminated compost.  Furthermore, applying compost and organic matter to soil sequesters carbon from the atmosphere, forming the largest land-based carbon sink, and mitigates climate change by effectively reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The legislature believes that food waste diversion and the creation of multi-scale composting operations across the State will greatly reduce the burdens on landfills, lower county waste management costs, and move the State closer to achieving its sustainability and resiliency goals, which include: (1)  The Aloha+ Challenge, which is a statewide commitment to realize the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, and which sets a goal of seventy per cent waste reduction before disposal, and doubling local food production by 2030; (2)  The Hawaii 2050 sustainability plan, which mandates the State to achieve full sustainability and resilience through increased food production and dramatic waste reduction via recycling and bioconversion strategies; and (3)  Increasing the generation of local compost to sequester more carbon and mitigate climate change pursuant to the strategy identified by the greenhouse gas sequestration task force permanently established by Act 15, Session Laws of Hawaii 2018. The legislature also finds that the regulation of co‑composting in the State is under the purview of the department of health's solid and hazardous waste branch.  Existing rules have not been updated in over twenty years.  Currently, a single application applies to all co-composting operations regardless of size or scope.  The current permitting process is an onerous and unreasonable barrier to lawful participation for small to midsize composting operations whose operations present a much lower risk potential.  Reform and updating of the co-composting rules and permitting process will greatly increase the number of operators diverting organics from landfills and incinerators, thereby aiding the State and counties in reaching their sustainability, resilience, and fiscal goals. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to encourage the production of compost by: (1)  Requiring the department of health to adopt or amend rules to establish a classification system for composting facilities or operations for the purposes of regulating them for health purposes; and (2)  Allowing composting and co-composting in the agricultural district, including on lands with class A or B soils. PART II SECTION 2.  Chapter 342H, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part II to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§342H- Rules; composting facilities and operations; classification system.  (a)  The department shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to establish a classification system for composting facilities and operations for the purposes of regulating those facilities or operations for health purposes, including but not limited to: (1)  Preventing pollution; (2)  Preventing the spread of disease and the creation of nuisances; (3)  Protecting public health and safety; (4)  Conserving natural resources; and (5)  Preserving and enhancing the beauty and quality of the environment. (b)  The rules shall: (1)  Encourage food waste composting where possible; (2)  Not impose onerous requirements where unnecessary; (3)  Consider the climate and soil benefits of food waste composting; (4)  Weigh the climate risk of not composting with the perceived health risks of compost facilities of various size classes and types; provided that the health risks shall be evaluated based on the volume of food waste inputs, the composting technology used, and the size of the compost structure or pile; and (5)  Provide that only operations over a determined size and volume of food waste inputs shall be considered a municipal solid waste management facility." SECTION 3. There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 for a full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) program specialist position in the solid and hazardous waste branch to focus on updating administrative rules relating to solid waste pursuant to section 2 of this part.
