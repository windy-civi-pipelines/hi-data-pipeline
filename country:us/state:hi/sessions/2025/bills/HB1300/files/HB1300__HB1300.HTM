Section 1:
HB1300 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1300 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to cancer. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the university of Hawaii cancer center is one of seventy-one National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers in the United States.  It is the only center in Hawaii and the Pacific region.  The legislature also finds that the university of Hawaii cancer center reduces the burden of cancer through research, education, patient care, and community outreach, with an emphasis on the unique ethnic, cultural, and environmental characteristics of Hawaii and the Pacific region. Cancer incidence and mortality rates have decreased in Hawaii over the last decade, but despite this overall reduction, the disparities between ethnic populations continue to be of concern.  Native Hawaiians continue to have the highest cancer incidence and mortality rates among men and women, including higher incidences of breast and ovarian cancers.  Similarly, Filipino women have the highest incidences of ovarian and thyroid cancer.  The legislature recognizes the need to identify the root causes of these disparities.  This includes determining the health risks associated with living in close proximity to certain environmental hazards and exposures, specifically the impact of county and private waste landfills in Nanakuli, Oahu, on the surrounding Native Hawaiian communities.  The legislature finds that cancer research focusing on Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and Filipinos is a matter of statewide concern and is unique to Hawaii and the university of Hawaii cancer center and thus cannot be easily conducted anywhere else in the world. The purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds to the university of Hawaii cancer center for a multiethnic cohort study focusing on the social determinants of health, lifestyles, environmental exposures, and resilience factors of Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and Filipinos, including an analysis of the health effects and risks of individuals living in close proximity to both landfills in Nanakuli, Oahu. SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the university of Hawaii cancer center to conduct a multiethnic cohort study focusing on the social determinants of health, lifestyles, environmental exposures, and resilience factors of Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and Filipinos, including an analysis of the health effects and risks of individuals living in close proximity to landfills in Nanakuli, Oahu; provided that the analysis shall utilize water and soil sample data from the department of health and other agencies. The sums appropriated shall be expended by the university of Hawaii for the purposes of this Act. SECTION 3.  The university of Hawaii cancer center shall seek federal funding, in addition to the funds appropriated by this Act, to complete the multiethnic cohort study identified in section 2 of this Act. SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2025. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: University of Hawaii Cancer Center; Multiethnic Cohort Study; Appropriation Description: Appropriates funds to the University of Hawaii Cancer Center to conduct a multiethnic cohort study focusing on the social determinants of health, lifestyles, environmental exposures, and resilience factors of Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and Filipinos, including an analysis of the health effects and risks of individuals living in close proximity to landfills in Nanakuli, Oahu.
