Section 1:
HB1300 SD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1300 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII S.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO CANCER. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the cancer research center of Hawaii, known as the university of Hawaii cancer center, is one of seventy-one National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers in the United States.  It is the only center in Hawaii and the Pacific region.  The legislature also finds that the university of Hawaii cancer center reduces the burden of cancer through research, education, patient care, and community outreach, with an emphasis on the unique ethnic, cultural, and environmental characteristics of Hawaii and the Pacific region. Cancer incidence and mortality rates have decreased in Hawaii over the last decade, but despite this overall reduction, the disparities between ethnic populations continue to be of concern.  Native Hawaiians continue to have the highest cancer incidence and mortality rates among men and women, including higher incidences of breast and ovarian cancers.  Similarly, Filipino women have the highest incidences of ovarian and thyroid cancer.  The legislature recognizes the need to identify the root causes of these disparities. This includes determining the health risks associated with living in close proximity to certain environmental hazards and exposures, specifically the impact of county and private waste landfills in Nanakuli, Oahu, on the surrounding Native Hawaiian communities. The legislature finds that cancer research focusing on Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and Filipinos is a matter of statewide concern and is unique to Hawaii and the university of Hawaii cancer center and thus cannot be easily conducted anywhere else in the world. The purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds to the university of Hawaii cancer center for a multiethnic cohort study focusing on the social determinants of health, lifestyles, environmental exposures, and resilience factors of Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and Filipinos, including an analysis of the health effects and risks of individuals living in close proximity to both landfills in Nanakuli, Oahu. SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the university of Hawaii cancer center to conduct a multiethnic cohort study focusing on the social determinants of health, lifestyles, environmental exposures, and resilience factors of Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and Filipinos, including an analysis of the health effects and risks of individuals living in close proximity to landfills in Nanakuli, Oahu; provided that the analysis shall utilize water and soil sample data from the department of health and other agencies. The sums appropriated shall be expended by the university of Hawaii for the purposes of this Act; provided that no funds shall be expended unless matched by federal funds on a dollar-for-dollar basis. SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 3000. Report Title: UH; University of Hawaii Cancer Center; Multiethnic Cohort Study; Appropriations Description: Appropriates funds to the University of Hawaii Cancer Center to conduct a multiethnic cohort study focusing on the social determinants of health, lifestyles, environmental exposures, and resilience factors of Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and Filipinos, including an analysis of the health effects and risks of individuals living in close proximity to landfills in Nanakuli, Oahu.  Requires the appropriated funds to be matched by federal funds on a dollar-for-dollar basis before expenditure.  Effective 7/1/3000.  (SD1) The summary description of legislation appearing on this page is for informational purposes only and is not legislation or evidence of legislative intent.
