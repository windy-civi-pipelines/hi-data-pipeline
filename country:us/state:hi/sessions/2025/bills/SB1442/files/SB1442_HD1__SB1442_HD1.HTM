SB1442 HD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1442 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that addressing mental health needs early in life is imperative for better health and well-being in adulthood.  Adverse childhood experiences, which are various forms of trauma during a child's development, are linked to a greater likelihood of lifelong risky behaviors that can lead to chronic diseases and poor mental health, including depression, anxiety, and suicidality. The importance of children and adolescent mental health was emphasized during the COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly impacted the social, emotional, and mental well‑being of youth globally.  Hawaii children and adolescents, like those in other states in the nation, were more likely to have depression and anxiety after the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The child and adolescent mental health division of the department of health is the State's medicaid provider of intensive mental health services for youth.  Services provided by the division may be described as a multi-tiered and multi‑agency system of care. The child and adolescent mental health division receives referrals from, and provides mental health services in coordination and collaboration with, other state government agencies, as appropriate.  For example, the division may receive a client who is housed in a detention home, has been abused, and has dropped out of school.  The division will provide the child with treatment and services in coordination with other state agencies, including the judiciary, child welfare services, and department of education, that may be involved given the child's circumstances.  To minimize disruptions in the daily lives of the clients and their families, the division provides its clients with community-based services and supports by contracting with mental health professionals who practice near or in the communities where eligible children and adolescents live. The purpose of this Act is to clarify and update the responsibilities of the child and adolescent mental health division of the department of health to reflect the current mental health systems of care that address mental health needs of children and adolescents in the State. SECTION 2.  Chapter 321, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part XV to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§321-    Definitions.  As used in this part: "Client" means a child or adolescent who is receiving services from the child and adolescent mental health division. "Division" means the child and adolescent mental health division of the department of health." SECTION 3.  Section 321-171, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending the title of part XI to read as follows: "PART XV.  MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR CHILDREN AND [YOUTH] ADOLESCENTS" SECTION 4.  Section 321-171, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§321-171  [Children's mental] Mental health services[;] for children and adolescents; department responsibility.
