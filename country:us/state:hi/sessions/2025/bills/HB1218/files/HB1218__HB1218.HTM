Section 1:
HB1218 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1218 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to homelessness. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that many homeless persons thrive when they have ready access to familiar support groups and loving family members.  In Hawaii, some homeless persons are currently stranded in the State, far from their families, because they lack the financial resources to return home. The legislature recognizes that Hawaii has limited resources for human services, and some homeless persons may find that their families or home states are better equipped to provide long-term care and support. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Establish and appropriate moneys for a return-to-home program to provide travel expenses and relocation assistance for eligible persons who wish to return to their home states; and (2)  Require the department of human services to develop and implement a public information campaign related to the State's residency requirements and return-to-home program. SECTION 2.  Chapter 346, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part XVII to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§346-     Return-to-home program.  (a)  There is established within the department the return-to-home program to provide travel expenses and relocation assistance for eligible persons who wish to return to their home states. (b)  For purposes of the program, the department shall: (1)  Establish a public-private partnership by contracting with eligible nonprofit organizations, for-profit organizations, or foundations to administer the program without regard to chapters 103D and 103F; (2)  Seek the participation of local airlines, passenger ship lines, charter companies, travel agencies, and the visitor industry; (3)  Coordinate with federal programs, including the United States Repatriation Program, to maximize resources and avoid a duplication of services; (4)  Seek assistance and input from the governor's coordinator on homelessness; and (5)  Work with homeless outreach programs to ensure that persons who wish to participate are made aware of the program and that vulnerable populations, including victims of domestic violence or human trafficking, are not involuntarily displaced. (c)  A person shall be eligible to participate in the return-to-home program if the person: (1)  Agrees to participate in the program voluntarily; (2)  Maintains legal residence in a state other than Hawaii; (3)  Has no verifiable permanent address in Hawaii; (4)  Lacks financial independence, including a return ticket or the financial means to return home; (5)  Is unemployed; and (6)  Is reliant, or at risk of becoming reliant, on state assistance programs; provided that a person having at least one dependent child who resides in the State, or a person receiving medical treatment that cannot be interrupted, shall not be eligible to participate in the program. (d)  The department shall verify the information required by subsection (c) to prevent fraudulent claims or involuntary displacement and shall allow a person who is made a participant in the program without the person's consent, or a person who wishes to participate in the program but is denied eligibility, to immediately appeal the decision. (e)  The department shall submit a report of its findings and recommendations, including the number of return-to-home program participants for the previous year, costs, program outcomes, and any proposed legislation, to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular session. (f)  For the purposes of this section: "Home state" means a person's legal state of residence. "Permanent address" means a verifiable physical residence that a person owns, rents, or resides in with family.
