Section 1:
SB1051 SD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1051 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO HAWAIIAN HISTORY MONTH. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that in the month of September, Queen Liliuokalani's birth, life, and legacy is remembered and celebrated in the Hawaiian community, including at churches and Hawaiian organizations, such as Kawaiahao Church's Alii Sunday, the Liliuokalani Trust Kipuka (children centers), and the Kamehameha Schools. The legislature further finds that the Hawaii Ponoi Coalition, founded in 2007, was formed to educate those who live in and visit the islands about Hawaii's true history, the Native Hawaiian people, and the culture that makes Hawaii a place like no other.  In September 2007, the Coalition launched a commemorative event on the grounds of Iolani Palace to celebrate the birthday of Queen Liliuokalani. The legislature concludes that designating September as Hawaiian History Month would be an appropriate way to honor Queen Liliuokalani and recognize the contributions of the Native Hawaiian community, while also providing community building, educational, and economic opportunities. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to designate September as Hawaiian History Month. SECTION 2. Chapter 8, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§8-    Hawaiian History Month.  The month of September shall be known and designated as "Hawaiian History Month" to promote public awareness, honor Queen Liliuokalani, and recognize the contributions of the Native Hawaiian community.  This month is not and shall not be construed as a state holiday." SECTION 3. New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 4. This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2050. Report Title: Hawaiian History Month; Month of Observance Description: Designates September as Hawaiian History Month. Effective 7/1/2050.  (SD1) The summary description of legislation appearing on this page is for informational purposes only and is not legislation or evidence of legislative intent.
