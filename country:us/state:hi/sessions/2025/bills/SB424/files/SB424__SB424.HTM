Section 1:
SB424 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 424 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT Relating to Labor standards at health care facilities. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the health and safety of the State's residents depend on ensuring that registered nurses are supported in providing high-quality, patient-centered care.  Adequate patient-nurse staffing ratios are critical to achieving this goal, as they directly impact patient safety, reduce nurse burnout, and promote nurse retention in the workforce.  The legislature recognizes that improving patient-to-nurse ratios leads to better patient outcomes, enhanced care quality, and a more sustainable health care system.  By establishing minimum patient-to-nurse staffing ratios and requiring hospitals to implement and adhere to enforceable staffing plans, the State can protect its health care workforce, reduce turnover, and ensure that patients receive the safe, timely care they deserve. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Establish minimum registered nurse staffing standards for hospitals; (2)  Require hospitals to create a hospital registered nurse staffing committee; and (3)  Appropriate funds to the department of labor and industrial relations to enforce these requirements.

The hospital shall provide involved employees with notice of any extension. (e)  A variance shall be granted if the department determines that there is good cause for allowing a hospital to not comply with the minimum registered nurse staffing standards.  The variance order shall state: (1)  The alternative minimum registered nurse staffing standards approved; (2)  The basis for a finding of good cause; (3)  The group of employees impacted; and (4)  The period of time for which the variance will be valid; provided that the validity period shall not exceed thirty days from the date of issuance. (f)  The department shall issue its decision in writing. If the variance is granted, the department shall provide a notification in writing to the hospital and, if applicable, the union representatives of the involved employees.  If the variance is denied, the written notification shall include a stated basis for the denial. (g) A hospital, involved employees, and, if applicable, their union representative, may file with the director a request for reconsideration of the department's decision within five days after receiving notice of the variance determination.  The request for reconsideration shall set forth the grounds upon which the request is being made.  If reasonable grounds exist, the director may grant a review and, to the extent deemed appropriate, afford all interested parties an opportunity to be heard; provided that the written decision of the department shall remain in effect until the reconsideration process is complete.  The department shall issue its decision in writing no later than ten days after the date the request for reconsideration was filed with the department. (h)  Unless subject to the reconsideration process, the director may revoke or terminate the variance order at any time after giving the hospital at least five-days notice before revoking or terminating the order. (i)  Where immediate variance from the minimum registered nurse staffing standards is necessary, the department may issue a temporary variance that shall remain valid until the department determines whether good cause exists for issuing a variance.  A hospital need not meet the requirement in subsection (b)(4) to be granted a temporary variance.  If a temporary variance is granted, the department shall issue a temporary variance order no later than fifteen days after the date the variance application was filed pursuant to subsection (d).  The duration of the temporary variance shall be counted towards the thirty‑day variance period provided in subsection (e)(4).  No extension of a temporary variance shall be permitted. (j)  If a hospital obtains a variance under this section, the hospital shall inform involved employees about the minimum registered nurse staffing standards that apply within five days of receiving notification of the variance approval from the department.  A hospital shall make this information readily available to all employees.
