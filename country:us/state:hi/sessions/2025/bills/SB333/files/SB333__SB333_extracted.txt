Section 1:
SB333 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 333 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO HEALTH. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that in 2023, thirty-three states, including Hawaii, filed a suit against Meta Platforms, Inc.; Instagram, LLC; and other companies for deliberately designing addictive features on their platforms.  The legislature further finds that excessive social media use is one of a wide range of online activities that individuals may engage with problematically.  Additionally, various vulnerable and underserved communities in the State are disproportionately engaged in addictive or problematic online activities. The legislature finds however, that many online activities are largely unregulated and unmonitored, and many users engage with addictive or problematic online activities privately and anonymously, inhibiting recognition of the problem by oneself, family, or partners.  Although the State does not tolerate disingenuous and predatory practices against vulnerable populations including children, it is difficult to determine what supports and safeguards are needed for its constituents without understanding the behaviors or activities the constituents engage in. Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to require the department of health to conduct a study to evaluate State residents' engagement with a range of online activities that can be inherently addictive and disproportionately affect vulnerable and minority populations. SECTION 2.  (a)  The department of health shall conduct a study to evaluate State residents' engagement with a range of online activities that can be inherently addictive and disproportionately affect vulnerable and minority populations.  To better understand local participation in potentially addictive online activities, the study shall include a prevalence survey to measure participation in social media, mobile phone use, video gaming, high-risk stock and cryptocurrency trading, and a range of other behaviors with a risk to cause harm. (b) The department of health shall submit a report of its findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 2026. SECTION 3. There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 for the department of health to conduct a study on addictive online activities pursuant to section 2 of this Act. The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of health for the purposes of this Act. SECTION 4. This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2025. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: DOH; Study; Addictive Online Activities; Report; Appropriation Description: Requires the Department of Health to conduct a study on addictive online activities engaged in by residents of the State and submit a report to the Legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2026.  Appropriates funds.
