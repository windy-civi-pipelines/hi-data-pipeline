SB1618 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1618 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to journalism. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that in today's rapidly evolving media landscape, the need for ethical standards in journalism has never been more urgent.  The rise of social media, deepfake technologies, and generative AI has amplified the spread of misinformation, posing new challenges for journalism and public trust.  Pew Research data shows a significant decline in public confidence in media, underscoring the importance of fostering transparency and accountability through ethical journalistic practices.  Traditional journalism, though valuable, often falls short in addressing the ethical dilemmas presented by emerging technologies.  The legislature believes that strengthening ethical standards for media outlets will enable the State to combat misinformation, rebuild trust, protect the privacy of citizens, and equip them with the necessary tools to adapt to the digital age. The legislature further finds that it is a matter of statewide concern pursuant to article X, section 6, of the Hawaii State Constitution, to require the board of regents to analyze and determine the effectiveness of the media ethics course required for a bachelor of arts in journalism at the university of Hawaii at Manoa college of social sciences. Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to promote responsible journalism by: (1)  Establishing baseline ethical standards and transparency requirements for journalists, editors, or news media outlets operating in Hawaii, while protecting their rights to exercise freedom of speech or freedom of the press; and (2)  Directing the board of regents of the university of Hawaii to conduct an analysis of the degree requirements for a bachelor of arts in journalism at the university of Hawaii at Manoa college of social sciences.
