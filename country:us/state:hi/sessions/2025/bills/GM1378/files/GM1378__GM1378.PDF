STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO DISABILITY HEALTH DISPARITY.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that adults with
2 intellectual or developmental disabilities experience
3 disproportionate health disparities compared to those without
4 disabilities. Individuals with intellectual or developmental
5 disabilities are more likely than their peers without
6 disabilities to have fair or poor health, be considered obese,
7 and be diagnosed with chronic diseases, such as diabetes.
8 Intellectual and developmental disabilities are life-long
9 differences that typically arise before adulthood and can
10 uniquely influence the trajectory of an individual's life,
11 including their physical, intellectual, behavioral, and
12 emotional development. The state council on developmental
13 disabilities was created to advocate for and improve and protect
14 the lives of individuals with intellectual or developmental
15 disabilities in the State.
16 Decades of research have clearly established that members
17 of minority groups living in the United States receive poor

1 health care and have poor health outcomes resulting from social
2 determinants of health. On a national level, racial and ethnic
3 disparities in access to health care and health outcomes are a
4 persistent, pervasive public health problem. In the State,
5 underserved populations, such as Native Hawaiians and other
6 Pacific Islanders, have been historically underrepresented in
7 health care, as data does not accurately reflect the health
8 disparities currently faced by this group. Additionally,
9 individuals from the neighbor islands are also underrepresented
10 and underserved, as access to health care resources and services
11 are limited. However, even less is known about the extent of
12 racial and ethnic health disparities among adults with
13 intellectual or developmental disabilities. Accordingly, there
14 is an urgent need to create an updated, accurate set of data
15 that reflects the State's unique need to assist certain agencies
16 to better understand the needs of individuals with intellectual
17 or developmental disabilities in their communities.
18 The legislature further finds troubling gaps in the health
19 disparities of people with intellectual or developmental
20 disabilities and their social determinants of health in the
21 State. Certain recent health surveys in the State and existing

C.D. 1
1 related initiatives do not segregate data pertaining to
2 individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities, nor
3 is the data publicly available. Presently, the State relies on
4 prevalence rate data from the federal government published in
5 1994-1995 that does not reflect the State's current population
6 and its specific needs. The State's prevalence rate is 1.58 per
7 cent, which equals approximately twenty-two thousand people who
8 have an intellectual or developmental disability. Additionally,
9 the only substantial data the state council on developmental
10 disabilities collects on intellectual or developmental
11 disabilities is through the medicaid waiver program, which
12 serves approximately three thousand people. As there is a gap
13 of approximately nineteen thousand people who may have an
14 intellectual or developmental disability in the State, there is
IS little information on quality of life, health care access, and
16 health care outcomes for uncounted individuals with intellectual
17 or developmental disabilities.
18 Accordingly, the legislature finds that further research is
19 needed to understand the health disparities of people with
20 intellectual or developmental disabilities and their social
21 determinants of health. It is therefore imperative for the

1 State to establish fundamental baseline data for service
2 evaluation, policy development, and research to serve the
3 current and future needs of individuals with intellectual or
4 developmental disabilities. Accurate, current data will also
5 help the State to provide culturally appropriate health care,
6 address barriers to health care access, reduce health
7 disparities, increase employment opportunities, and support
8 individuals with developmental or intellectual disabilities to
9 live healthy lives in the community.
10 Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to require, and
11 appropriate funds for, the state council on developmental
12 disabilities to study the health disparities experienced by
13 individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities in
14 the State to develop data to inform the State's public health
IS policies and practices.
16 SECTION 2. (a) The state council on developmental
17 disabilities shall collect comprehensive data to identify gaps
18 in social determinants of health, especially in the areas of
19 health care access and quality and economic stability, that
20 affect health outcomes and health disparities experienced by
21 individuals with intellectual or development disabilities in the
