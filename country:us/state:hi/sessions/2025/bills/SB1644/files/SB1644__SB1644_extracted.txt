Section 1:
SB1644 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1644 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO TRANSPORTATION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the Honolulu authority for rapid transportation's project to construct a fixed guideway system from Kapolei to Honolulu has been beset by a multitude of problems over the last fifteen years.  The full line from east Kapolei to Ala Moana Center was originally projected to be completed by 2019 at a cost of approximately $5,000,000,000.  However, due to delays and mismanagement since this projection was made, the project's length was cut by 1.25 miles; the project's completion date was delayed by twelve years; and the project's cost has more than doubled to $11,000,000,000. The delays have caused a multitude of lawsuits.  Most recently, Hitachi Rail sued the city and county of Honolulu and the Honolulu authority for rapid transportation for $324,000,000 in damages allegedly caused by the project's many delays. The legislature finds that the entire structure of the Honolulu rail project should be revamped to ensure the project is finished without additional delays and cost overruns.  This revamping must include a complete overhaul of the project's structure and leadership.  In particular, the legislature finds that making the state department of transportation responsible for construction of the project may allow the project to benefit from the department of transportation's expertise in transportation, infrastructure, construction, and procurement. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to transfer to the department of transportation the authority to develop fixed guideway systems in counties having a population greater than five hundred thousand, including the Honolulu Skyline system that is currently being constructed by the Honolulu authority for rapid transportation. SECTION 2.  Chapter 27, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§27- Development of a fixed guideway system.  The development of a fixed guideway system in a county having a population greater than five hundred thousand shall be a function of the state government." SECTION 3.  The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to title 15 to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Chapter FIXED GUIDEWAY DEVELOPMENT PART I.

Raw Text:
SB1644 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1644 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO TRANSPORTATION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the Honolulu authority for rapid transportation's project to construct a fixed guideway system from Kapolei to Honolulu has been beset by a multitude of problems over the last fifteen years.  The full line from east Kapolei to Ala Moana Center was originally projected to be completed by 2019 at a cost of approximately $5,000,000,000.  However, due to delays and mismanagement since this projection was made, the project's length was cut by 1.25 miles; the project's completion date was delayed by twelve years; and the project's cost has more than doubled to $11,000,000,000. The delays have caused a multitude of lawsuits.  Most recently, Hitachi Rail sued the city and county of Honolulu and the Honolulu authority for rapid transportation for $324,000,000 in damages allegedly caused by the project's many delays. The legislature finds that the entire structure of the Honolulu rail project should be revamped to ensure the project is finished without additional delays and cost overruns.  This revamping must include a complete overhaul of the project's structure and leadership.  In particular, the legislature finds that making the state department of transportation responsible for construction of the project may allow the project to benefit from the department of transportation's expertise in transportation, infrastructure, construction, and procurement. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to transfer to the department of transportation the authority to develop fixed guideway systems in counties having a population greater than five hundred thousand, including the Honolulu Skyline system that is currently being constructed by the Honolulu authority for rapid transportation. SECTION 2.  Chapter 27, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§27- Development of a fixed guideway system.  The development of a fixed guideway system in a county having a population greater than five hundred thousand shall be a function of the state government."
