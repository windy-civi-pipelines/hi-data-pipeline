THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 2
STATE OF HAWAII * ' * S.D. 2
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO NUISANCES.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the department of
2 health's responsibility to protect both public and environmental
3 health is essential, especially as climate change increases
4 pressures on resources and communities. The recognition that
5 the health of a community is closely tied to environmental
6 conditions underscores the importance of preventing threats to
7 the environment. Therefore, it is critical that the department
8 of health has the clear legal authority and mandate to act not
9 only in response to direct threats of disease but also when
10 nuisances pose a risk to the public or environmental health of a
11 community.
12 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to clarify the
13 legal authority of the department of health to prevent and
14 address nuisances that threaten public or environmental health,
15 both of which affect the overall health and well-being of the
16 people of the State as a whole.
