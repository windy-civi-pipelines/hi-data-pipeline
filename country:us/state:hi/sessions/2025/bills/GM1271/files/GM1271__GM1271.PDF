This is to inform you that on June 3, 2025, the following bill was signed into law:

THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO TRANSPORTATION.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that roadway safety is
2 the top transportation priority. Pedestrians, bicyclists, and
3 other vulnerable roadway users are disproportionately impacted
4 by traffic fatalities and injuries, which are on the rise.
5 Between the 2009 to 2013 and the 2014 to 2018 five-year time
6 periods, pedestrian fatalities across the State rose by
7 twenty-six per cent. Decades of automobile-centric planning and
8 development have created formidable mobility barriers, including
9 the lack of safe and accessible bicycle and pedestrian
10 infrastructure. Under Navahine v. Hawai'i Department of
11 Transportation, CIVIL NO. lCCV-22-0000631 (Hawaii Cir. Ct.), the
12 State has committed to completing its multimodal, bike and
13 pedestrian network within the next five years.
14 The legislature further finds that a disproportionately
15 high number of pedestrian injuries and deaths occur at
16 crosswalks and intersections. One solution proven to help

1 reduce these tragedies is to allow pedestrians and motorists
2 greater visibility as they enter and drive through crosswalks.
3 The legislature finds that illegal parking near crosswalks
4 and intersections creates dangerous conditions for pedestrians,
5 particularly children walking to school. To ensure that fines
6 from these violations are used to improve pedestrian safety,
7 these revenues should be deposited into the safe routes to
8 school program special fund to fund infrastructure improvements
9 that promote public safety.
10 Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to:
11 (1) Prohibit street parking within twenty feet on each
12 side of any crosswalk or intersection, regardless of
13 the presence or absence of official signs or curb
14 markings;
15 (2) Require fines collected for street parking
16 restrictions to be deposited into the safe routes to
17 school program special fund; and
18 (3) Specify that signs or curb markings are not required
19 to restrict parking within twenty feet of a crosswalk
20 or intersection.
