request for additional general funds as emergency appropriations for FY 25 for
operating shortfalls in the fourth quarter funding for PSD 407 - O'ahu Community
Correctional Center and PSD 405 - Hawai'i Community Correctional Center to ensure
that sufficient funds are available to cover a payroll shortfall and higher operational costs
