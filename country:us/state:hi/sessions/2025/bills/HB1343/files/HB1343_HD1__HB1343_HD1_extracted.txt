Section 1:
HB1343 HD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1343 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO EDUCATION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that cellphone use in schools can be detrimental to student achievement and wellbeing.  Research has shown that allowing cellphones in the classroom impacts student focus and engagement, leading to decreased academic performance on tests and adversely impacting students' long-term learning retention.  Excessive cellphone use can also distract students from in-person socialization, which is critical for students' physical and mental wellbeing. The legislature further finds that there is a growing number of states that are banning or restricting cellphone use in schools.  At least nineteen states have passed laws or enacted policies that ban or restrict students' use of cellphones in schools statewide or have recommended that local districts enact bans or restrictive policies.  In Hawaii, efforts to ban cellphones in schools have had a positive impact on students, with teachers reporting fewer distractions in class and more social interactions among students. The legislature declares that banning the use of cell phones and related devices, such as smart watches, earbuds, AirPods, Bluetooth connected headphones, and smart glasses, by students during school hours is a matter of statewide concern. The purpose of this Act is to require the board of education to adopt a policy that bans the use of cell phones and related devices, such as smart watches, earbuds, AirPods, Bluetooth connected headphones, and smart glasses, by students during school hours. SECTION 2.  Chapter 302A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§302A-     Phone-and-related-devices-free, bell-to-bell policy.  The board shall establish a phone-and-related-devices-free, bell-to-bell policy for public schools to be implemented beginning with the 2025-2026 school year; provided that the policy may be implemented in phases for each school level." SECTION 3.  New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 3000. Report Title: Department of Education; Phones; Related Devices; Ban Description: Requires the Board of Education to adopt a policy that bans the use of phones and related devices by students during school hours.  Effective 7/1/3000.  (HD1) The summary description of legislation appearing on this page is for informational purposes only and is not legislation or evidence of legislative intent.
