Section 1:
SB8 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 8 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to jury duty. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that advance practice registered nurses (APRNs) in the State have full practice authority and provide primary and specialist care to the elderly, disabled, and all of the people in the State.  The legislature also finds that the care provided by APRNs is comparable in outcomes to those of their physician colleagues.  With advances in legislation to improve access to care by APRNs, many have been able to establish freestanding practices under their own professional corporations similar to those of physicians.  According to section 612-6, Hawaii Revised Statutes, of all healthcare professionals, only physicians and dentists are exempt from serving jury duty.  The legislature finds that removing an APRN from their daily practice to serve on a jury deprives their patients of needed healthcare and can also be a financial hardship to the APRN who owns their own practice and must pay for their overhead, whether or not they are on site at the practice.  The legislature also finds that a jury duty exemption does not preclude a person from jury duty service if they choose to serve. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to allow advance practice registered nurses to claim exemption from service as a juror. SECTION 2.  Section 612-6, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§612-6  Exempt when.  A person may claim exemption from service as a juror if the person is: (1)  An elected official while the legislature is in session, or a judge of the United States, State, or county; (2)  An actively practicing physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or dentist; (3)  A member of the armed forces or militia when on active service and deployed out-of-state; (4)  An active member of a police or fire department; (5)  A person who has served as a juror, either in a court of this State or the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii, within one year preceding the time of filling out the juror qualification form; (6)  An active member of an emergency medical services agency; (7)  A person living more than seventy miles from the court for which jury service is required; (8)  A person eighty years of age or older; or (9)  A woman who is breastfeeding a child or expressing breast milk for a period of two years from the birth of the child. For purposes of this section, "emergency medical services agency" means any government agency, private agency, or company that provides ambulance services, emergency medical services, or disaster medical services." SECTION 3. New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 4. This Act shall take effect upon its approval. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: Jury Duty; Advance Practice Registered Nurses; Exemption Description: Allows an advance practice registered nurse to claim exemption from service as a juror.
