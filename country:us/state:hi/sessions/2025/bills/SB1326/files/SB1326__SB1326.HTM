Section 1:
SB1326 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1326 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE HAWAII COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Act 184, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022 (Act 184), which established transit‑oriented development infrastructure improvement districts, could be more efficient. The transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement districts were comprised of the land within county-designated transit-oriented development zones or within a one-half mile radius of a proposed or existing transit station if the county has not designated transit-oriented development zones, as designated by the board.  Act 184 also established the transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement district boards for each county, under the Hawaii community development authority for administrative purposes.  To date these boards have not been constituted, due in part to a lack of community volunteers willing to serve. The purpose of this Act is to streamline transit-oriented development infrastructure improvements by making chapter 206E, part X, Hawaii Revised Statutes, a program under the Hawaii community development authority and making additional consistent revisions to chapter 206E, Hawaii Revised Statutes. SECTION 2.  Section 206E-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§206E-1  Findings and purpose.  The legislature finds that many areas of the State are substantially undeveloped, blighted, or economically depressed, and are or are potentially in need of renewal, renovation, or improvement to alleviate such conditions as dilapidation, deterioration, age, and other such factors or conditions [which] that make such areas an economic or social liability. The legislature further finds that there exists within the State vast, unmet community development needs.  These include, but are not limited to, a lack of suitable affordable housing; insufficient commercial and industrial facilities for rent; residential areas [which] that do not have facilities necessary for basic liveability, such as parks and open space; [and] areas [which] that are planned for extensive land allocation to one, rather than mixed uses[.]; a lack of infrastructure necessary to facilitate community development; and insufficient culturally appropriate agriculture, education, and natural-resource restoration and management. It is further determined that the lack of planning and coordination in such areas has given rise to these community development needs and that existing laws and public and private mechanisms have either proven incapable or inadequate to facilitate timely redevelopment and renewal[.], or restoration and management, as the case may be. The legislature finds that a new and comprehensive authority for community development must be created to join the strengths of private enterprise, public development, and regulation into a new form capable of long-range planning and implementation of improved community development.  The purpose of this chapter is to establish such a mechanism in the Hawaii community development authority, which is a public entity [which] that shall determine community development programs and projects and cooperate with private enterprise and the various components of federal, state, and county governments in bringing plans and projects to fruition.  [For such areas designated as community development districts, the] The legislature believes that the planning and implementation [program] expertise of the Hawaii community development authority will result in communities [which] that serve the highest needs and aspirations of Hawaii's people. The legislature finds that the creation of the Hawaii community development authority, the establishment of community development districts[, and] and program areas, the issuance of bonds pursuant to this chapter to finance public facilities, and the ability of the Hawaii community development authority to cooperate with or assist public and private sector entities to engage in projects that improve the State, serve the public interest and are matters of statewide concern." SECTION 3.  Chapter 206E, part X, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "[[]Part X.[]]  Transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement [district] Program [[]§206E-241[]]  Findings and purpose.  The legislature finds that construction, installation, and improvement of certain infrastructure is necessary and desirable to facilitate renewal and redevelopment of areas designated by the State and the counties for transit-oriented development.  Transit-oriented development is a powerful tool that can ultimately deliver a wide range of social, environmental, and economic benefits.  Transit-oriented development promotes development patterns that support quality of life, preserves the natural environment, provides a range of housing choices for residents, and encourages walking, biking, and use of mass transit.  The State plays an important role in overcoming barriers to transit‑oriented development, including encouraging needed investments in improving regional infrastructure such as roads, sewers, water, power, communication, and storm water management systems.  This part is intended to move transit-oriented development planning efforts forward into infrastructure improvements that benefit the community.  The legislature further finds that, currently, no single state agency has the authority to improve infrastructure along a transit corridor in the best interest of the State. This part will enable the delivery of infrastructure needed to support development on lands within designated transit-oriented development zones. Accordingly, [the purpose of this part is to establish] there is established the transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement [districts] program to be administered by the authority to foster community development by strategically investing in infrastructure improvements. [[]§206E-242[]]  Definitions.  As used in this part: ["Board" means the transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement district board. "District" means the transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement district within each county-designated transit-oriented development zone, or within a one-half mile radius of a proposed or existing transit station if the county has not designated transit-oriented development zones, as determined by the board.] "Fund" means the transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement [district] program special fund established under section 206E-247. "Program" means the transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement [district] program developed by the [board] authority pursuant to section 206E-246.
