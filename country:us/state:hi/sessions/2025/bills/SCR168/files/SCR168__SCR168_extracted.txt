SCR168 THE SENATE S.C.R. NO. 168 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION requesting the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands to develop and implement a Water Access Pilot Project demonstrating the kohala region's capacity for a potable water system. WHEREAS, the Kohala mountains on Hawaii island represent an ideal location for a water pump storage hydroelectric facility due to the unique geography of the region; and WHEREAS, the elevation of the Kohala mountains facilitates the downhill flow of water through a series of reservoirs to generate electricity; and WHEREAS, wind turbines are a complementary source of renewable energy that augment the generation of electricity; and WHEREAS, in the evenings when the demand for electricity is lower, the energy generated by the wind turbines would be used to pump the water stored in reservoirs at lower elevations to reservoirs at higher elevations, preparing it for the next day's energy needs; and WHEREAS, the State is in need of a comprehensive water plan for both potable and irrigation water, a comprehensive agricultural plan that includes local production and processing, and a comprehensive renewable energy plan that complements agriculture; and WHEREAS, a water pump storage hydroelectric facility is a critical component of these comprehensive plans as it would provide a source of potable water, water for irrigation, and reduce energy costs; and WHEREAS, the ideal parcel of land located in the Kohala mountains for the construction of the facility is owned by the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands; and WHEREAS, construction of a water pump storage hydroelectric facility would increase the potential availability of potable water and attract more native Hawaiian beneficiaries of the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands to the area; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, the House of Representatives concurring, that the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands is requested to develop and implement a Water Access Pilot Project demonstrating the Kohala region's ability to access water and develop a potable water system; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands is requested to submit a report of its findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, to the Legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2026; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a certified copy of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Chairperson of the Hawaiian Homes Commission.
