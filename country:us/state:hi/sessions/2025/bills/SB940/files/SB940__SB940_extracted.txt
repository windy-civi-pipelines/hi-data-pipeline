Section 1:

BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that a diet that consists of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds, and herbs and spices has been shown to reduce the chance of developing diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and various forms of cancer, among other chronic diseases.  Many students, including a large majority of Asian-American students, are lactose-intolerant and should have an option to avoid dairy products.  Offering meal options to students that consist of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, herbs and spices, and non-dairy beverages can promote a healthy lifestyle for the State's youth and provide broader choices for students.
