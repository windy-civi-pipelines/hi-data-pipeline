HB872 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 872 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to health. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that a food allergy reaction can cause symptoms that range from mild to life-threatening.  In the United States, food allergy is the leading cause of severe, life-threatening allergic reactions, known as anaphylaxis, outside the hospital setting. Anaphylaxis is characterized by rapid onset and the involvement of multiple organ systems, including the skin, respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, and cardiovascular system.  Common triggers of anaphylaxis include foods, insect stings, medications, and latex particles.  People who have previously experienced only mild symptoms may suddenly experience a life-threatening reaction. The legislature further finds that the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis is epinephrine, also known as adrenaline.  Epinephrine is available by prescription in an auto-injector and works to reverse the life-threatening symptoms.  For this reason, the timely administration of epinephrine reduces the risk of fatal or debilitating outcomes associated with anaphylaxis, particularly when medical assistance may be delayed, unavailable, or distant. The legislature recognizes that one public health strategy to reduce adverse outcomes related to allergic reactions is to substantially increase access to epinephrine by allowing various entities to stock a supply of undesignated epinephrine.  Through this strategy, public safety improves as epinephrine availability increases, improving survival rates and health outcomes for persons affected by severe allergies.  This strategy was recognized on the federal level through the signing of the School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act in 2013, which encouraged schools to plan for severe allergic reactions. The legislature notes that more than thirty states have enacted this strategy into law; however, Hawaii has yet to implement this strategy. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to authorize health care practitioners to make undesignated prescriptions of epinephrine for the purpose of stocking a supply at various types of businesses and government offices. SECTION 2.  Chapter 27, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part III to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§27-     Supply of auto-injectable epinephrine.  (a)  A practitioner, including practitioners employed by the department of health, may prescribe auto-injectable epinephrine in the name of the State for use in accordance with this section.  Departments and agencies may acquire and stock a supply of auto-injectable epinephrine pursuant to prescriptions issued under this subsection. (b)  Each department and agency shall permit employees and agents to volunteer to provide or administer auto-injectable epinephrine to any individual who the employee or agent believes in good faith is experiencing anaphylaxis, regardless of whether the individual has a prescription for auto-injectable epinephrine or has previously been diagnosed with an allergy. (c)  Any employee or agent who volunteers to administer auto-injectable epinephrine shall receive instruction in the proper administration of auto-injectable epinephrine by a practitioner. (d)  A department or an agency that possesses and makes available auto-injectable epinephrine and its employees, agents, and other individuals; a practitioner who prescribes or dispenses auto-injectable epinephrine to a department or an agency; and a pharmacist or practitioner who dispenses auto-injectable epinephrine to a department or an agency shall not be liable for any injuries or related damages that result from any act or omission taken pursuant to this section; provided that this immunity shall not apply to acts or omissions constituting wilful or wanton misconduct (e)  As used in this section: "Auto-injectable epinephrine" means a single-use device used for the automatic injection of a premeasured dose of epinephrine into the human body.
