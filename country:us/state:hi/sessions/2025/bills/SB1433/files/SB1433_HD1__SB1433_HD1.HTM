SB1433 HD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1433 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO HARM REDUCTION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that sharing injection equipment among individuals who use drugs is a major contribution to the spread of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and other serious bloodborne infections.  Act 152, Session Laws of Hawaii 1992, authorized the establishment of the first state-funded sterile needle and syringe exchange program in the United States.  The program has aimed to prevent the transmission of bloodborne pathogens and to provide individuals who inject drugs with services such as referrals to appropriate health and social services, thereby reducing overall disease burden in Hawaii. Over the past thirty years, extensive scientific research has confirmed that syringe exchange programs nationwide effectively reduce disease transmission, increase access to addiction treatment, improve public safety, lower health care costs, and do not lead to an increase in drug use or crime. Research has also helped identify the most effective approaches in what are now commonly referred to as "syringe services programs". A 2020 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United States Department of Health and Human Services, concluded that syringe programs that restrict syringe distribution to one-to-one exchange are less effective than needs-based distribution programs that provide sterile needles and syringes to syringe exchange participants in quantities sufficient to reduce the likelihood of needles and syringes being shared or reused.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention supports needs-based approaches to syringe distribution based on evidence that it is the best practice for reducing new HIV and viral hepatitis infections.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concludes that, compared to one-to-one exchanges, needs-based syringe distribution results in less syringe sharing and reuse, lowers risk of infection, and is not associated with increased unsafe syringe disposal.  Research shows that syringe distribution programs are safe, effective, cost-saving, do not increase drug use or crime, and do not cause people to begin injecting drugs.  However, Hawaii and Florida remain the only states that impose a strict one‑to‑one sterile needle and syringe exchange limit. This Act will authorize the State's syringe exchange program to transition from a one-to-one exchange model to a needs-based distribution system. Syringes and needles are not the only injection equipment that contribute to the spread of infection.  Any materials used in the preparation or administration of drugs may potentially transmit pathogens or cause injury when shared or reused. The Model Syringe Services Program Act, a model legislation released by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy in December 2021, recommends extending protection from criminal liability under drug paraphernalia statutes to syringe program staff, volunteers, and participants while implementing or accessing program services intended to reduce transmission of bloodborne infections.  This Act makes amendments consistent with those recommendations. In alignment with recommendations for improving effectiveness, the State's sterile needle and syringe exchange program also facilitates access to critical health services necessary for participants. These include educating participants about the dangers of contracting HIV through sharing drug injection equipment and offering counseling services and referrals for treatment of substance use disorders.  Furthermore, individuals who do not inject drugs but are marginalized often seek harm reduction information, supplies, and referrals to other services through the program.  This Act will remove the requirement that the program exclude non-injection drug users, ensuring the program can assist individuals in need when resources are available. Syringe services programs also play a crucial role in collecting and safely disposing of used injection equipment.  Safe disposal occurs most effectively if program participants batch all used injection equipment for safe disposal by syringe services programs.  However, participants may be reluctant to batch used injection equipment for safe disposal if they risk criminal penalties for drug residue found on used equipment. Extending protection from arrest and prosecution for possession of drug residue on used syringes and needles to program participants will increase the likelihood of proper disposal, thereby reducing public health risk.  Program staff regularly encourage participants to batch and return all used injection equipment to the syringe exchange program, not only for the safety of the community, but also to assist in ensuring the program's continuity.  For these reasons, the Model Syringe Services Program Act recommends providing immunity from criminal penalties for possession of a controlled substance or other illicit drug due to the presence of residue in a hypodermic needle or syringe or other supplies. The purpose of this Act is to improve the safety, effectiveness, and cost savings of the State's sterile needle and syringe exchange program by amending the program based on current recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy's model legislation. SECTION 2.  Section 325-111, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended: 1.  By adding five new definitions to be appropriately inserted and to read: ""Authorized objects" means objects authorized by the department for dissemination to syringe exchange participants for the purpose of reducing infection or injury; provided that the objects are incidental to syringe exchange.  "Authorized objects" may include but are not limited to cookers, cottons, or ties. "Needs-based distribution" means a syringe distribution practice that provides sterile needles and syringes to syringe exchange participants in quantities sufficient to reduce the likelihood of needles and syringes being shared or reused. "Program staff" means an employee of the department or its designee who is specifically tasked with procuring, handling, transporting, and providing sterile needles, syringes, and authorized objects and services to syringe exchange participants. "Residue" means the amount of controlled substance, as that term is defined in section 329-1, remaining in a syringe and needle after the plunger stopper is fully depressed. "Syringe exchange participant" means an injection drug user who receives a sterile needle and syringe pursuant to the program." 2.  By deleting the definition of "participant". [""Participant" means an injection drug user who exchanges a sterile needle and syringe unit pursuant to the program."] SECTION 3.  Section 325-113, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "[[]§325-113[]]  Operation of the program.  (a)  The program shall be operated for the purpose of: (1)  Preventing the transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus, [the] hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and other [blood borne diseases;] bloodborne infections; and (2)  Providing [injection] drug users with referrals to appropriate health and social services.
