BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that children and families who are referred to the department of human services child welfare services branch undergo a significant amount of trauma. The malama ohana working group created by Act 86, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023, has submitted a report to the legislature that provides recommendations to create transformative changes to the State's existing child welfare system, including having all child welfare services branch staff in the department of human services to receive comprehensive trauma-informed care training as part of developing a trauma-informed system.

SECTION 2. The office of wellness and resilience, in collaboration with the department of human services, shall design, administer, and implement a trauma-informed care organizational assessment and training program, either directly or by contract, for the child welfare services branch of the department of human services.
