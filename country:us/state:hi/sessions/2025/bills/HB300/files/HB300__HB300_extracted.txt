SECTION 26. Any provision of this Act to the contrary notwithstanding, the appropriations made for capital improvement projects authorized under this Act shall not lapse at the end of the fiscal biennium for which the appropriation is made; provided that all appropriations made to be expended in fiscal biennium 2025-2027 which are unencumbered as of June 30, 2028, shall lapse as of that date; provided further that this lapsing date shall not apply to non-general fund appropriations for projects described in section 14 of this Act where such appropriations have been deemed necessary to qualify for federal aid financing and reimbursement and are unencumbered as of June 30, 2032, shall lapse as of that date.
