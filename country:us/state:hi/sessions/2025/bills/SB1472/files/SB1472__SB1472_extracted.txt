Section 1:
SB1472 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1472 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO FUNDING ADJUSTMENTS FOR STATE PROGRAMS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  In prior years, the respective budget acts contained budget special provisions similar to sections 50, 51, and 81 of Act 88, Session Laws of Hawaii 2021, the General Appropriations Act of 2021, which permitted departments to transfer funds between their projects and established a protocol fund as a separate account to be expended at the discretion of the executive head of departments or agencies.  However, Act 164, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023, the General Appropriations Act of 2023, as amended by Act 230, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024, the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2024, does not include the special provisions. Consequently, although funds were appropriated to various state departments for their capital improvement program projects for fiscal biennium 20232025, the omission of the special provisions has caused operational limitations by limiting the ability of departments to supplement allotments and transfer funds between projects to address changing conditions. The purpose of this Act is to address the omission of the special provisions that authorize supplemental allotments and transfer of unrequired balances for capital improvement program projects and that also establish a protocol fund as a separate account to be expended at the discretion of the executive head of departments. SECTION 2. Part VII of Act 164, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023, as amended by Act 230, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024, is further amended by adding a new section to read as follows: "SECTION 15.2.  If the authorized appropriations specified for capital improvement projects listed in this Act are insufficient and where the source of funding is designated as special funds, general obligation bond fund with debt service cost to be paid from special funds, revenue bond funds, or revolving funds, the governor may make supplemental allotments from the special fund or revolving fund responsible for cash or debt service payments for the projects or transfer unrequired balances from other unlapsed projects in this Act or prior appropriation acts that authorized the use of special funds, general obligation bond fund with debt service costs to be paid from special funds, revenue bond funds, or revolving funds; provided that the supplemental allotments shall not be used to increase the scope of the project; provided further that the supplemental allotments shall not impair the ability of the fund to meet the purposes for which it was established." SECTION 3. Part VII of Act 164, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023, as amended by Act 230, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024, is further amended by adding a new section to read as follows: "SECTION 15.3.  If the authorized appropriations specified for capital improvement projects listed in this Act are insufficient and where the source of funding is designated as airport passenger facility charge funds, the governor may make supplemental allotments from the airport revenue fund or airport revenue bond funds, or transfer unrequired balances from other unlapsed projects in this Act or prior appropriation acts that authorized the use of airport passenger facility charge funds; provided that the supplemental allotments shall not be used to increase the scope of the project; provided further that the supplemental allotments shall not impair the ability of the fund to meet the purposes for which it was established; provided further that the governor, at the governor's discretion, may increase the passenger facility charge fund authorization ceiling for the program to accommodate the expenditure of the funds." SECTION 4. Part VII of Act 164, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023, as amended by Act 230, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024, is further amended by adding a new section to read as follows: "SECTION 15.5.  Of the respective operating appropriation authorized in part II of this Act for each principal state department as defined by section 26-4, Hawaii Revised Statutes, the sum of $7,000 in fiscal year 2024-2025 shall be made available in each department to be established as a separate account for a protocol fund to be expended at the discretion of the executive head of the department (i.e., director, chairperson, comptroller, adjutant general, superintendent, president, or attorney general)." SECTION 5. If any portion of this Act or its application to any person, entity, or circumstance is held to be invalid for any reason, then the legislature declares that the remainder of the Act and each and every other provision thereof shall not be affected thereby. If any portion of a specific appropriation is held to be invalid for any reason, the remaining portion shall be expended to fulfill the objective of such appropriation to the extent possible. SECTION 6. New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 7. This Act shall take effect upon its approval. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ BY REQUEST Report Title: Budget Special Provisions Description: Authorizes supplemental allotments and transfer of unrequired balances for capital improvement program projects and establishes a protocol fund for each state principal department.  Effective upon approval.
