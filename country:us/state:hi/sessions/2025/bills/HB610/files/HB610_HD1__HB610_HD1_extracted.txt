Section 1:
HB610 HD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 610 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO COLD CASE INVESTIGATIONS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii has hundreds of unsolved murders, including some cases more than forty years old.  According to the nonprofit organization Project:  Cold Case, the State reported 2,182 homicides between 1965 and 2023, and 728 of those cases remain unsolved. The legislature recognizes that, while each county in the State has a cold case unit, additional resources and personnel may be needed to assist with the investigation of decades-old crimes.  The legislature also recognizes the value in coordinating efforts and sharing information among federal, state, county, tribal, and other agencies. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish a cold case investigation unit within the department of the attorney general to assist federal, state, county, and tribal law enforcement, and other cold case units, in investigating unsolved homicide, missing person, and other cases that have a nexus to the State. SECTION 2.  Chapter 28, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part    .  COLD CASE INVESTIGATION UNIT §28-     Cold case investigation unit. (a)  There shall be established in the department of the attorney general a cold case investigation unit. (b)  The cold case investigation unit shall employ attorneys, investigators, and other personnel as necessary to promote the effective and efficient conduct of the unit's activities.  Except for the attorneys, all other employees of the unit shall be subject to chapter 76. (c)  The purpose of the cold case investigation unit shall be to assist federal, state, county, and tribal law enforcement agencies, and cold case units within the office of a prosecutor, including law enforcement agencies and cold case units in other states, in investigating unsolved cases where the crime took place in this State or where the victim was a resident of this State. (d)  Cases investigated by the cold case investigation unit may include unsolved homicides, sexual offenses, sexually motivated offenses, missing persons, and cases of unidentified remains. (e)  The cold case investigation unit may accept investigation requests and may proactively offer assistance to a law enforcement agency or cold case unit. (f)  For the purpose of this section, "cold case" means a case where all investigative leads have been exhausted, all physical evidence examined, and all witnesses interviewed to the point where the case has been closed for a significant period of time without any active leads." SECTION 3.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $ or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the establishment and operation of a cold case investigation unit within the department of the attorney general. The sums appropriated shall be expended by the department of the attorney general for the purposes of this Act. SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 3000. Report Title: AG; Cold Case; Appropriation Description: Establishes and appropriates funds for a Cold Case Investigation Unit within the Department of the Attorney General.  Effective 7/1/3000.  (HD1) The summary description of legislation appearing on this page is for informational purposes only and is not legislation or evidence of legislative intent.
