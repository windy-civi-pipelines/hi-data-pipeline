A BILL FORAN ACT
RELATING TO ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PORTFOLIO STANDARDS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that, as Hawaii
2 progresses toward achieving its renewable energy and
3 decarbonization goals, energy efficiency remains the most
4 cost-effective way to reduce emissions associated with
5 electricity generation and consumption, while providing
6 financial benefits for customers. The legislature also finds
7 that in 2008, the State, in partnership with the United States
8 Department of Energy, established the Hawaii clean energy
9 initiative, which included goals for energy efficiency.
10 Subsequently, Act 155, Session Laws of Hawaii 2009, codified
11 these energy efficiency goals by establishing an
12 energy-efficiency portfolio standard under section 269-96,
13 Hawaii Revised Statutes, which sets the statewide energy
14 efficiency goal for 2030 at four thousand three hundred gigawatt
15 hours and directs the public utilities commission to establish
16 interim goals for 2015, 2020, and 2025. Now, over fifteen years
17 later, the legislature further finds that it is appropriate to
2025-3380 HB1051 GDI HMSO

5 The purpose of this Act is to extend and further develop
6 the energy-efficiency portfolio standards established and
7 overseen by the public utilities commission.
8 SECTION 2. Section 196-62.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
9 amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows;
10 "(b) As may be applicable, an agency shall consult with
11 the public benefits fee administrator of the commission
12 te] before planning an energy-efficiency measure subject to this
13 section. The agency's proposed energy-efficiency measures shall
14 meet or exceed the public benefits fee administrator's enhanced
15 efficiency levels and requirements to be eligible for the Hawaii
16 green infrastructure loan program. The agency shall coordinate
17 with the public benefits fee administrator throughout the entire
18 project cycle to ensure that energy efficiency is maximized.
19 All supporting documentation required by the public benefits fee
20 administrator shall be provided by the agency to ensure
