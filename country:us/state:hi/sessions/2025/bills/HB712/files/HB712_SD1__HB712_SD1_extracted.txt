HB712 SD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 712 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII S.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO HEALTH. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the federal 340B drug pricing program (340B program) is essential for providing health care access to low-income and uninsured populations. The 340B program requires drug manufacturers to offer significant discounts on outpatient medications to eligible nonprofit hospitals and safety net providers, rural hospitals, community health centers, and Native Hawaiian health centers. The legislature further finds that the 340B program helps stretch limited resources, allowing hospitals to reinvest savings into essential community benefits.  These benefits include financial assistance for low-income patients, free wellness visits, screenings, vaccinations, transportation to appointments, health education classes, and workforce development programs.  In Hawaii, the 340B program also supports unique services such as integrating Native Hawaiian health practices into patient care. The legislature also finds that, despite the 340B program's importance, drug manufacturers have consistently tried to undermine the benefits provided by the program by limiting the use of contract pharmacies by 340B covered entities, which has made it particularly difficult for patients living in rural areas of the State.  Contract pharmacies play a vital role in ensuring that patients can access medications, especially in rural areas where many hospitals do not have an in-house pharmacy.  For example, more than eighty per cent of rural 340B hospitals nationwide rely on contract pharmacies to dispense medication to patients who might otherwise go without essential treatments. The legislature additionally finds that contract pharmacies are crucial in Hawaii, where geographic barriers make access to health care difficult for many residents.  By partnering with pharmacies in those communities, hospitals can ensure that patients in remote areas receive their prescribed medications without the need to travel long distances.  This is especially important for those requiring specialty drugs, which are often available only through specific pharmacy channels. The legislature further finds that the current restrictions imposed by drug manufacturers not only limit a patient's access to affordable medication, but also jeopardize the financial savings that hospitals depend on to provide these critical services.  Hospitals use the difference between the 340B discounted drug price and the reimbursement from insurance to reinvest in their operations, expand services, and support underserved communities.  Without access to contract pharmacies, hospitals face reduced savings, which could result in cutbacks to essential health care programs. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to preserve the integrity of the 340B drug pricing program by prohibiting drug manufacturers from denying, restricting, or prohibiting the acquisition, shipping, or delivery of a 340B drug to a pharmacy under contract with any 340B covered entity in the State. SECTION 2. The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Chapter 340B Drug Discount Program §   -1  Definitions.  As used in this chapter: "340B covered entity" means an entity that participates in the federal 340B drug pricing program authorized by title 42 United States Code section 256b (section 340B of the Public Health Service Act).

(b)  Nothing in this section shall deny, restrict, or prohibit a manufacturer from requiring a 340B covered entity to provide claims information for the manufacturer's 340B drugs.
