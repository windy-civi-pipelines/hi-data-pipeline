THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
A BILL FORAN ACT
RELATING TO POLICE REPORTS.,
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the death of a
2 family member where the incident led to law enforcement
3 initiating an investigation may raise many questions for the
4 surviving family members even years slater. Law enforcement's
5 investigation and the ensuing report may provide some answers
6 and perhaps even closure for a family. The legislature further
7 finds that obtaining this information can be difficult. For one
8 Hawaii family whose son was murdered, it took seventeen years
9 and repeated assistance from a state legislator's office to
10 receive the closing report. For another family whose son was
11 killed during an incident involving law enforcement, the family
12 still has not received a copy of the report more than five years
13 after the incident despite state legislator involvement.
14 The purpose of this Act is to allow surviving immediate
15 family members of deceased persons for whom law enforcement
16 initiated an investigation to receive a copy of the closing

1 report prepared by the investigating police department after a
2 specified period of time.
3 SECTION 2. Chapter 52D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
4 amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated
5 and to read as follows:
6 "§52D- Request for copy of police report by a surviving
7 immediate family member. (a) Each surviving immediate family
8 member of a deceased person for whom law enforcement initiated
9 an investigation shall, upon request, be provided a copy of the
10 closing report prepared by the investigating police department,
11 upon the conclusion of any criminal proceedings related to the
12 incident, the passage of five years after the report has been
13 completed, or the passage of seven years after the underlying
14 incident, whichever occurs first; provided that if the
15 investigation has been reopened in the six months before the
16 request, the investigating police department shall not be
17 required to provide a copy of the report to the family member
18 while the investigation is ongoing; provided further that upon
19 the conclusion of the reopened investigation there shall be no
20 further delay in providing a copy of the report to the
21 requesting family member.
