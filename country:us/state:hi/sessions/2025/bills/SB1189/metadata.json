Expands annual reporting requirements to include the total spending by certain market channels.  Requires certain departments and the University of Hawaii System to include a corrective action plan in their respective reports to the Legislature, should they not meet their benchmarks.  Repeals the separate benchmark for the Department of Education that requires thirty per cent of food served in public schools to consist of locally sourced products by 2030.  Appropriates funds for the establishment of a farm-to-state liaison position within the Office of the Governor."
