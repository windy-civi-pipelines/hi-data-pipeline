Section 1:
SB1189 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1189 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT Relating to Agriculture. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that supporting local agriculture and strengthening local food systems are matters of statewide concern that can improve the resilience of Hawaii's economy, environment, culture, and public health.  The legislature further finds that setting clear and ambitious goals for the purchase of locally grown food ensures that the State plays its role in supporting local farmers and guarantees that revenue derived from local produce remains in the State and feeds local people. Act 175, Session Laws of Hawaii 2021, established a programmatic goal for the department of education to provide a minimum of thirty per cent locally sourced food in Hawaii public school meals by 2030.  Act 176, Session Laws of Hawaii 2021, also established five-year benchmarks ensuring a certain percentage of locally grown produce is purchased by state departments. The legislature also finds that existing goals have established different standards for various state departments.  Specifically, the department of education's programmatic goal to locally source at least thirty per cent of food served in public schools by 2030 is a higher threshold than other state departments. Furthermore, the department of education's progress towards its goal suggests that other state departments should be held to the same standard for the benefit of the people of Hawaii.  The legislature believes that the goals to provide locally sourced food should be consistent across all pertinent state departments to avoid any confusion between departments. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Increase the percentages of local agricultural products that certain state departments and the university of Hawaii system are required to purchase by certain deadlines; (2)  Expand the annual reporting requirements to include total spending by certain market channels; (3)  Require each relevant state department and the university of Hawaii system to include a corrective action plan in its respective report to the legislature, should it not meet its benchmark; (4)  Repeal the separate benchmark for the department of education that requires thirty per cent of food served in public schools to consist of locally sourced products by 2030; and (5)  Appropriate funds for the establishment of a farm-to-state liaison within the office of the governor to facilitate reporting requirements and procurement of locally grown food. SECTION 2.  Section 27-8, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsections (a) and (b) to read as follows: "(a)  The department of education, department of health, department of corrections and rehabilitation, department of defense, and [University] university of Hawaii system shall each ensure that a certain percentage of the food purchased for public schools, youth campuses, public hospitals, public prisons, and any purchases made directly by the [University] university of Hawaii for use in its academic programs, as applicable, is fresh local agricultural products and local value-added, processed, agricultural, or food products, as follows: (1)  By January 1, 2025, fresh local agricultural products and local value-added, processed, agricultural, or food products shall constitute a minimum of ten per cent of the total food purchased during each calendar year, as measured by the per cent of total food cost; (2)  By January 1, 2027, fresh local agricultural products and local value-added, processed, agricultural, or food products shall constitute a minimum of twenty‑five per cent of the total food purchased during each calendar year, as measured by the per cent of total food cost; [(2)] (3)  By January 1, 2030, fresh local agricultural products and local value-added, processed, agricultural, or food products shall constitute a minimum of [eighteen] thirty per cent of the total food purchased during each calendar year, as measured by the per cent of total food cost; [(3)] (4) By January 1, 2035, fresh local agricultural products and local value-added, processed, agricultural, or food products shall constitute a minimum of [twenty-six] thirty-five per cent of the total food purchased during each calendar year, as measured by the per cent of total food cost; [(4)] (5) By January 1, 2040, fresh local agricultural products and local value-added, processed, agricultural, or food products shall constitute a minimum of [thirty-four] forty per cent of the total food purchased during each calendar year, as measured by the per cent of total food cost; [(5)] (6) By January 1, 2045, fresh local agricultural products and local value-added, processed, agricultural, or food products shall constitute a minimum of [forty-two] forty-five per cent of the total food purchased during each calendar year, as measured by the per cent of total food cost; and [(6)] (7) By January 1, 2050, fresh local agricultural products and local value-added, processed, agricultural, or food products shall constitute a minimum of fifty per cent of the total food purchased during each calendar year, as measured by the per cent of total food cost. (b)  The department of education, department of health, department of corrections and rehabilitation, department of defense, and [University] university of Hawaii system shall each submit a report to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular session on progress made toward meeting the benchmarks described in subsection (a), including: (1)  The total cost of food purchased during the calendar year preceding that regular session, or in the case of the department of education, during the school year preceding that regular session; (2)  The percentage of the total cost of food purchased during the calendar year preceding that regular session, accounted for by the total cost of fresh local agricultural products and local value-added, processed, agricultural, or food products purchased, or in the case of the department of education, during the school year preceding that regular session; [and] (3)  Total spending by the following market channels: (A)  Directly from a farmer, fisher, rancher, or food processor; (B)  A food hub or farmer cooperative focused on local sourcing; and (C)  A specialty or broadline distributor; and [(3)] (4) If the department or [University] university of Hawaii system did not meet the relevant benchmark described in subsection (a), an explanation of why the department or [University] university of Hawaii system did not meet that benchmark[.] and a corrective action plan with specific steps and deadlines to meet the benchmark."
