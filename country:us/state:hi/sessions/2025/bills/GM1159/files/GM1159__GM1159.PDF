THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO MEDICAID THIRD PARTY LIABILITY.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION I. The legislature finds that section 202 of
2 division P of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, amended
3 section 1902(a) (25) (I) of the Social Security Act to require
4 state medicaid programs to have state laws in place that bar
5 responsible third-party payers, other than medicare plans, from
6 refusing payment for an item or service solely on the basis that
7 the item or service did not receive prior authorization under
8 the third-party payer's rules. The amendments also modified the
9 requirement for a third-party payer to respond to a state
10 inquiry regarding a health claim that is submitted no later than
11 three years after the provision of the item or service to
12 specify that the third party must respond within sixty days of
13 receiving the inquiry.
14 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to amend state law
15 to comply with the federal requirements amended pursuant to
16 section 202 of division P of the Consolidated Appropriations
17 Act, 2022.
