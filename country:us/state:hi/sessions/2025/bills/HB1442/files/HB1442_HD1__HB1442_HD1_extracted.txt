Section 1:
HB1442 HD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1442 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO OFFICE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that entrepreneurship is vital to the State's economic innovation.  Recent data evaluated an uptick in the rate of entrepreneurship.  In 2020, 4.1 out of every one thousand adults became entrepreneurs in a given month.  However, high fees, complicated requirements, and delayed permitting create barriers to starting a new business in the State. According to the 2019 Bureau of Labor Statistics study, fifty per cent of Hawaii businesses close within the first six years. Over twenty-five per cent of businesses in Hawaii failed in their first year.  This is the highest first-year failure rate in the nation. The purpose of this Act is to establish the office of entrepreneurship and authorize the use of the Hawaii film and creative industries development special fund to fund a program in partnership with the office that creates opportunities in film, media, electronic sports, and creative industries for new businesses.
