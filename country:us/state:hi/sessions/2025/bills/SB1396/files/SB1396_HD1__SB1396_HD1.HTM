SB1396 HD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1396 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 3 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii is experiencing a climate emergency.  The effects of climate change, such as rising temperatures, prolonged droughts, and increasingly destructive and deadly weather events, are felt across the island chain.  These impacts threaten not only our vibrant ecosystems but also the people of Hawaii and the State's economic sustainability.  To ensure the health and safety of Hawaii's lands, waters, and people, as well as its economic viability, successful mitigation of and adaptation to climate change are imperative. The legislature further finds that economic development cannot be separated from environmental stewardship.  Hawaii's economy is deeply reliant on its natural resources, from tourism and agriculture to marine industries and renewable energy.  Degradation of these resources due to climate change and environmental mismanagement will result in significant financial losses across multiple sectors.  By investing in sustainability, the State secures long-term economic stability while preserving its unique landscapes and biodiversity. The legislature further finds that climate resilience must be integrated into all economic planning efforts.  Resiliency measures, such as sustainable land use practices, shoreline protection, and forestry projects, ensure that Hawaii's economy remains robust in the face of climate-related disasters.  Without proactive investment, businesses and communities will continue to suffer financial losses due to increased flooding, wildfires, and extreme weather events. The legislature further finds that investing in Hawaii's environment is, in itself, economic development.  Supporting sustainable practices protects the islands' unique ecosystems while simultaneously fostering economic growth.  This includes funding renewable energy projects, enhancing conservation efforts, and supporting environmental tourism initiatives.  These investments preserve natural resources, reduce carbon footprints, and stimulate economic opportunities, such as job creation in renewable energy sectors and eco-friendly tourism. The legislature further finds that Hawaii has an opportunity to be a global leader in sustainable innovation.  By investing in conservation-focused business models, the State can attract investors and industries that prioritize sustainability.  These initiatives not only protect the environment but also diversify the economy, reducing reliance on tourism and traditional extractive industries. The legislature further finds that Hawaii's cultural heritage and traditions are deeply connected to its natural environment.  The protection and restoration of forests, coral reefs, and coastal ecosystems safeguard the foundation of Native Hawaiian practices and knowledge systems.  Investing in environmental conservation ensures that these traditions can continue to thrive, enriching community well-being and cultural tourism. The legislature further finds that a failure to act now will result in increased costs in the future.  The economic burden of climate inaction will far exceed the cost of proactive investment in mitigation and adaptation strategies.  Infrastructure damage, loss of biodiversity, increased health issues due to heat and pollution, and disruptions to tourism and agriculture will place a heavy financial strain on the State if environmental action is delayed. The legislature further finds that a strong commitment to environmental sustainability enhances Hawaii's reputation as a world-class destination for ecotourism.  Travelers are increasingly seeking destinations that prioritize sustainability, and by investing in conservation efforts, renewable energy, and sustainable tourism practices, Hawaii can maintain its competitive edge in the global tourism market while ensuring the long-term viability of its natural resources. The legislature therefore declares that investment in climate resilience and environmental sustainability is a fundamental component of Hawaii's economic development strategy.  By prioritizing policies and funding mechanisms that support climate action, conservation, and sustainable industries, Hawaii can build a more resilient, prosperous, and environmentally secure future for all residents and visitors. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to increase the transient accommodations tax to create a source of revenue for environmental stewardship, to be implemented through additional funding to the department of land and natural resources. SECTION 2.  Section 237D-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§237D-2  Imposition and rates.  (a)  There is levied and shall be assessed and collected each month a tax of: (1)  Five per cent for the period beginning on January 1, 1987, to June 30, 1994; (2)  Six per cent for the period beginning on July 1, 1994, to December 31, 1998; (3)  7.25 per cent for the period beginning on January 1, 1999, to June 30, 2009; (4)  8.25 per cent for the period beginning on July 1, 2009, to June 30, 2010; [and] (5)  9.25 per cent for the period beginning on July 1, 2010[, and thereafter;] to December 31, 2026; and (6) per cent for the period beginning on January 1, 2027, and thereafter, on the gross rental or gross rental proceeds derived from furnishing transient accommodations.
