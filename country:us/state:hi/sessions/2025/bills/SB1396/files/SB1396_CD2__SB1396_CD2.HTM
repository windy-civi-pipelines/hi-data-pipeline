<div class=WordSection2>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><a name="_Hlk114575812">     SECTION 1.  The
legislature finds that Hawaii is experiencing a climate emergency.  The effects
of climate change, such as rising temperatures, prolonged droughts, and
increasingly destructive and deadly weather events, are felt across the island
chain.  These impacts threaten not only our vibrant ecosystems but also the
people of Hawaii and the State's economic sustainability.  To ensure the health
and safety of Hawaii's lands, waters, and people, as well as its economic
viability, successful mitigation of and adaptation to climate change are
imperative.</a></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature further finds that economic
development cannot be separated from environmental stewardship.  Hawaii's
economy is deeply reliant on its natural resources, from tourism and
agriculture to marine industries and renewable energy.  Degradation of these
resources due to climate change and environmental mismanagement will result in
significant financial losses across multiple sectors.  By investing in
sustainability, the State secures long-term economic stability while preserving
its unique landscapes and biodiversity.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature also finds that climate
resilience must be integrated into all economic planning efforts.  Resiliency
measures, such as sustainable land use practices, shoreline protection, and
forestry projects, ensure that Hawaii's economy remains robust in the face of
climate-related disasters.  Without proactive investment, businesses and
communities will continue to suffer financial losses due to increased flooding,
wildfires, and extreme weather events.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature additionally finds that
investing in Hawaii's environment is, in itself, economic development. 
Furthermore, the legislature finds that as contemplated, the transient
accommodations tax is intended to be applied fully and equitably whenever a
transient accommodation is furnished within the State.  Whereas hotel and
lodging establishments have complied with and pay their due share of transient
accommodations taxes, tax collections on short-term rental operators have
fallen short.  Moreover, there is currently no transient accommodations tax
levied on cruise ships, which in 2024, accounted for 972,820 passenger port
calls at port facilities under the jurisdiction of the department of
transportation.  Supporting sustainable practices protects the islands' unique
ecosystems while simultaneously fostering economic growth.  This support
includes funding renewable energy projects, enhancing conservation efforts, and
promoting environmental tourism initiatives.  These investments preserve
natural resources, reduce carbon footprints, and stimulate economic
opportunities, such as job creation in renewable energy sectors and
eco-friendly tourism.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     In addition, the legislature finds that Hawaii
has an opportunity to be a global leader in sustainable innovation.  By
investing in conservation-focused business models, the State can attract
investors and industries that prioritize sustainability.  These initiatives not
only protect the environment but also diversify the economy, reducing reliance
on tourism and traditional extractive industries.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature further finds that Hawaii's
cultural heritage and traditions are deeply connected to its natural
environment.  The protection and restoration of forests, coral reefs, and
coastal ecosystems safeguard the foundation of Native Hawaiian practices and
knowledge systems.  Investing in environmental conservation ensures that these
traditions can continue to thrive, enriching community well-being and cultural
tourism.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature also finds that a failure to
act now will result in increased costs in the future.  The economic burden of
climate inaction will far exceed the cost of proactive investment in mitigation
and adaptation strategies.  Infrastructure damage, loss of biodiversity,
increased health issues due to heat and pollution, and disruptions to tourism
and agriculture will place a heavy financial strain on the State if
environmental action is delayed.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature additionally finds that a
strong commitment to environmental sustainability enhances Hawaii's reputation
as a world-class destination for ecotourism.  Travelers are increasingly
seeking destinations that prioritize sustainability, and by investing in
conservation efforts, renewable energy, and sustainable tourism practices,
Hawaii can maintain its competitive edge in the global tourism market while
ensuring the long-term viability of its natural resources.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature therefore declares that
investment in climate resilience and environmental sustainability is a
fundamental component of Hawaii's economic development strategy.  By
prioritizing policies and funding mechanisms that support climate action, conservation,
and sustainable industries, Hawaii can build a more resilient, prosperous, and
environmentally secure future for all residents and visitors.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Increase the transient accommodations tax rate
for transient accommodations and resort time shares;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Assess the transient accommodations tax on the
gross receipts derived from cruise fares;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Require the governor to request in the executive
budget or supplemental budget that an amount of general funds that approximates
the additional transient accommodations tax revenue generated by this Act be
expended equally to advance certain climate change mitigation and tourism
projects; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Amend the allowable uses of the special land and
development fund and the portion of transient accommodations tax collections
that are allocated to the special land and development fund.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     SECTION 2.  Chapter 37, Hawaii Revised
Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part IV to be appropriately
designated and to read as follows:</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;<b><u>§37-&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>  <u>Climate
change and tourism destination management; projects; budget request.</u>  </b><u>The
governor shall request, in the budget or the supplemental budget submitted to
the legislature pursuant to section 37-71 or 37-72, that an amount of general
funds that approximates the additional revenue generated by any increase to the
transient accommodations tax rates pursuant to section 237D-2(a)(6) and (c)(4)
beginning on January 1, 2026, and section 237D-2(e) beginning on July 1, 2026,
and by assessment of the transient accommodations tax on gross rental proceeds
derived from cruise fares pursuant to section 237D-2(a) be expended equally to
advance specific projects to: </u></p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     <u>(1)</u>  <u>Protect, manage, and restore the
State's natural resources, including native forests, native plants and animals,
aquatic resources, coastal lands, and freshwater resources;</u></p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     <u>(2)</u>  <u>Increase the resilience of structures
and infrastructure to natural and climate-related disasters, such as hurricanes
and sea level rise, and perform hazard mitigation activities, such as wildfire
and flood mitigation; and </u></p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     <u>(3)</u>  <u>Improve the visitor experience,
mitigate the impacts of tourism on the natural environment, ensure that the
State's natural resources are maintained for future residents and visitors, and
support destination management, such as park improvements and beach improvement,
nourishment, and maintenance projects.</u>&quot;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     SECTION 3.  Section 171-19, Hawaii Revised
Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;<a name="_Hlk88119414">(a)  There is
created in the department a special fund to be designated as the &quot;special
land and development fund&quot;.  Subject to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act
of 1920, as amended, and section 5(f) of the Admission Act of 1959, all
proceeds of sale of public lands, including interest on deferred payments; all
moneys collected under section 171-58 for mineral and water rights; all rents

all moneys collected by the department for the commercial use of public trails
and trail accesses under the jurisdiction of the department; and private
contributions for the management, maintenance, and development of trails and

the legislature for the following purposes:</a></p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  To reimburse the general fund of the State for
advances made that are required to be reimbursed from the proceeds derived from
sales, leases, licenses, or permits of public lands;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  For the planning, development, management,

<p class=1Paragraph>   [<s>(11)</s>] <u>(12)</u>  For other purposes of this
chapter.&quot;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     SECTION 4.  Section 237D-1, Hawaii Revised
Statutes, is amended as follows:</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     1.  By adding three new definitions to be
appropriately inserted and to read:</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;<u>&quot;Cruise fare&quot; means the
total amount paid by a transient for a cruise ship cabin on a cruise ship,
inclusive of any mandatory fees imposed by a cruise ship operator, owner, or
representative thereof on a transient for the use of shipboard services,
facilities, meals, and onboard entertainment, but does not include optional
charges for shipboard services, meals, excursions, and onboard entertainment
beyond the mandatory fee amount.</u></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <u>&quot;Cruise ship&quot; means any ship that
docks at any port in the State that charges a fee for and provides cruise ship
cabins to transients.</u></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <u>&quot;Cruise ship cabin&quot; means an
accommodation or living quarter on a cruise ship that is provided to a transient.</u>&quot;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     2.  By amending the definition of &quot;gross
rental&quot; or &quot;gross rental proceeds&quot; to read:</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Gross rental&quot; or &quot;gross rental
proceeds&quot; means the gross receipts, cash or accrued, of the taxpayer
received as compensation for the furnishing of transient accommodations or
entering into arrangements to furnish transient accommodations and the value
proceeding or accruing from the furnishing of transient accommodations or
entering into arrangements to furnish transient accommodations, including
resort fees without any deductions on account of the cost of property or
services sold, the cost of materials used, labor cost, taxes, royalties,
interest, discounts, or any other expenses whatsoever.  <u>&quot;Gross
rental&quot; or &quot;gross rental proceeds&quot; includes the gross receipts
derived from cruise fares.</u>  Every taxpayer shall be presumed to be dealing
on a cash basis unless the taxpayer proves to the satisfaction of the
department of taxation that the taxpayer is dealing on an accrual basis and the
taxpayer's books are so kept, or unless the taxpayer employs or is required to
employ the accrual basis for the purposes of the tax imposed by chapter&nbsp;237
for any taxable year in which event the taxpayer shall report the taxpayer's
gross income for the purposes of this chapter on the accrual basis for the same
period.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The words &quot;gross rental&quot; or &quot;gross
rental proceeds&quot; shall not be construed to include the amounts of taxes
imposed by chapter 237 or this chapter on operators of transient
accommodations, transient accommodations brokers, travel agencies, and tour
packagers and passed on, collected, and received from the consumer as part of
the receipts received as compensation for the furnishing of transient
accommodations or entering into arrangements to furnish transient
accommodations.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Where transient accommodations are furnished
through arrangements made by a transient accommodations broker, travel agency,
or tour packager at noncommissionable negotiated contract rates and the gross
income is divided between the operator of transient accommodations on the one
hand and the transient accommodations broker, travel agency, or tour packager
on the other hand, the tax imposed by this chapter shall apply to each operator
and transient accommodations broker, travel agency, or tour packager with respect
to that person's respective portion of the proceeds and no more.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     For purposes of this definition, where the
operator maintains a schedule of rates for identifiable groups of individuals,
such as kamaainas, upon which the accommodations are leased, let, or rented,
gross rental or gross rental proceeds means the receipts collected and received
based upon the scheduled rates and recorded as receipts in its books and
records.&quot;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     SECTION 5.  Section 237D-2, Hawaii Revised
Statutes, is amended as follows:</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     1.  By amending subsection (a) to read:</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;(a)  There is levied and shall be
assessed and collected each month a tax of:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Five per cent for the period beginning on January
1, 1987, to June 30, 1994;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Six per cent for the period beginning on July 1,
1994, to December 31, 1998;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  7.25 per cent for the period beginning on January
1, 1999, to June 30, 2009;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  8.25 per cent for the period beginning on July 1,
2009, to June 30, 2010; [<s>and</s>]</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  9.25 per cent for the period beginning on July 1,
2010[<s>, and thereafter;</s>] <u>to December 31, 2025; and</u></p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     <u>(6)</u>  <u>Ten per cent for the period beginning
on January 1, 2026, and thereafter,</u></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>on the gross rental or gross rental proceeds derived
from furnishing transient accommodations[<s>.</s>]<u>; provided that an
operator of a cruise ship shall be assessed and pay a tax of eleven per cent
under this subsection on all gross rental proceeds derived from cruise fares
prorated by the percentage of days docked at any port in the State in
