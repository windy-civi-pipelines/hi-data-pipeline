SB1396 HD3 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1396 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 3 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 3 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii is experiencing a climate emergency.  The effects of climate change, such as rising temperatures, prolonged droughts, and increasingly destructive and deadly weather events, are felt across the island chain.  These impacts threaten not only our vibrant ecosystems but also the people of Hawaii and the State's economic sustainability.  To ensure the health and safety of Hawaii's lands, waters, and people, as well as its economic viability, successful mitigation of and adaptation to climate change are imperative. The legislature further finds that economic development cannot be separated from environmental stewardship.  Hawaii's economy is deeply reliant on its natural resources, from tourism and agriculture to marine industries and renewable energy.  Degradation of these resources due to climate change and environmental mismanagement will result in significant financial losses across multiple sectors.  By investing in sustainability, the State secures long-term economic stability while preserving its unique landscapes and biodiversity. The legislature also finds that climate resilience must be integrated into all economic planning efforts.  Resiliency measures, such as sustainable land use practices, shoreline protection, and forestry projects, ensure that Hawaii's economy remains robust in the face of climate-related disasters.  Without proactive investment, businesses and communities will continue to suffer financial losses due to increased flooding, wildfires, and extreme weather events. The legislature additionally finds that investing in Hawaii's environment is, in itself, economic development. Furthermore, the legislature finds that as contemplated, the transient accommodations tax is intended to be applied fully and equitably whenever a transient accommodation is furnished within the State.  Whereas hotel and lodging establishments have complied with and pay their due share of transient accommodations taxes, tax collections on short-term rental operators have fallen short.  Moreover, there is currently no transient accommodations tax levied on cruise ships, which in 2024, accounted for 972,820 passenger port calls at port facilities under the jurisdiction of the department of transportation.  Supporting sustainable practices protects the islands' unique ecosystems while simultaneously fostering economic growth. This support includes funding renewable energy projects, enhancing conservation efforts, and promoting environmental tourism initiatives.  These investments preserve natural resources, reduce carbon footprints, and stimulate economic opportunities, such as job creation in renewable energy sectors and eco-friendly tourism. In addition, the legislature finds that Hawaii has an opportunity to be a global leader in sustainable innovation.  By investing in conservation-focused business models, the State can attract investors and industries that prioritize sustainability.  These initiatives not only protect the environment but also diversify the economy, reducing reliance on tourism and traditional extractive industries. The legislature further finds that Hawaii's cultural heritage and traditions are deeply connected to its natural environment. The protection and restoration of forests, coral reefs, and coastal ecosystems safeguard the foundation of Native Hawaiian practices and knowledge systems.  Investing in environmental conservation ensures that these traditions can continue to thrive, enriching community well-being and cultural tourism. The legislature also finds that a failure to act now will result in increased costs in the future.  The economic burden of climate inaction will far exceed the cost of proactive investment in mitigation and adaptation strategies. Infrastructure damage, loss of biodiversity, increased health issues due to heat and pollution, and disruptions to tourism and agriculture will place a heavy financial strain on the State if environmental action is delayed. The legislature additionally finds that a strong commitment to environmental sustainability enhances Hawaii's reputation as a world-class destination for ecotourism.  Travelers are increasingly seeking destinations that prioritize sustainability, and by investing in conservation efforts, renewable energy, and sustainable tourism practices, Hawaii can maintain its competitive edge in the global tourism market while ensuring the long-term viability of its natural resources. The legislature therefore declares that investment in climate resilience and environmental sustainability is a fundamental component of Hawaii's economic development strategy.  By prioritizing policies and funding mechanisms that support climate action, conservation, and sustainable industries, Hawaii can build a more resilient, prosperous, and environmentally secure future for all residents and visitors. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Increase the transient accommodations tax; (2)  Amend the allowable uses of the special land and development fund and the portion of transient accommodations tax collections that are allocated to the special land and development fund; and (3)  Assess the transient accommodations tax on cruise ship cabins based on the total time the cruise ship is docked at any port in the State, to create a source of revenue for environmental stewardship, climate and hazard mitigation, and sustainable tourism, to be implemented through additional funding to the department of land and natural resources. SECTION 2.  Section 171-19, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows: "(a)  There is created in the department a special fund to be designated as the "special land and development fund".  Subject to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920, as amended, and section 5(f) of the Admission Act of 1959, all proceeds of sale of public lands, including interest on deferred payments; all moneys collected under section 171-58 for mineral and water rights; all rents from leases, licenses, and permits derived from public lands; all moneys collected from lessees of public lands within industrial parks; all fees, fines, and other administrative charges collected under this chapter and chapter 183C; a portion of the highway fuel tax collected under chapter 243; a portion of the transient accommodations tax under chapter 237D; all moneys collected by the department for the commercial use of public trails and trail accesses under the jurisdiction of the department; and private contributions for the management, maintenance, and development of trails and accesses shall be set apart in the fund and shall be used only as authorized by the legislature for the following purposes: (1)  To reimburse the general fund of the State for advances made that are required to be reimbursed from the proceeds derived from sales, leases, licenses, or permits of public lands; (2)  For the planning, development, management, operations, or maintenance of all lands and improvements under the control and management of the board pursuant to title 12, including but not limited to permanent or temporary staff positions who may be appointed without regard to chapter 76; (3)  To repurchase any land, including improvements, in the exercise by the board of any right of repurchase specifically reserved in any patent, deed, lease, or other documents or as provided by law; (4)  For the payment of all appraisal fees; provided that all fees reimbursed to the board shall be deposited in the fund; (5)  For the payment of publication notices as required under this chapter; provided that all or a portion of the expenditures may be charged to the purchaser or lessee of public lands or any interest therein under rules adopted by the board; (6)  For the management, maintenance, and development of trails and trail accesses under the jurisdiction of the department; (7)  For the payment to private land developers who have contracted with the board for development of public lands under section 171-60; (8)  For the payment of debt service on revenue bonds issued by the department, including revenue bonds issued for the purposes of section 237D-6.5(b)(4), and the establishment of debt service and other reserves deemed necessary by the board; (9)  To reimburse the general fund for debt service on general obligation bonds issued to finance departmental projects, including projects under section 237D-6.5(b)(4), where the bonds are designated to be reimbursed from the special land and development fund; (10)  For the protection, planning, management, and regulation of water resources under chapter 174C; [and] (11)  For the purposes of section 237D-6.5(b)(4); and [(11)] (12)  For other purposes of this chapter."
