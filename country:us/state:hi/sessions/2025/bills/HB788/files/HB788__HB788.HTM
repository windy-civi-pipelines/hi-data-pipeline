Section 1:
HB788 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 788 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to electric vehicle batteries. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that electric vehicle sales in the State continues to grow, accounting for approximately fifteen per cent of all new car sales in 2024. As electric vehicle usage increases, more electric vehicle batteries will enter the waste stream.  Proper recycling and disposal practices are needed to ensure that electric vehicle batteries do not contribute to environmental harm. The purpose of this Act is to establish a working group to examine how to maximize the recycling and reuse of electric vehicle batteries and recommend electric vehicle battery management practices. SECTION 2.  (a) There is established within the Hawaii state energy office an electric vehicle battery recycling and reuse working group to examine how to maximize the recycling and reuse of electric vehicle batteries and recommend electric vehicle battery management practices. (b)  The working group shall: (1)  Develop a plan for best management practices for the recycling, reuse, or repurposing of electric vehicle batteries; (2)  Coordinate with any other organization, working group, or relevant entity within or outside of the State that has similar objectives as this working group, or is researching the recycling, reuse, or repurposing of electric vehicle batteries; and (3)  Develop policy recommendations for the legislature to implement based on the working group's findings. (c)  The working group shall consist of: (1)  The chief energy officer, or the chief energy officer's designee, who shall serve as the co-chair of the working group; (2)  The director of health, or the director's designee, who shall serve as the co-chair of the working group; and (3)  One representative from the department of environmental services of the city and county of Honolulu.
