C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO THE DRUG AND ALCOHOL TOXICOLOGY TESTING LABORATORY.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the establishment of
2 a state laboratory for drug and alcohol testing is crucial to
3 ensuring the health and safety of the State's communities. This
4 effort requires close coordination between the department of
5 health and county governments to create a facility that can
6 deliver timely, accurate, and reliable toxicology testing
7 services statewide. The department of transportation recognizes
8 the critical importance of implementing consistent standards and
9 practices across the State to ensure the laboratory meets the
10 needs of all counties effectively. To achieve this, additional
11 time is necessary to build, equip, and establish the laboratory,
12 along with the administrative framework to support its
13 operations.
14 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to extend the
15 timeline for the establishment and maintenance of the drug and
16 alcohol toxicology testing laboratory.
