A BILL FORAN ACT
RELATING TO THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the State offers a
2 unique opportunity for job growth and economic development
3 through its important geographic location. During fiscal year
4 2022, the State received almost $9 billion in defense spending.
5 Furthermore, from fiscal years 2018 to 2022, the number of
6 defense-related jobs increased by about ten thousand. Many of
7 these jobs are in the areas of information technology,
8 cybersecurity, intelligence, and data science, providing
9 good-paying jobs for the State's local economy. To meet the
10 growing demand for jobs in these fields, the State should
11 utilize and invest in the expertise offered at the business
12 administration program at the university of Hawaii West Oahu.
13 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to appropriate
14 funds to the university of Hawaii to hire faculty at the
15 business administration program at the university of Hawaii West
16 Oahu for workforce development to support the defense sector of
17 the State's economy.
