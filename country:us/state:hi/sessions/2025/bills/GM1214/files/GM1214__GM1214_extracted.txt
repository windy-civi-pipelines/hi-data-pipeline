STATE OF HAWAII h.D.2
G.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO VIRAL HEPATITIS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the department of
2 health reports that hepatitis B and C viral infections are
3 associated with earlier deaths and higher death rates in Hawaii.
4 From 2000 to 2020, yearly mortality rates associated with
5 hepatitis B were higher in Hawaii compared to the entire United
6 States, with death rates three times higher in 2019 alone.
7 These death rates were notably higher among Asian and Pacific
8 Islander residents compared to the rest of the State.
9 Furthermore, from 2018 to 2021, eighty-eight per cent of Hawaii
10 residents with hepatitis C died before reaching average life
11 expectancy for the rest of the State. These deaths continue to
12 occur in Hawaii despite the availability of effective tools to
13 prevent, treat, and even cure these infections. To address the
14 burden of viral hepatitis in Hawaii, the department of health
15 has successfully leveraged community and state partnerships to
16 convene the "Hep Free 2030: The Hawai‘i Hepatitis Elimination
17 Strategy 2020-2030." The coalition has made progress towards

H.D. 2
C.D. 1
1 eliminating viral hepatitis by focusing on five priority areas:
2 awareness and education; access to services; advocacy at all
3 levels; equity in everything; and data for decision-making. In
4 2021, the legislature adopted House Concurrent Resolution
5 No. 59, H.D. 1, which found that continued coordination and
6 ongoing efforts are needed to further implement the statewide
7 strategy to eliminate viral hepatitis types A, B, and C in
8 Hawaii. However, there has been no state funding dedicated to
9 the prevention, management, and treatment of viral hepatitis
10 infections.
11 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to expand the
12 State's capacity to address preventable morbidity and mortality
13 from viral hepatitis among Hawaii residents through established
14 and innovative public health interventions.
15 SECTION 2. Chapter 325, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
16 amended by adding four new sections to part V to be
17 appropriately designated and to read as follows:
18 "§325- Definitions. As used in this part, "department"
19 means the department of health.
20 §325- Hepatitis prevention program. (a) The department
