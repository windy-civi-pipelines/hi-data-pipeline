WHEREAS, the Real Estate Commission of the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs has broad authority to allow for the administration of the real estate salesperson's examination in the Japanese language and to issue licenses limited to the sale of timeshare products in Hawaii to those who pass the full real estate salesperson's examination given in Japanese; and WHEREAS, based on the prior experience of timeshare operators in other jurisdictions, a potentially higher passage rate for Japanese-speaking applicants could result in a rise in the sale of timeshare products to Japanese-speaking visitors and an increase in visitors from Japan; and WHEREAS, in contrast to visitors who stay in hotels, timeshare owners are more likely to become involved in the local community and consistently support the local economy, as they return to Hawaii multiple times and on a regular basis; and WHEREAS, the timeshare industry desires to cultivate greater Japanese involvement in the Hawaii timeshare industry; however, it has found it difficult to hire a sufficient number of licensed salespersons to meet the demand of the Japanese market and facilitate an increase in the number of Japanese visitors to Hawaii; and WHEREAS, it is not unusual to offer written examinations required for licenses to be given in languages other than English; and WHEREAS, for instance, the written examination for the Hawaii driver's license is offered in multiple languages, such as Chinese, Chuukese, Hawaiian, Ilocano, Japanese, Korean, Marshallese, Samoan, Spanish, Tagalog, Tongan, and Vietnamese, in order to accommodate Hawaii's linguistically diverse community and address concerns regarding discrimination; and WHEREAS, pursuant to the statutory powers and authority granted to the Real Estate Commission under chapter 467, Hawaii Revised Statutes, the Commission could implement this proposal without any statutory changes; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, that the Real Estate Commission is strongly urged to allow for the administration of the real estate salesperson's examination in the Japanese language for purposes of issuing a full real estate salesperson's license, limited to the sale of timeshare products in Hawaii, to promote the sale of these products to Japanese-speaking visitors and enhance Japan's involvement in and support of the Hawaii tourism industry; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Real Estate Commission is requested to use its existing authority under chapter 467, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to make these Japanese-language examinations available; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Director of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, Chairperson of the Real Estate Commission, and Supervising Executive Officer of the Real Estate Commission.
