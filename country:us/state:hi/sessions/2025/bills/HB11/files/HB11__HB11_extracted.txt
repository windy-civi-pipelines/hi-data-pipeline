HB11 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 11 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to health care. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that certificate of need programs are state-level regulatory programs that require approval from a state health planning and development agency for construction, expansion, and major capital expenditures by health care facilities and services.  Hawaii's certificate of need law, codified in part V of chapter 323D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, was established in 1975 in response to the National Health Planning and Resources Development Act of 1974, which conditioned the award of federal public health service grants upon a state's adoption of such regulatory measures. In 1987, the federal mandate and funding provisions of National Health Planning and Resources Development Act were repealed and since then, fifteen states and the District of Columbia have dropped their certificate of need programs while several other states have since narrowed the application of their certificate of need laws to apply to only certain types of facilities. The legislature further finds that Hawaii law requires the state health planning and development agency to approve a certificate of need for the construction, expansion, alteration, conversion, development, initiation, or modification of all health care facilities or health care services in the State.  The law is intended to provide a coordinated system that links statewide planning for health services with facilities development.  Certificate of need programs are seen as an unnecessary barrier to entry into the health care market, doing more harm than good for reasons such as: (1)  Restricting free and open competition; (2)  Stifling market innovation and improvements in the delivery of better health care by limiting competition; (3)  Limiting consumer choice, which results in stifling price competition among existing health care facilities; (4)  Diminishing quality performance among health care providers; (5)  Removing incentives for established providers to reduce costs, and not achieving its main objective of controlling health care costs; and (6)  Inconsistency in the administration of the program. The legislature additionally finds that the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the urgent need for reform of the certificate of need program.  Without the restrictive burden of a certificate of need, providers will be able to determine whether new facilities should be built or existing facilities should be expanded.  Additionally, in a recent study of states the Mercatus Center found that after five years, hospital charges were 5.5 per cent lower than they would have been with certificate of need laws in effect. The legislature believes that national health care reform and other changes taking place in the health care marketplace make it appropriate to examine the relevance of Hawaii's certificate of need program and its effects on health care access, quality, and costs. Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to repeal Hawaii's certificate of need requirement for all health care facilities and services except nursing homes, hospices, intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities, and ambulance service providers. SECTION 2.  Section 323D-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended as follows: 1.  By amending the definition of "health care facility" and "health care service" to read: ""Health care facility" and "health care service" include any [program, institution, place, building, or agency, or portion thereof, private or public, other than federal facilities or services, whether organized for profit or not, used, operated, or designed to provide medical diagnosis, treatment, nursing, rehabilitative, or preventive care to any person or persons.  The terms include, but are not limited to, health care facilities and health care services commonly referred to as hospitals, facilities that provide inpatient medical care and other related services for surgery or acute medical conditions or injuries (usually for a short-term illness or condition), extended care and rehabilitation centers, nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities, intermediate care facilities, hospices for the terminally ill that require licensure or certification by the department of health, kidney disease treatment centers including freestanding hemodialysis units, outpatient clinics, organized ambulatory health care facilities, emergency care facilities and centers, home health agencies, health maintenance organizations, and others providing similarly organized services regardless of nomenclature.] nursing home, hospice, intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities, or ambulance service provider." 2.

The certificate of need program mandated under part V shall serve this function.  The state agency shall promote the sharing of facilities or services by health care providers whenever possible to achieve economies and shall restrict unusual or unusually costly services to individual facilities or providers where appropriate; (2)  Serve as staff to and provide technical assistance and advice to the statewide council and the subarea councils in the preparation, review, and revision of the state health services and facilities plan; (3)  Conduct the health planning activities of the State in coordination with the subarea councils, implement the state health services and facilities plan, and determine the statewide health needs of the State after consulting with the statewide council; and (4)  Administer the state certificate of need program pursuant to part V." SECTION 4.  Section 323D-15, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§323D-15  State health services and facilities plan.  There shall be a state health services and facilities plan which shall address the health care facility and service needs of the State[, including inpatient care, health care facilities, and special needs].

SECTION 5.  Section 323D-18, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§323D-18  Information required of providers.  [Providers of health] Health care facilities doing business in the State shall submit [such] statistical and other reports of information related to health and health care [as] that the state agency finds necessary to the performance of its functions.  The information deemed necessary includes but is not limited to: (1)  Information regarding changes in the class of usage of the bed complement of a health care facility under section 323D-54(9); (2)  Implementation of services under section 323D-54; (3)  Projects that are wholly dedicated to meeting the State's obligations under court orders, including consent decrees, under section 323D-54(10); (4)  Replacement of existing equipment with an updated equivalent under section 323D-54(11); (5)  Primary care clinics under the expenditure thresholds under section 323D-54(12); and (6)  Equipment and services related to that equipment, that are primarily intended for research purposes as opposed to usual and customary diagnostic and therapeutic care." SECTION 6.  Section 323D-22, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows: "(a)  Each subarea health planning council shall review, seek public input, and make recommendations relating to [health] the planning of health care facilities and health care services for the geographical subarea it serves. In addition, the subarea health planning councils shall: (1)  Identify and recommend to the state agency and the council the data needs and special concerns of the respective subareas with respect to the preparation of the state plan[.]; (2)  Provide specific recommendations to the state agency and the council regarding the highest priorities for health services and resources development[.]; (3)  Review the state health services and facilities plan as it relates to the respective subareas and make recommendations to the state agency and the council[.]; (4)  Advise the state agency in the administration of the certificate of need program for their respective subareas[.]; (5)  Advise the state agency on the cost of reimbursable expenses incurred in the performance of their functions for inclusion in the state agency budget[.]; (6)  Advise the state agency in the performance of its specific functions[.]; (7)  Perform other [such] functions as agreed upon by the state agency and the respective subarea councils[.]; and (8) [Each subarea health planning council shall recommend] Recommend for gubernatorial appointment at least one person from its membership to be on the statewide council." SECTION 7.  Section 323D-49, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§323D-49  Certificates of need; licenses and permits.  [(a)]  No permit or license shall be issued by any county or state officer for the development, construction, expansion, alteration, conversion, initiation, or modification of a health care facility or health care service, [other than an existing hospital,] or for the operation of a new health care facility or health care service unless there is submitted in connection with the application for such permit or license a current certificate of need issued by the state agency or a statement issued by the state agency that the health care facility or health care service is not required to hold a certificate of need under this part.
