HB753 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 753 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to the household and dependent care services tax credit. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the average cost of full-time child care in Hawaii currently exceeds $13,000 per year for working families.  The rising cost of child care should be reflected in the income tax credits allowed for expenses for household and dependent care services, which include child care services.  Such services facilitate the academic and social development of young children and allow parents to obtain stable employment, thereby increasing the economic well-being of the family as a whole. The legislature further finds that Act 163, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023 (Act 163), partially strengthened the household and dependent care services tax credit by raising the amount of the employment-related expenses incurred during any taxable year that may be taken into account for the purposes of the credit. Yet, Act 163 did not increase the maximum percentage of household and dependent care expenses that may be claimed for the purposes of the tax credit.  Without adjusting the maximum percentage of expenses that taxpayers can claim, the increases to the claimable amounts of the household and dependent care services tax credit provide limited benefit to working families. The legislature additionally finds that in statements to the media, public officials said that they intended to provide approximately $47,000,000 of financial relief to working families through the household and dependent care services tax credit under Act 163.  The department of taxation later estimated the cost of the provisions of Act 163 relating to the household and dependent care services tax credit at only about $9,500,000.  This discrepancy can be rectified by amending the tax credit to increase the percentage of child and dependent care expenses for which the credit may be applied, thereby fulfilling the legislature's original intent for Act 163. The purpose of this Act is to increase the taxpayer's applicable percentage of employment-related expenses that may be claimed for the household and dependent care services tax credit. SECTION 2.  Section 235-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new definition to be appropriately inserted and to read as follows: ""Cost-of-living adjustment factor" means a factor calculated by adding 1.0 to the quotient of the percent change in the Urban Hawaii Consumer Price Index for all items divided by one hundred, as published by the United States Department of Labor, from July of the preceding calendar year to July of the current calendar year; provided that if the Urban Hawaii Consumer Price Index is discontinued, the Chained Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, as published by the United States Department of Labor, shall be used to calculate the cost-of-living adjustment factor." SECTION 3.  Section 235-55.6, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§235-55.6 Expenses for household and dependent care services necessary for gainful employment.  (a)  Allowance of credit. (1)  In general.  For each resident taxpayer, who files an individual income tax return for a taxable year, and who is not claimed or is not otherwise eligible to be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer for federal or Hawaii state individual income tax purposes, who maintains a household which includes as a member one or more qualifying individuals (as defined in subsection (b)(1)), there shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the employment-related expenses (as defined in subsection (b)(2)) paid by the individual during the taxable year. If the tax credit claimed by a resident taxpayer exceeds the amount of income tax payment due from the resident taxpayer, the excess of the credit over payments due shall be refunded to the resident taxpayer; provided that tax credit properly claimed by a resident individual who has no income tax liability shall be paid to the resident individual; and provided further that no refunds or payment on account of the tax credit allowed by this section shall be made for amounts less than $1.
