(b)  Coverage under this section shall be provided in a manner that limits disruptions in care, including the need for multiple biopsies. (c)  If a policy restricts coverage under this section, the patient and prescribing health care provider shall be provided access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient process for requesting an exception.  The process for requesting an exception shall also be readily accessible on the insurer's website. (d)  Coverage under this section may be subject to the copayment, deductible, and coinsurance provisions of a policy for accident and health or sickness insurance; provided that the terms shall be no less favorable than the copayment, deductible, and coinsurance provisions for other medical services covered by the policy. (e)  Within calendar year 2026, and in no case later than December 31, 2026, each insurer shall provide written notice to its policyholders regarding the coverage required by this section.  The notice shall be prominently featured in any literature or correspondence sent annually to policyholders. (f)  This section shall not apply to limited benefit health insurance as provided in section 431:10A-607. (g)  For the purposes of this section: "Biomarker" means a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a specific therapeutic intervention, including known gene-drug interactions for mediations being considered for use or already being administered.  Biomarkers include gene mutations, gene characteristics, and protein expression. "Biomarker testing" means the analysis of a patient's tissue, blood, or other biospecimen for the presence of a biomarker.  Biomarker testing includes single-analyte tests; multi-plex panel tests; protein expression; and whole exome, whole genome, and whole transcriptome sequencing. "Clinical practice guidelines" means guidelines that establish standards of care informed by a systemic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and risks of alternative care options and that include recommendations intended to optimize patient care.  Clinical practice guidelines are developed by independent organizations or medical professional societies using a transparent methodology and reporting structure and with a conflict-of-interest policy. "Consensus statements" means statements developed by an independent multidisciplinary panel of experts using a transparent methodology and reporting structure and with a conflict-of-interest policy.  Consensus statements are focused on specific clinical circumstances and are based on the best available evidence for the purpose of optimizing the outcomes of clinical care."
