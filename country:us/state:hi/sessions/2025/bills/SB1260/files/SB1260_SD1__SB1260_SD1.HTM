(b)  The amount of the tax credit shall be equal to per cent of the qualified expenses of the qualified taxpayer, up to a maximum of $25,000 per taxable year. (c)  In the case of a partnership, S corporation, estate, or trust, the tax credit allowable shall be for qualified expenses incurred by the entity for the taxable year.  The expenses upon which the tax credit is computed shall be determined at the entity level.  Distribution and share of credit shall be determined by rule. (d)  The total amount of tax credits allowed under this section shall not exceed $1,000,000 for all qualified taxpayers in any taxable year; provided that any qualified taxpayer who is not eligible to claim the credit in a taxable year due to the $1,000,000 cap having been exceeded for that taxable year shall be eligible to claim the credit in the subsequent taxable year until exhausted within five consecutive taxable years of the filing of the initial claim for the credit under this section. (e)  Every qualified taxpayer, before March 31 of each year in which qualified expenses were incurred by the qualified taxpayer in the previous taxable year, shall submit a written, certified statement to the chairperson of the board of agriculture identifying: (1)  Qualified expenses incurred in the previous taxable year; and (2)  The amount of the tax credit claimed by the qualified taxpayer pursuant to this section, if any, in the previous taxable year.

(h)  If the tax credit under this section exceeds the qualified taxpayer's net income tax liability, the excess of the credit over liability may be used as a credit against the qualified taxpayer's net income tax liability in subsequent years until exhausted within five consecutive taxable years of the filing of the initial claim for the credit under this section.  All claims for the tax credit under this section, including amended claims, shall be filed on or before the end of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the credit may be claimed.  Failure to comply with the foregoing provision shall constitute a waiver of the right to claim the credit. (i)  For the purposes of this section: "Agroecological and climate-smart farming practices" means sustainable farming practices that promote soil quality and health; fertility management for organic and conventional farming systems; preventative and biological pest management; crop rotation, cover cropping, and polycultures; and the conservation or restoration of native and Polynesian-introduced plants to agricultural landscapes.  These practices shall include but not be limited to Native Hawaiian agricultural systems, such as loi kalo wetland cultivation, dryland field systems, agroforestry, and loko ia fishponds.
