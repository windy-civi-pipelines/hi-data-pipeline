HB280 HD3 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 280 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 3 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE COMMUNITY OUTREACH COURT. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the worsening problem of homelessness on Oahu has led to residents being cited or arrested for drinking liquor in public, being in public parks after hours, trespassing, illegal camping on sidewalks and other public areas, and other nonviolent or status offenses.  Many of those cited are unable to attend court or have misplaced their paperwork due to the transient and unstable nature of homelessness.  When a person fails to appear for court and has no known address, courts are left with no option but to issue a bench warrant. Under Act 55, Session Laws of Hawaii 2017, the judiciary, office of the public defender, and department of the prosecuting attorney of the city and county of Honolulu established a community court outreach project.  The goal of the community court outreach project is to assist nonviolent offenders who are charged with offenses that disproportionately impact the homeless community by making court attendance more accessible through holding court in community locations where offenders are found, resolving any active charges, and utilizing alternative sentences such as community service work in cases where prior court judgments could not be satisfied and offenders lack the present ability to pay fines and fees.  By resolving these cases, the participants are in a better position to obtain basic necessities such as jobs, income assistance, and housing.  The community court outreach project social worker assesses offenders for participation in programs deemed appropriate based upon an offender's need for mental health services, substance abuse treatment, sustenance, shelter, or other appropriate available social services and assists the offenders in obtaining and voluntarily participating in these referred services. The legislature finds that the community court outreach project has been successful. Since its inception, the project has addressed over ten thousand cases, recalled over nine hundred bench warrants, lifted more than seven thousand driver license stoppers, and provided assistance to over six hundred participants at community-based sites in the judicial districts where participants may live or have access to mental health services, substance abuse treatment, sustenance, shelter, or other social services and who have completed more than seven thousand community service work hours. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to permanently establish and appropriate funds for the community outreach court as a division of the district court of the first circuit. SECTION 2. The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Chapter COMMUNITY OUTREACH COURT §   -1  Definitions.  As used in this chapter: "Community outreach court" or "court" means a division of the district court of the first circuit that shall address cases brought before it for nonviolent, nonfelony defendants in which the prosecuting attorney and public defender have reached plea agreements.
