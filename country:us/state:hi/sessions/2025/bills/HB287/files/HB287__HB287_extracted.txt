Section 1:
HB287 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 287 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT proposing amendments to article x, section 2 and article xviii, section 12, of the constitution of the state of hawaii to establish local elected school boards. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii is the only state in the nation where a single department of education and a single statewide board run all public schools.  This centralized school system  a holdover from the plantation era - comes with several drawbacks.  Every public school is required to follow the same set of state regulations, guidelines, and testing apparatus.  This system leaves little room for flexibility in introducing new training approaches or trying new instructional programming. As a result, teachers are unable to adjust pedagogy to individual learning styles. The legislature finds that entrusting the governance of public schools to their communities to oversee local school districts results in a well-functioning education system.  Additionally, elected board members can address the unique education-related needs of their respective districts for better tailored improvements in public education.  Decentralization in education significantly improves repetition rates, dropout rates, graduation rates, and test scores.  Localized school boards serve as the communitys voice and directly address the distinct needs of each district.  Focused efforts on the school-level translates to overall improved student achievement. The purpose of this Act is to amend the Constitution of the State of Hawaii to provide for multiple, local school boards, that are populated with elected board members, serving no more than twelve years as a member, in place of the current Board of Education. SECTION 2.  Article X, section 2, of the Hawaii Constitution is amended to read as follows: "BOARD OF EDUCATION Section 2.  There shall be [a] five [board] boards of education[. The governor shall nominate and, by and with the advice and consent of the senate, appoint the members of the board of education, as provided by law.] composed of members who shall be elected in a nonpartisan manner by qualified voters, as provided by law.  No person shall serve as a member for more than twelve years in their lifetime.  One board shall cover the entire state and be composed of members who reside anywhere within the state.  The four other boards shall each cover one county area.  Each county school board district shall be divided into departmental school districts, as may be provided by law.  There shall be at least one member residing in each departmental school district for the county-specific boards of education." SECTION 3.  Article XVIII, section 12, of the Hawaii Constitution is amended to read as follows: "BOARD OF EDUCATION TRANSITION Section 12.  There shall be a period of transition from the [elected] appointed to the [appointed] elected [board] boards of education, as provided by law." SECTION 4.  The question to be printed on the ballot shall be as follows: "Shall the Board of Education be changed from a single board appointed by the governor to one statewide board and four countywide boards elected by the qualified voters of the State, serving no more than twelve years as a member, as provided by law?" SECTION 5.  Constitutional material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New constitutional material is underscored. SECTION 6.  This amendment shall take effect upon compliance with article XVII, section 3, of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: Constitutional Amendment; Elected School Boards; Minority Caucus Package Description: Proposes a constitutional amendment that would establish local school boards throughout the State to be elected by the voters and to serve no more than twelve years as a member.
