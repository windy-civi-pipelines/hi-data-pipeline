[(c)  A unit owner who receives a demand for payment from an association and disputes the amount of an assessment may request a written statement clearly indicating: (1)  The amount of common expenses included in the assessment, including the due date of each amount claimed; (2)  The amount of any penalty or fine, late fee, lien filing fee, and any other charge included in the assessment that is not imposed on all unit owners as a common expense; and (3)  The amount of attorneys' fees and costs, if any, included in the assessment. (d)  A unit owner who disputes the information in the written statement received from the association pursuant to subsection (c) may request a subsequent written statement that additionally informs the unit owner that: (1)  Under Hawaii law, a unit owner has no right to withhold common expense assessments for any reason; (2)  A unit owner has a right to demand mediation or arbitration to resolve disputes about the amount or validity of an association's common expense assessment; provided that the unit owner immediately pays the common expense assessment in full and keeps common expense assessments current; (3)  Payment in full of the common expense assessment shall not prevent the owner from contesting the common expense assessment or receiving a refund of amounts not owed; and (4)  If the unit owner contests any penalty or fine, late fee, lien filing fee, or other charges included in the assessment, except common expense assessments, the unit owner may demand mediation as provided in subsection (g) prior to paying those charges. (e)  No unit owner shall withhold any common expense assessment claimed by the association.  Nothing in this section shall limit the rights of an owner to the protection of all fair debt collection procedures mandated under federal and state law. (f)  A unit owner who pays an association the full amount of the common expenses claimed by the association may file in small claims court or require the association to mediate to resolve any disputes concerning the amount or validity of the association's common expense claim.  If the unit owner and the association are unable to resolve the dispute through mediation, either party may file for arbitration under section 514B‑162; provided that a unit owner may only file for arbitration if all amounts claimed by the association as common expenses are paid in full on or before the date of filing.  If the unit owner fails to keep all association common expense assessments current during the arbitration, the association may ask the arbitrator to temporarily suspend the arbitration proceedings.  If the unit owner pays all association common expense assessments within thirty days of the date of suspension, the unit owner may ask the arbitrator to recommence the arbitration proceedings.  If the unit owner fails to pay all association common expense assessments by the end of the thirty-day period, the association may ask the arbitrator to dismiss the arbitration proceedings.  The unit owner shall be entitled to a refund of any amounts paid as common expenses to the association that are not owed. (g)  A unit owner who contests the amount of any attorneys' fees and costs, penalties or fines, late fees, lien filing fees, or any other charges, except common expense assessments, may make a demand in writing for mediation on the validity of those charges.  The unit owner has thirty days from the date of the written statement requested pursuant to subsection (d) to file demand for mediation on the disputed charges, other than common expense assessments.  If the unit owner fails to file for mediation within thirty days of the date of the written statement requested pursuant to subsection (d), the association may proceed with collection of the charges. If the unit owner makes a request for mediation within thirty days, the association shall be prohibited from attempting to collect any of the disputed charges until the association has participated in the mediation.  The mediation shall be completed within sixty days of the unit owner's request for mediation; provided that if the mediation is not completed within sixty days or the parties are unable to resolve the dispute by mediation, the association may proceed with collection of all amounts due from the unit owner for attorneys' fees and costs, penalties or fines, late fees, lien filing fees, or any other charge that is not imposed on all unit owners as a common expense.] (c)  A unit owner shall have no right to withhold payment of a common expense assessment for any reason; provided that a unit owner may dispute the obligation to pay a common expense assessment after payment in full of the assessment.

In responding to the request, the association shall include a disclaimer that under state law, a unit owner has no right to withhold payment of a common expense assessment for any reason, but that the obligation to pay a common expense assessment may be disputed after the assessment has been paid in full.  The association shall also include in the disclaimer that a unit owner may dispute other assessments, apart from a common expense assessment, before making payment, and that the right to contest assessments is described in section 514B-D and this section. (e)  Nothing in this section shall limit the rights of a unit owner to the protection of all fair debt collection procedures mandated under federal and state law.

A unit owner who elects to request evaluative mediation shall do so before the initiation of an action concerning the assessment and within thirty days after the date of the statement described in subsection (d).  A timely demand for evaluative mediation shall stay an association's effort to collect the contested assessment for sixty days. (g)  An association may defend an assessment in court and in evaluative mediation.  The association may proceed to collect an unpaid assessment by any legal means except when collection efforts are stayed pursuant to subsection (f). (h)  In conjunction with or as an alternative to foreclosure proceedings under subsection (a), where a unit is owner-occupied, the association may authorize its managing agent or board to, after sixty days' written notice to the unit owner and to the unit's first mortgagee of the nonpayment of the unit's share of the common expenses, terminate the delinquent unit's access to the common elements and cease supplying a delinquent unit with any and all services normally supplied or paid for by the association.  Any terminated services and privileges shall be restored upon payment of all delinquent assessments but need not be restored until payment in full is received. (i)  Before the board or managing agent may take the actions permitted under subsection (h), the board shall adopt a written policy providing for [such] the actions and have the policy approved by a majority vote of the unit owners at an annual or special meeting of the association or by the written consent of a majority of the unit owners. (j)  Subject to this subsection, and subsections (k) and (l),  the board may specially assess the amount of the unpaid regular monthly common assessments for common expenses against a mortgagee or other purchaser who, in a judicial or nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure, purchases a delinquent unit; provided that the mortgagee or other purchaser may require the association to provide at no charge a notice of the association's intent to claim lien against the delinquent unit for the amount of the special assessment, [prior to] before the subsequent purchaser's acquisition of title to the delinquent unit.  The notice shall state the amount of the special assessment, how that amount was calculated, and the legal description of the unit.

Any proceedings to enforce an association's lien for any assessment shall be instituted within six years after the assessment became due; provided that if the owner of a unit subject to a lien of the association files a petition for relief under the United States Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. §101 et seq.), the period of time for instituting proceedings to enforce the association's lien shall be tolled until thirty days after the automatic stay of proceedings under section 362 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. §362) is lifted.

The mortgagee of record or other purchaser of the unit shall be deemed to acquire title and shall be required to pay the unit's share of common expenses and assessments beginning: (1)  Thirty-six days after the order confirming the sale to the purchaser has been filed with the court; (2)  Sixty days after the hearing at which the court grants the motion to confirm the sale to the purchaser; (3)  Thirty days after the public sale in a nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure conducted pursuant to chapter 667; or (4)  Upon the recording of the instrument of conveyance; whichever occurs first; provided that the mortgagee of record or other purchaser of the unit shall not be deemed to acquire title under paragraph (1), (2), or (3), if transfer of title is delayed past the thirty-six days specified in paragraph (1), the sixty days specified in paragraph (2), or the thirty days specified in paragraph (3), when a person who appears at the hearing on the motion or a party to the foreclosure action requests reconsideration of the motion or order to confirm sale, objects to the form of the proposed order to confirm sale, appeals the decision of the court to grant the motion to confirm sale, or the debtor or mortgagor declares bankruptcy or is involuntarily placed into bankruptcy.  In any [such] case, the mortgagee of record or other purchaser of the unit shall be deemed to acquire title upon recordation of the instrument of conveyance. [(c)  A unit owner who receives a demand for payment from an association and disputes the amount of an assessment may request a written statement clearly indicating: (1)  The amount of common expenses included in the assessment, including the due date of each amount claimed; (2)  The amount of any penalty or fine, late fee, lien filing fee, and any other charge included in the assessment that is not imposed on all unit owners as a common expense; and (3)  The amount of attorneys' fees and costs, if any, included in the assessment. (d)  A unit owner who disputes the information in the written statement received from the association pursuant to subsection (c) may request a subsequent written statement that additionally informs the unit owner that: (1)  Under Hawaii law, a unit owner has no right to withhold common expense assessments for any reason; (2)  A unit owner has a right to demand mediation or arbitration to resolve disputes about the amount or validity of an association's common expense assessment; provided that the unit owner immediately pays the common expense assessment in full and keeps common expense assessments current; (3)  Payment in full of the common expense assessment shall not prevent the owner from contesting the common expense assessment or receiving a refund of amounts not owed; and (4)  If the unit owner contests any penalty or fine, late fee, lien filing fee, or other charges included in the assessment, except common expense assessments, the unit owner may demand mediation as provided in subsection (g) prior to paying those charges. (e)  No unit owner shall withhold any common expense assessment claimed by the association.  Nothing in this section shall limit the rights of an owner to the protection of all fair debt collection procedures mandated under federal and state law. (f)  A unit owner who pays an association the full amount of the common expenses claimed by the association may file in small claims court or require the association to mediate to resolve any disputes concerning the amount or validity of the association's common expense claim.  If the unit owner and the association are unable to resolve the dispute through mediation, either party may file for arbitration under section 514B‑162; provided that a unit owner may only file for arbitration if all amounts claimed by the association as common expenses are paid in full on or before the date of filing.  If the unit owner fails to keep all association common expense assessments current during the arbitration, the association may ask the arbitrator to temporarily suspend the arbitration proceedings.  If the unit owner pays all association common expense assessments within thirty days of the date of suspension, the unit owner may ask the arbitrator to recommence the arbitration proceedings.  If the unit owner fails to pay all association common expense assessments by the end of the thirty-day period, the association may ask the arbitrator to dismiss the arbitration proceedings.  The unit owner shall be entitled to a refund of any amounts paid as common expenses to the association that are not owed. (g)  A unit owner who contests the amount of any attorneys' fees and costs, penalties or fines, late fees, lien filing fees, or any other charges, except common expense assessments, may make a demand in writing for mediation on the validity of those charges.  The unit owner has thirty days from the date of the written statement requested pursuant to subsection (d) to file demand for mediation on the disputed charges, other than common expense assessments.  If the unit owner fails to file for mediation within thirty days of the date of the written statement requested pursuant to subsection (d), the association may proceed with collection of the charges. If the unit owner makes a request for mediation within thirty days, the association shall be prohibited from attempting to collect any of the disputed charges until the association has participated in the mediation.  The mediation shall be completed within sixty days of the unit owner's request for mediation; provided that if the mediation is not completed within sixty days or the parties are unable to resolve the dispute by mediation, the association may proceed with collection of all amounts due from the unit owner for attorneys' fees and costs, penalties or fines, late fees, lien filing fees, or any other charge that is not imposed on all unit owners as a common expense.] (c)  A unit owner shall have no right to withhold payment of a common expense assessment for any reason; provided that a unit owner may dispute the obligation to pay a common expense assessment after payment in full of the assessment. (d)  A unit owner may dispute other assessments, apart from a common expense assessment, before making payment.  A unit owner who disputes an assessment may request a written statement clearly detailing: (1)  The common expenses included in an assessment and stating the due date of each amount of common expense assessed; (2)  The amount of any charge included in the assessment that is not imposed on all unit owners as a common expense, such as a fine or penalty, or a late fee or filing fee; and (3)  The amount of attorneys' fees and costs, if any, included in the assessment. In responding to the request, the association shall include a disclaimer that under state law, a unit owner has no right to withhold payment of a common expense assessment for any reason, but that the obligation to pay a common expense assessment may be disputed after the assessment has been paid in full.  The association shall also include in the disclaimer that a unit owner may dispute other assessments, apart from a common expense assessment, before making payment, and that the right to contest assessments is described in section 514B-D and this section. (e)  Nothing in this section shall limit the rights of a unit owner to the protection of all fair debt collection procedures mandated under federal and state law. (f)  A unit owner may file an action in any court with jurisdiction, or may request evaluative mediation, to contest: (1)  A paid assessment; or (2)  An unpaid assessment other than a common expense assessment or fine.  Fines shall be subject to section 514B-B. A unit owner who elects to request evaluative mediation shall do so before the initiation of an action concerning the assessment and within thirty days after the date of the statement described in subsection (d).  A timely demand for evaluative mediation shall stay an association's effort to collect the contested assessment for sixty days. (g)  An association may defend an assessment in court and in evaluative mediation.  The association may proceed to collect an unpaid assessment by any legal means except when collection efforts are stayed pursuant to subsection (f). (h)  In conjunction with or as an alternative to foreclosure proceedings under subsection (a), where a unit is owner-occupied, the association may authorize its managing agent or board to, after sixty days' written notice to the unit owner and to the unit's first mortgagee of the nonpayment of the unit's share of the common expenses, terminate the delinquent unit's access to the common elements and cease supplying a delinquent unit with any and all services normally supplied or paid for by the association.  Any terminated services and privileges shall be restored upon payment of all delinquent assessments but need not be restored until payment in full is received. (i)  Before the board or managing agent may take the actions permitted under subsection (h), the board shall adopt a written policy providing for [such] the actions and have the policy approved by a majority vote of the unit owners at an annual or special meeting of the association or by the written consent of a majority of the unit owners. (j)  Subject to this subsection, and subsections (k) and (l),  the board may specially assess the amount of the unpaid regular monthly common assessments for common expenses against a mortgagee or other purchaser who, in a judicial or nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure, purchases a delinquent unit; provided that the mortgagee or other purchaser may require the association to provide at no charge a notice of the association's intent to claim lien against the delinquent unit for the amount of the special assessment, [prior to] before the subsequent purchaser's acquisition of title to the delinquent unit.  The notice shall state the amount of the special assessment, how that amount was calculated, and the legal description of the unit. (k)  The amount of the special assessment assessed under subsection (j) shall not exceed the total amount of unpaid regular monthly common assessments that were assessed during the six months immediately preceding the completion of the judicial or nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure. (l)  For purposes of subsections (j) and (k), the following definitions shall apply, unless the context requires otherwise: "Completion" means: (1)  In a nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure, when the affidavit after public sale is recorded pursuant to section 667-33; and (2)  In a judicial foreclosure, when a purchaser is deemed to acquire title pursuant to subsection (b). "Regular monthly common assessments" does not include: (1)  Any other special assessment, except for a special assessment imposed on all units as part of a budget adopted pursuant to section 514B‑148, including commercial property assessed financing assessments imposed pursuant to section 196-64.5; (2)  Late charges, fines, or penalties; (3)  Interest assessed by the association; (4)  Any lien arising out of the assessment; or (5)  Any fees or costs related to the collection or enforcement of the assessment, including attorneys' fees and court costs. (m)  The cost of a release of any lien filed pursuant to this section shall be paid by the party requesting the release. (n)  After any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceeding in which the association acquires title to the unit, any excess rental income received by the association from the unit shall be paid to existing lien holders based on the priority of lien, and not on a pro rata basis, and shall be applied to the benefit of the unit owner.  For purposes of this subsection, excess rental income shall be any net income received by the association after a court has issued a final judgment determining the priority of a senior mortgagee and after paying, crediting, or reimbursing the association or a third party for: (1)  The lien for delinquent assessments pursuant to subsections (a) and (b); (2)  Any maintenance fee delinquency against the unit; (3)  Attorney's fees and other collection costs related to the association's foreclosure of the unit; or (4)  Any costs incurred by the association for the rental, repair, maintenance, or rehabilitation of the unit while the association is in possession of the unit including monthly association maintenance fees, management fees, real estate commissions, cleaning and repair expenses for the unit, and general excise taxes paid on rental income; provided that the lien for delinquent assessments under paragraph (1) shall be paid, credited, or reimbursed first." SECTION 12.  Section 514B-148, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (g) to read as follows: "(g)  Subject to the procedures of section [514B‑157] 514B‑A and any rules adopted by the commission, any unit owner whose association board fails to comply with this section may enforce compliance by the board.  In any proceeding to enforce compliance, a board that has not prepared an annual operating budget and reserve study shall have the burden of proving it has complied with this section."

(b)  If any claim by an owner is substantiated in any action against an association, any of its officers or directors, or its board to enforce any provision of the declaration, bylaws, house rules, or this chapter, then all reasonable and necessary expenses, costs, and attorneys' fees incurred by an owner shall be awarded to such owner; provided that no such award shall be made in any derivative action unless: (1)  The owner first shall have demanded and allowed reasonable time for the board to pursue such enforcement; or (2)  The owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the court that a demand for enforcement made to the board would have been fruitless. If any claim by an owner is not substantiated in any court action against an association, any of its officers or directors, or its board to enforce any provision of the declaration, bylaws, house rules, or this chapter, then all reasonable and necessary expenses, costs, and attorneys' fees incurred by an association shall be awarded to the association, unless before filing the action in court the owner has first submitted the claim to mediation, or to arbitration under subpart D, and made a good faith effort to resolve the dispute under any of those procedures."] PART V SECTION 15.  In codifying the new sections added by sections 2 and 3 of this Act, the revisor of statutes shall substitute appropriate section numbers for the letters used in designating the new sections in this Act.
