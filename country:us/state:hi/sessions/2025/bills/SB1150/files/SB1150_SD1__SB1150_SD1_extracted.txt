The court [may] shall not assess fees, costs, or expenses against this State unless authorized by law other than this chapter. (d)  In making a determination under this section, a court shall not consider as a factor weighing against the petitioner any taking of the child, or retention of the child after a visit or other temporary relinquishment of physical custody, from the person who has legal custody if there is evidence that the taking or retention of the child was for the purposes of obtaining gender-affirming health care services for the child and the law or policy of the other state limits the ability of a parent to obtain gender-affirming health care services for the child."

The court [may] shall not assess fees, costs, or expenses against this State unless authorized by law other than this chapter. (d)  In making a determination under this section, a court shall not consider as a factor weighing against the petitioner any taking of the child, or retention of the child after a visit or other temporary relinquishment of physical custody, from the person who has legal custody if there is evidence that the taking or retention of the child was for the purposes of obtaining gender-affirming health care services for the child and the law or policy of the other state limits the ability of a parent to obtain gender-affirming health care services for the child."

(b) If at a hearing the judge determines that the witness is material and necessary, that it will not cause undue hardship to the witness to be compelled to attend and testify in the prosecution or a grand jury investigation in the other state, and that the laws of the state in which the prosecution is pending, or grand jury investigation has commenced or is about to commence, and of any other state through which the witness may be required to pass by ordinary course of travel, will give to the witness protection from arrest and the service of civil and criminal process, the judge shall issue a summons, with a copy of the certificate attached, directing the witness to attend and testify in the court where the prosecution is pending, or where a grand jury investigation has commenced or is about to commence at a time and place specified in the summons[, except]; provided that no judge shall issue a summons in a case where prosecution is pending, or where a grand jury investigation has commenced or is about to commence, for a criminal violation of a law of another state involving [the provision,]: (1)  Seeking, receiving, paying for, [receipt of, or assistance with] or inquiring about reproductive health care services [as defined in section 323J-1] or gender-affirming health care services; (2)  Providing or responding to an inquiry about reproductive health care services or gender-affirming health care services; (3)  Assisting or aiding or abetting in any of the conduct described in paragraph (1) or (2); or (4)  Attempting or intending to engage in or providing material support for (or any other theory of vicarious, attempt, joint, several, or conspiracy liability derived therefrom) conduct described in paragraphs (1) to (3), unless the acts forming the basis of the prosecution or investigation would also constitute an offense in this State.  In any hearing, the certificate shall be prima facie evidence of all the facts stated therein. (c) If the certificate recommends that the witness be taken into immediate custody and delivered to an officer of the requesting state to assure the witness' attendance in the requesting state, the judge may, in lieu of notification of the hearing, direct that the witness be forthwith brought before the judge for the hearing; and the judge at the hearing being satisfied of the desirability of the custody and delivery, for which determination the certificate shall be prima facie proof of the desirability may, in lieu of issuing subpoena or summons, order that the witness be forthwith taken into custody and delivered to an officer of the requesting state. (d) If the witness, who is summoned pursuant to this section, after being paid or tendered by some properly authorized person a sum equivalent to the cost of round-trip air fare to the place where the prosecution is pending and $30 for each day, that the witness is required to travel and attend as a witness, fails without good cause to attend and testify as directed in the summons, the witness shall be punished in the manner provided for the punishment of any witness who disobeys a summons issued from a court of record in this State. (e)  As used in this section, "gender-affirming health care services" and "reproductive health care services" have the same meanings as defined in section 323J-1." SECTION 19.  If any provision of this Act, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the Act that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this Act are severable.
