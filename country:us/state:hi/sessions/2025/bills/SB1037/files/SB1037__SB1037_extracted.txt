(d)  Each controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the controller's refusal to take action on a request within a reasonable period of time after the consumer's receipt of the decision pursuant to subsection (c)(2); provided that the appeal process shall be similar to the process for submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to subsection (a).  Within sixty days of receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of its decision, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decision.  If the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer with an online method, if available, or other method, through which the consumer may contact the department to submit a complaint. §   -4  Authorized agent; designation; powers.  A consumer may designate another person to serve as the consumer's authorized agent, act on the consumer's behalf, or opt out of the processing of the consumer's personal data for one or more of the purposes specified in section -3(a)(5).  The consumer may designate an authorized agent by way of, among other things, a computer technology, including an internet link, browser setting, browser extension, or global device setting, indicating the consumer's intent to opt out of the processing.  A controller shall comply with an opt-out request received from an authorized agent if the controller is able to verify, with commercially reasonable effort, the identity of the consumer and the authorized agent's authority to act on the consumer's behalf. §   -5  Controller responsibilities; transparency.  (a) Each controller shall: (1)  Limit the collection of personal data to data that is adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary in relation to the purposes for which the data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer; (2)  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, not process personal data for purposes that are neither reasonably necessary to, nor compatible with, the disclosed purposes for which the personal data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer, unless the controller obtains the consumer's consent; (3)  Establish, implement, and maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical data security practices to protect any confidential information contained in, and the integrity and accessibility of, personal data.  The data security practices shall be appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data at issue; (4)  Provide an effective mechanism for a consumer to revoke the consumer's consent under this section that is at least as easy to use as the mechanism by which the consumer provided the consumer's consent and, upon revocation of the consumer's consent, cease to process the data as soon as practicable, but no later than fifteen days after the receipt of the request; (5)  Not process the personal data of a consumer for purposes of targeted advertising, or sell the consumer's personal data without the consumer's consent, under circumstances in which the controller has actual knowledge, and willfully disregards, that the consumer is at least thirteen years of age but younger than sixteen years of age; provided that no controller shall discriminate against a consumer for exercising any of the consumer rights contained in this chapter, including denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or services, or providing a different level of quality of goods or services to the consumer; (6)  Not process personal data in violation of state and federal laws that prohibit unlawful discrimination against consumers; and (7)  Not process sensitive data concerning a consumer without obtaining the consumer's consent, or, in the case of the processing of sensitive data concerning a known child, without processing the data in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (15 U.S.C. chapter 91); provided that nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require a controller to provide a product or service that requires the personal data of a consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain, or prohibit a controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee, if the offering is in connection with a consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts, or club card program. (b)  Any provision of a contract or agreement that purports to waive or limit in any way any consumer rights described in section -3 shall be deemed contrary to public policy and shall be void. (c)  Each controller shall provide to each applicable consumer a reasonably accessible, clear, and meaningful privacy notice that includes: (1)  The categories of personal data processed by the controller; (2)  The purpose for processing personal data; (3)  The methods by which the consumer may exercise the consumer's rights pursuant to section    -3, including the process for a consumer to appeal the controller's decision with regard to the consumer's request; (4)  The categories of personal data that the controller shares with third parties, if any; (5)  The categories of third parties, if any, with whom the controller shares personal data; and (6)  An active electronic mail address or other online mechanism that the consumer may use to contact the controller. (d)  If a controller sells personal data to a third party or processes personal data for targeted advertising, the controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose to the affected consumer the processing and manner in which the consumer may exercise the right to opt out of the processing. (e)  A controller shall establish, and shall describe in a privacy notice, one or more secure and reliable means for each consumer to submit a request to exercise the consumer's rights under this chapter.  These means shall take into account the ways in which consumers normally interact with the controller, the need for secure and reliable communication of the requests, and the ability of the controller to authenticate the identity of the consumer making the request.  No controller shall require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise the consumer's rights pursuant to section    -3, but may require a consumer to use an existing, active account. (f) No controller shall discriminate against a consumer for exercising any of the consumer rights contained in this chapter, including denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or services, or providing a different level of quality of goods and services to the consumer; provided that nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require a controller to: (1)  Provide a product or service that requires the personal data of a consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain; or (2)  Prohibit a controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee, if: (A)  The consumer has exercised the consumer's right to opt out pursuant to section -3; or (B)  The offer is related to a consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts, or club card program. §   -6  Responsibility according to role; controller and processor.  (a)  In meeting its obligations under this chapter, each processor shall adhere to the instructions of a controller and shall assist the controller.  The assistance shall include: (1)  Consideration of the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as is reasonably practicable, to fulfill the controller's obligation to respond to consumer rights requests pursuant to section    -3; (2)  Consideration of the nature of processing and the information available to the processor by assisting the controller in meeting the controller's obligations in relation to the security of processing the personal data and in relation to the notice of security breach provided pursuant to section 487N-2; and (3)  The provision of necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and document data protection assessments pursuant to section    -7. (b)  A contract between a controller and a processor shall govern the processor's data processing procedures with respect to processing performed on behalf of the controller.  The contract shall be binding and clearly set forth instructions for processing, the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of processing, and the rights and obligations of both parties.  The contract shall also include requirements that the processor shall: (1)  Ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to the data; (2)  At the controller's direction, delete or return all personal data to the controller upon request at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data is required by law; (3)  Upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all information in the processor's possession necessary to demonstrate the processor's compliance with the processor's obligations enumerated in this chapter; (4)  Allow, and cooperate with, any reasonable assessments of the processor's policies and technical and organizational measures in support of the processor's obligations enumerated in this chapter performed by the controller or the controller's designated assessor; alternatively, the processor may arrange for a qualified and independent assessor to conduct the assessment using an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and assessment procedure for the assessments.  The processor shall provide a report of the assessment to the controller upon request; and (5)  Engage any subcontractor pursuant to a written contract that requires the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data. (c)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve any controller or processor from the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor by virtue of the controller or processor's role in the processing relationship as determined pursuant to this chapter. (d)  A determination of whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that depends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed.  A person who is not limited in the processing of personal data pursuant to a controller's instructions, or who fails to adhere to these instructions, shall be deemed to be a controller and not a processor with respect to the specific processing of data.  A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data shall remain a processor. If a processor begins, alone or jointly with others, determining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, the processor shall be deemed to be a controller. §   -7  Data protection assessments.  (a) The data protection assessment requirements of this section shall apply to processing activities created or generated after January 1, 2026. (b)  Each controller shall conduct and document a data protection assessment of each of the following processing activities involving personal data: (1)  The processing of personal data for purposes of targeted advertising; (2)  The sale of personal data; (3)  The processing of personal data for purposes of profiling if the profiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of: (A)  Unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate impact on, consumers; (B)  Financial, physical, or reputational injury to consumers; (C)  A physical intrusion or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the private affairs or concerns, of consumers, that would be offensive to a reasonable person; or (D)  Other substantial injury to consumers; (4)  The processing of sensitive data; and (5)  Any processing activities involving personal data that present a heightened risk of harm to consumers. (c)  Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection (b) shall identify and evaluate the benefits, direct or indirect, that a controller, a consumer, other stakeholders, and the public may derive from processing against the potential risks to the rights of consumers associated with the processing, as mitigated by safeguards that may be employed by the controller to reduce these risks. The controller shall factor into this assessment the use of de-identified data, the reasonable expectations of consumers, the context of the processing, and the relationship between the controller and the consumer whose personal data is processed. (d)  The department may request, pursuant to a civil investigative demand, that a controller disclose any data protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the department, and the controller shall make the data protection assessment available to the department.  The department may evaluate the data protection assessment for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in section    -5. Data protection assessments shall be confidential and exempt from the public inspection and copying requirements of chapter 92F.  The disclosure of a data protection assessment pursuant to a request from the department shall not constitute a waiver of attorney‑client privilege or work product protection with respect to the assessment and any information contained in the assessment. (e)  A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing operations that include similar activities. (f)  Data protection assessments conducted by a controller for the purpose of compliance with other laws may comply under this section if the assessments have a reasonably comparable scope and effect. §   -8  Processing de-identified data; exemptions.  (a)  A controller in possession of de-identified data shall: (1)  Take reasonable measures to ensure that the data cannot be associated with a natural person; (2)  Publicly commit to maintaining and using de-identified data without attempting to re-identify the data; and (3)  Contractually obligate any recipients of the de‑identified data to comply with this chapter. (b)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require a controller or processor to: (1)  Re-identify de-identified data or pseudonymous data; or (2)  Maintain data in identifiable form, or collect, obtain, retain, or access any data or technological information, to be capable of associating an authenticated consumer request with personal data. (c)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require a controller or processor to comply with an authenticated consumer rights request received pursuant to section    -3 if: (1)  The controller is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal data or it would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the request with the personal data; (2)  The controller does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the specific consumer who is the subject of the personal data, or associate the personal data with other personal data about the same specific consumer; and (3)  The controller does not sell the personal data to any third party or otherwise voluntarily disclose the personal data to any third party other than a processor, except as otherwise permitted in this section. (d)  The consumer rights specified in sections -3(a)(1) through (4) and section    -5 shall not apply to pseudonymous data when the controller is able to demonstrate that any additional information necessary to identify the consumer is kept separately and is subject to effective technical and organizational controls that: (1)  Ensure that the personal data is not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person; and (2)  Prevent the controller from accessing the information. (e)  A controller that discloses pseudonymous data or de‑identified data shall exercise reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with any contractual commitments to which the pseudonymous data or de-identified data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to address any breaches of those contractual commitments. §   -9  Limitations.  (a) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict a controller or processor's ability to: (1)  Comply with federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations; (2)  Comply with a civil, criminal, or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena, or summons by federal, state, county, or other governmental authorities; (3)  Cooperate with law enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity that the controller or processor reasonably and in good faith believes may violate federal, state, or county laws, rules, or regulations; (4)  Investigate, establish, exercise, prepare for, or defend legal claims; (5)  Provide a product or service specifically requested by a consumer; perform a contract to which the consumer is a party, including fulfilling the terms of a written warranty; or take steps at the request of the consumer before entering into a contract; (6)  Take immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life or physical safety of the consumer or of another natural person if the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis; (7)  Prevent, detect, protect against, or respond to security incidents, identity theft, fraud, harassment, malicious or deceptive activities, or any illegal activity; preserve the integrity or security of systems; or investigate, report, or prosecute those responsible for any of these actions; (8)  Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws and is approved, monitored, and governed by an independent oversight entity that determines whether: (A)  The deletion of the information is likely to provide substantial benefits that do not exclusively accrue to the controller; (B)  The expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks; and (C)  The controller has implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate privacy risks associated with research, including any risks associated with reidentification; (9)  Assist another controller, processor, or third party with any of the obligations under this subsection; or (10)  Process personal data for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, community health, or population health, but only to the extent that processing is: (A)  Subject to suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights of the consumer whose personal data is being processed; and (B)  Under the responsibility of a professional subject to confidentiality obligations under federal, state, or local law.

(d)  Each controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the controller's refusal to take action on a request within a reasonable period of time after the consumer's receipt of the decision pursuant to subsection (c)(2); provided that the appeal process shall be similar to the process for submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to subsection (a).  Within sixty days of receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of its decision, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decision.  If the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer with an online method, if available, or other method, through which the consumer may contact the department to submit a complaint. §   -4  Authorized agent; designation; powers.  A consumer may designate another person to serve as the consumer's authorized agent, act on the consumer's behalf, or opt out of the processing of the consumer's personal data for one or more of the purposes specified in section -3(a)(5).  The consumer may designate an authorized agent by way of, among other things, a computer technology, including an internet link, browser setting, browser extension, or global device setting, indicating the consumer's intent to opt out of the processing.  A controller shall comply with an opt-out request received from an authorized agent if the controller is able to verify, with commercially reasonable effort, the identity of the consumer and the authorized agent's authority to act on the consumer's behalf. §   -5  Controller responsibilities; transparency.  (a) Each controller shall: (1)  Limit the collection of personal data to data that is adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary in relation to the purposes for which the data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer; (2)  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, not process personal data for purposes that are neither reasonably necessary to, nor compatible with, the disclosed purposes for which the personal data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer, unless the controller obtains the consumer's consent; (3)  Establish, implement, and maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical data security practices to protect any confidential information contained in, and the integrity and accessibility of, personal data.  The data security practices shall be appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data at issue; (4)  Provide an effective mechanism for a consumer to revoke the consumer's consent under this section that is at least as easy to use as the mechanism by which the consumer provided the consumer's consent and, upon revocation of the consumer's consent, cease to process the data as soon as practicable, but no later than fifteen days after the receipt of the request; (5)  Not process the personal data of a consumer for purposes of targeted advertising, or sell the consumer's personal data without the consumer's consent, under circumstances in which the controller has actual knowledge, and willfully disregards, that the consumer is at least thirteen years of age but younger than sixteen years of age; provided that no controller shall discriminate against a consumer for exercising any of the consumer rights contained in this chapter, including denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or services, or providing a different level of quality of goods or services to the consumer; (6)  Not process personal data in violation of state and federal laws that prohibit unlawful discrimination against consumers; and (7)  Not process sensitive data concerning a consumer without obtaining the consumer's consent, or, in the case of the processing of sensitive data concerning a known child, without processing the data in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (15 U.S.C. chapter 91); provided that nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require a controller to provide a product or service that requires the personal data of a consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain, or prohibit a controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee, if the offering is in connection with a consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts, or club card program. (b)  Any provision of a contract or agreement that purports to waive or limit in any way any consumer rights described in section -3 shall be deemed contrary to public policy and shall be void. (c)  Each controller shall provide to each applicable consumer a reasonably accessible, clear, and meaningful privacy notice that includes: (1)  The categories of personal data processed by the controller; (2)  The purpose for processing personal data; (3)  The methods by which the consumer may exercise the consumer's rights pursuant to section    -3, including the process for a consumer to appeal the controller's decision with regard to the consumer's request; (4)  The categories of personal data that the controller shares with third parties, if any; (5)  The categories of third parties, if any, with whom the controller shares personal data; and (6)  An active electronic mail address or other online mechanism that the consumer may use to contact the controller. (d)  If a controller sells personal data to a third party or processes personal data for targeted advertising, the controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose to the affected consumer the processing and manner in which the consumer may exercise the right to opt out of the processing. (e)  A controller shall establish, and shall describe in a privacy notice, one or more secure and reliable means for each consumer to submit a request to exercise the consumer's rights under this chapter.  These means shall take into account the ways in which consumers normally interact with the controller, the need for secure and reliable communication of the requests, and the ability of the controller to authenticate the identity of the consumer making the request.  No controller shall require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise the consumer's rights pursuant to section    -3, but may require a consumer to use an existing, active account. (f) No controller shall discriminate against a consumer for exercising any of the consumer rights contained in this chapter, including denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or services, or providing a different level of quality of goods and services to the consumer; provided that nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require a controller to: (1)  Provide a product or service that requires the personal data of a consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain; or (2)  Prohibit a controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee, if: (A)  The consumer has exercised the consumer's right to opt out pursuant to section -3; or (B)  The offer is related to a consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts, or club card program. §   -6  Responsibility according to role; controller and processor.  (a)  In meeting its obligations under this chapter, each processor shall adhere to the instructions of a controller and shall assist the controller.  The assistance shall include: (1)  Consideration of the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as is reasonably practicable, to fulfill the controller's obligation to respond to consumer rights requests pursuant to section    -3; (2)  Consideration of the nature of processing and the information available to the processor by assisting the controller in meeting the controller's obligations in relation to the security of processing the personal data and in relation to the notice of security breach provided pursuant to section 487N-2; and (3)  The provision of necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and document data protection assessments pursuant to section    -7. (b)  A contract between a controller and a processor shall govern the processor's data processing procedures with respect to processing performed on behalf of the controller.  The contract shall be binding and clearly set forth instructions for processing, the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of processing, and the rights and obligations of both parties.  The contract shall also include requirements that the processor shall: (1)  Ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to the data; (2)  At the controller's direction, delete or return all personal data to the controller upon request at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data is required by law; (3)  Upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all information in the processor's possession necessary to demonstrate the processor's compliance with the processor's obligations enumerated in this chapter; (4)  Allow, and cooperate with, any reasonable assessments of the processor's policies and technical and organizational measures in support of the processor's obligations enumerated in this chapter performed by the controller or the controller's designated assessor; alternatively, the processor may arrange for a qualified and independent assessor to conduct the assessment using an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and assessment procedure for the assessments.  The processor shall provide a report of the assessment to the controller upon request; and (5)  Engage any subcontractor pursuant to a written contract that requires the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data. (c)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve any controller or processor from the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor by virtue of the controller or processor's role in the processing relationship as determined pursuant to this chapter. (d)  A determination of whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that depends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed.  A person who is not limited in the processing of personal data pursuant to a controller's instructions, or who fails to adhere to these instructions, shall be deemed to be a controller and not a processor with respect to the specific processing of data.  A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data shall remain a processor. If a processor begins, alone or jointly with others, determining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, the processor shall be deemed to be a controller. §   -7  Data protection assessments.  (a) The data protection assessment requirements of this section shall apply to processing activities created or generated after January 1, 2026. (b)  Each controller shall conduct and document a data protection assessment of each of the following processing activities involving personal data: (1)  The processing of personal data for purposes of targeted advertising; (2)  The sale of personal data; (3)  The processing of personal data for purposes of profiling if the profiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of: (A)  Unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate impact on, consumers; (B)  Financial, physical, or reputational injury to consumers; (C)  A physical intrusion or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the private affairs or concerns, of consumers, that would be offensive to a reasonable person; or (D)  Other substantial injury to consumers; (4)  The processing of sensitive data; and (5)  Any processing activities involving personal data that present a heightened risk of harm to consumers. (c)  Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection (b) shall identify and evaluate the benefits, direct or indirect, that a controller, a consumer, other stakeholders, and the public may derive from processing against the potential risks to the rights of consumers associated with the processing, as mitigated by safeguards that may be employed by the controller to reduce these risks. The controller shall factor into this assessment the use of de-identified data, the reasonable expectations of consumers, the context of the processing, and the relationship between the controller and the consumer whose personal data is processed. (d)  The department may request, pursuant to a civil investigative demand, that a controller disclose any data protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the department, and the controller shall make the data protection assessment available to the department.  The department may evaluate the data protection assessment for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in section    -5. Data protection assessments shall be confidential and exempt from the public inspection and copying requirements of chapter 92F.  The disclosure of a data protection assessment pursuant to a request from the department shall not constitute a waiver of attorney‑client privilege or work product protection with respect to the assessment and any information contained in the assessment. (e)  A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing operations that include similar activities. (f)  Data protection assessments conducted by a controller for the purpose of compliance with other laws may comply under this section if the assessments have a reasonably comparable scope and effect. §   -8  Processing de-identified data; exemptions.  (a)  A controller in possession of de-identified data shall: (1)  Take reasonable measures to ensure that the data cannot be associated with a natural person; (2)  Publicly commit to maintaining and using de-identified data without attempting to re-identify the data; and (3)  Contractually obligate any recipients of the de‑identified data to comply with this chapter. (b)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require a controller or processor to: (1)  Re-identify de-identified data or pseudonymous data; or (2)  Maintain data in identifiable form, or collect, obtain, retain, or access any data or technological information, to be capable of associating an authenticated consumer request with personal data. (c)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require a controller or processor to comply with an authenticated consumer rights request received pursuant to section    -3 if: (1)  The controller is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal data or it would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the request with the personal data; (2)  The controller does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the specific consumer who is the subject of the personal data, or associate the personal data with other personal data about the same specific consumer; and (3)  The controller does not sell the personal data to any third party or otherwise voluntarily disclose the personal data to any third party other than a processor, except as otherwise permitted in this section. (d)  The consumer rights specified in sections -3(a)(1) through (4) and section    -5 shall not apply to pseudonymous data when the controller is able to demonstrate that any additional information necessary to identify the consumer is kept separately and is subject to effective technical and organizational controls that: (1)  Ensure that the personal data is not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person; and (2)  Prevent the controller from accessing the information. (e)  A controller that discloses pseudonymous data or de‑identified data shall exercise reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with any contractual commitments to which the pseudonymous data or de-identified data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to address any breaches of those contractual commitments. §   -9  Limitations.  (a) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict a controller or processor's ability to: (1)  Comply with federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations; (2)  Comply with a civil, criminal, or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena, or summons by federal, state, county, or other governmental authorities; (3)  Cooperate with law enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity that the controller or processor reasonably and in good faith believes may violate federal, state, or county laws, rules, or regulations; (4)  Investigate, establish, exercise, prepare for, or defend legal claims; (5)  Provide a product or service specifically requested by a consumer; perform a contract to which the consumer is a party, including fulfilling the terms of a written warranty; or take steps at the request of the consumer before entering into a contract; (6)  Take immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life or physical safety of the consumer or of another natural person if the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis; (7)  Prevent, detect, protect against, or respond to security incidents, identity theft, fraud, harassment, malicious or deceptive activities, or any illegal activity; preserve the integrity or security of systems; or investigate, report, or prosecute those responsible for any of these actions; (8)  Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws and is approved, monitored, and governed by an independent oversight entity that determines whether: (A)  The deletion of the information is likely to provide substantial benefits that do not exclusively accrue to the controller; (B)  The expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks; and (C)  The controller has implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate privacy risks associated with research, including any risks associated with reidentification; (9)  Assist another controller, processor, or third party with any of the obligations under this subsection; or (10)  Process personal data for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, community health, or population health, but only to the extent that processing is: (A)  Subject to suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights of the consumer whose personal data is being processed; and (B)  Under the responsibility of a professional subject to confidentiality obligations under federal, state, or local law. (b)  The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this chapter shall not restrict a controller or processor's ability to collect, use, or retain data to: (1)  Conduct internal research to develop, improve, or repair products, services, or technology; (2)  Effectuate a product recall; (3)  Identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality; or (4)  Perform internal operations that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer, reasonably anticipated based on the consumer's existing relationship with the controller, or are otherwise compatible with processing data in furtherance of the provision of a product or service specifically requested by a consumer or the performance of a contract to which the consumer is a party. (c)  The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this chapter shall not apply if the controller or processor's compliance with this chapter would violate an evidentiary privilege under state law.  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent a controller or processor from providing personal data concerning a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under state law as part of a privileged communication. (d)  A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a third-party controller or processor in compliance with the requirements of this chapter shall not be deemed to be in violation of this chapter if the third-party controller or processor that receives and processes the personal data is in violation of this chapter; provided that, at the time of the disclosure of the personal data, the disclosing controller or processor did not have actual knowledge that the recipient intended to commit a violation.  A third-party controller or processor that receives personal data from a controller or processor in compliance with the requirements of this chapter shall not be deemed to be in violation of this chapter if the controller or processor from which the third-party controller or processor receives the personal data is in violation of this chapter. (e)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to: (1)  Impose an obligation on controllers and processors that adversely affects the rights or freedoms of any person, including the right of free expression pursuant to the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; or (2)  Apply to the processing of personal data by a person in the course of a purely personal or household activity. (f)  Personal data processed by a controller pursuant to this section shall not be processed for any purpose other than those expressly listed in this section unless otherwise allowed by this chapter.  Personal data processed by a controller pursuant to this section may be processed to the extent that the processing is: (1)  Reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this section; and (2)  Adequate, relevant, and limited to the processing necessary in relation to the specific purposes listed in this section; provided that for any personal data collected, used, or retained pursuant to subsection (b), the processor shall consider the nature and purpose or purposes of the collection, use, or retention; provided further that the personal data shall be subject to reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of the personal data and to reduce reasonably foreseeable risks of harm to consumers relating to the collection, use, or retention of personal data. (g)  If a controller processes personal data pursuant to an exemption provided in this section, the controller shall bear the burden of demonstrating that the processing qualifies for the exemption and complies with subsection (f). (h)  An entity's processing of personal data for the purposes expressly identified in subsection (a) shall not be the sole basis for the department to consider the entity as a controller with respect to the processing. §   -10  Investigative authority.  The department may investigate alleged violations of this chapter pursuant to section 28-2.5 and any other applicable law. §   -11  Enforcement; civil penalty; expenses.  (a) The department shall have exclusive authority to enforce this chapter. (b)  Before initiating any action under this chapter, the department shall provide a controller or processor a thirty-day written notice that identifies the specific provisions of this chapter that the controller or processor has allegedly violated. If, within the thirty-day period, the controller or processor cures the alleged violation and provides the department with an express written statement that the alleged violation has been cured and that no further violations shall occur, no action shall be initiated against the controller or processor. (c)  If a controller or processor continues to violate this chapter following the cure period provided for in subsection (b) or breaches the express written statement provided to the department pursuant to subsection (b), the department may: (1)  Initiate an action in the name of the State; (2)  Seek an injunction to restrain any violations of this chapter; and (3)  Seek to impose civil penalties of up to $7,500 for each violation under this chapter. (d)  For any action initiated under this chapter, the department may recover reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, that the department incurred in the investigation and preparation of the case. (e)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to provide the basis for, or be subject to, a private right of action for violations of this chapter or under any other law. §   -12  Consumer privacy special fund.  (a) There is established in the state treasury the consumer privacy special fund into which shall be deposited: (1)  All civil penalties, expenses, and attorney fees collected pursuant to this chapter; (2)  Interest earned on moneys in the fund; and (3)  Appropriations made by the legislature.
