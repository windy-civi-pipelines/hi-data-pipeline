Section 1:
SB1214 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1214 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to vacant homes. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii residents substantially subsidize the State's infrastructure through various forms of taxation, which directly enhances property values and development opportunities throughout Hawaii.  The legislature further finds that an increasing number of residential properties are being purchased as second homes and left largely unoccupied throughout the year, creating adverse impacts on local communities and failing to contribute proportionally to the local economy that sustains their value. The legislature additionally finds that vacant second homes benefit from publicly funded infrastructure, services, and improvements while not generating the economic activity typically associated with occupied residences.  This creates an inequitable burden on Hawaii residents who continuously support local businesses and contribute to the vitality of their communities through daily economic activity. The purpose of this Act is to recover lost funds from vacant homes by establishing an equitable tax structure for vacant second homes by: (1)  Implementing a surcharge equivalent to the general excise tax on the: (A)  Average market rental rates to incentivize property owners to either occupy their properties or make them available for long-term rental, thereby contributing to Hawaii's housing inventory and local economy; and (B)  Potential purchases a typical household would have made had the property been occupied as a primary residence; and (2)  Using the revenues of the surcharge for a rental assistance program similar to the federal section 8 tenant-based housing assistance program. SECTION 2.  Chapter 201H, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part I to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§201H-     Vacant homes special fund.  (a)  There is established a vacant homes special fund into which shall be deposited the following moneys: (1)  Appropriations by the legislature; (2)  Gifts, donations, and grants from public agencies and private persons; and (3)  All proceeds collected by the department of taxation pursuant to chapter 237, part    . All interest earned or accrued on moneys deposited in the fund shall become part of the fund.  The fund shall be administered by the department; provided that the department may contract with a public or private agency to provide the day‑to‑day management of the fund. (b)  Subject to legislative authorization, moneys from the fund may be appropriated to the counties for: (1)  Enforcement of chapter 237, part    ; and (2)  Rental assistance programs similar to the federal section 8 tenant-based housing assistance payment program of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended." SECTION 3.  Chapter 237, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "PART    .  Vacancy surcharge §237-A  Definitions.  For the purposes of this part: "Individual" means a natural person. "Residential real property" means fee simple or leasehold real property on which is situated: (1)  At least one dwelling unit; or (2)  A residential condominium or cooperative apartment, the primary use of which is occupancy as a residence; that is not subject to taxation pursuant to chapter 237D. §237-B  Imposition of surcharge.  (a)  There is hereby levied and shall be assessed and collected annually, a surcharge against persons licensed pursuant to section 237-9 on account of the person's vacant residential real property in the State.

(d) The assessment shall be presumed to be correct until and unless, upon an appeal duly taken as provided in section 237-42, the contrary shall be clearly proved by the owner assessed, and the burden of proof upon that appeal shall be upon the owner assessed to disprove the correctness of the assessment. (e) After a return is filed under this part, the director of taxation shall cause the return to be examined and may make further audits or investigation as the director of taxation considers necessary.
