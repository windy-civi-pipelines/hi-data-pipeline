C.D. 1
A BILL FORAN ACT
RELATING TO THE STABILIZATION OF PROPERTY INSURANCE.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 PART I
2 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that before the wildfire
3 event in Lahaina, Maui, on August 8, 2023, the availability of
4 condominium building master property insurance policy options
5 within the condominium insurance marketplace was already
6 shrinking. Due in part to the shrinking condominium insurance
7 marketplace, condominium building master property insurance
8 policy premiums have increased exponentially, with insurers
9 increasing deductible amounts from what used to be between
10 $10,000 to $25,000 per unit, per occurrence, to as much as
11 $250,000. These increased deductibles are also due to
12 consistent and high-cost losses.
13 The legislature also finds that while the State has avoided
14 a direct, major impact from a major hurricane since Hurricane
IS Iniki devastated Kauai and damaged homes along Oahu's leeward
16 coast more than thirty years ago, mortgage lenders continue to
17 require Hawaii homeowners to carry hurricane insurance that can

C.D. 1
1 cost two to three times the annual premiums of a conventional
2 homeowner policy.
3 The legislature further finds that Hawaii Business Magazine
4 recently reported that generally, a condominium building or
5 complex carries a master hurricane policy that covers one
6 hundred per cent of the cost to replace the property--millions
7 of dollars in many cases. Unfortunately, because insurance
8 premiums for those policies have recently risen so high, the
9 president of Insurance Associates estimates that three hundred
10 seventy-five to three hundred ninety buildings, including new
11 high-rise towers in Kakaako, Oahu, have opted to renew their
12 hurricane insurance policies with less than one hundred per cent
13 hurricane coverage. This practice of reducing coverage is
14 creating complications and adverse consequences for every person
15 and entity associated with condominiums in Hawaii, from lenders
16 and insurance agents to buyers and sellers of condominiums.
17 Furthermore, some condominium associations for older
18 buildings are forced to obtain property insurance through the
19 secondary insurance market if they are dropped by the standard
20 insurers for, among other things, having too many claims. The
21 president of Insurance Associates reported that more than seven
2025-2834 SB1044 GDI SMA-4.docx
Page 3
S.B. NO. --
C.D. 1
1 hundred condominium buildings on Oahu alone were built before
2 1990. These secondary market insurers are not bound by the
3 State's laws or administrative rules governing rates, so their
4 prices may be more expensive than those of standard insurance
5 carriers.
6 To illustrate the difference in insurance premium costs,
7 the president of Insurance Associates cites the example of one
8 high-rise condominium in Waikiki in which the condominium
9 association had been paying an annual insurance premium of
10 $235,000 for property and hurricane insurance and had already
11 been dropped by two of the standard insurance companies when the
12 third company declined to renew their insurance policy. The
13 stated reason for the nonrenewal and rejection was that the
14 building's aging plumbing had not been replaced. As a result,
15 the condominium association was forced to purchase insurance on
16 the secondary market, which cost approximately $1,200,000.
17 The legislature finds that the consequences of
18 under-insured condominium buildings, including condominium
19 buildings that lack full hurricane coverage, also impact
20 individual owners. Today, there are only three insurers writing
21 hurricane coverage for condominium buildings, one of which is
2025-2834 SB1044 CDl SMA-4.docx
■HmiiffliMiiiiMHiiiliiin
Page 4 S.B. NO. sT.
C.D. 1
1 only willing to underwrite $10,000,000 to $25,000,000 in
2 hurricane coverage while underwriting all other coverage up to
3 the building's value. If a condominium building's insurance
4 coverage, including hurricane coverage, is below its full value,
5 the mortgages on individual units within that building would not
6 meet the underwriting criteria to qualify for purchase through
7 the federal government's secondary mortgage market, meaning that
8 these mortgages cannot be sold by financial institutions to
9 mortgage investor entities, such as the Federal National
10 Mortgage Association (commonly referred to as Fannie Mae) and
11 the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (commonly referred to
12 as Freddie Mac). Coverage to address this lack of hurricane
13 insurance coverage options is available from the excess and
14 surplus lines market, which comprises insurers that are not
15 licensed in the State; however, some condominium buildings are
16 unwilling to purchase this coverage because of its high price.
17 The legislature understands that although this Act authorizes
18 the Hawaii hurricane relief fund to expand coverage to
19 condominium buildings, premium rates may be high due to the rise
20 in the global reinsurance market for hurricane insurance caused
21 by the frequency and severity of worldwide disasters.

C.D. 1
1 In addition, Hawaii Business Magazine has reported that the
2 2021 collapse of the Surfside condominium building in Miami,
3 Florida, is also having a ripple effect on condominium lending.
4 In 2023, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac made permanent the rules for
5 condominium lending that were created in the wake of that
6 disaster and ceased buying loans for buildings or projects that
7 have put off major repairs--such as replacing old water pipes.
8 These new lending rules also prohibit the sale of a loan on a
9 condominium building to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac if that
10 building has unfunded repairs totaling more than $10,000 per
11 unit.
12 This inability to sell condominium mortgages would require
13 financial institutions that originated mortgages to retain those
14 mortgages, thereby lessening their overall financial capacity to
15 originate more mortgages. Further, the risk of loss if a
16 hurricane occurs may impair a financial institution's financial
17 safety and soundness, which would in turn hamper consumers'
18 abilities to obtain financing to purchase dwellings of their
19 own. This measure establishes the condominium loan program, to
20 be administered by the Hawaii green infrastructure authority, to
21 provide financing for condominium associations to address

1 deferred maintenance or repair issues and to further help
2 stabilize the standard property insurance market in the State by
3 mitigating future claims.
4 The legislature notes that the wildfire in Lahaina, Maui,
5 on August 8, 2023, has also impacted the way reinsurers and
6 standard insurers view Hawaii's wildfire risk. The president of
7 Insurance Associates estimates that while Hawaii has always been
8 rated for hurricanes for property insurance purposes, it has
9 never been rated for wildfires. Now that the State has
10 experienced wildfires, not only in Lahaina, but also in Kula,
11 West Oahu, and Mililani, parts of all islands will be rated for
12 wildfires. Moreover, it is surmised that some insurers will not
13 maintain their current policy-count in the State because of
14 their increased costs for reinsurance, geographical
15 concentration of risk, and inadequate rates both pre- and
16 post-wildfire. Insurers have the financial responsibility to
17 pay losses, and if reinsurance and premiums are not sufficient
18 to cover these losses, an insurer needs to reduce their exposure
19 by restricting new policies, reducing their policy-count, or
20 both. The legislature recognizes that the price impact on
2025-2834 SB1044 CDl SMA-4.docx 6
Page 7
S.B. NO. Si
C.D. 1
1 reinsurance from recent wildfires is not fully known and price
2 increases may continue into the foreseeable future.
3 The legislature also understands that the market for
4 reinsurance, the insurance that property and casualty insurance
5 companies pay to share their risk, is global. Therefore, storms
6 and other catastrophic losses occurring anywhere in the world
7 may potentially impact the amounts that homeowners and
8 condominium associations in Hawaii pay for their insurance
9 coverage.
10 The legislature also acknowledges that although insurance
11 coverage, excluding hurricane coverage, for condominium
12 buildings is available in the standard insurance market, the
13 availability of this coverage is not guaranteed. If this
14 coverage became unavailable to condominium buildings, then under
15 this Act, the Hawaii property insurance association would be
16 authorized to provide this coverage.
17 This Act expands the authority of these State-established
18 insurance entities to assist in the stabilization of the
19 property insurance market until risks can be depopulated back to
20 the standard insurance market when market conditions improve and
21 risks become more insurable because of building component

C.D. 1
1 replacement or maintenance, or mitigation equipment or protocols
2 have been implemented for fire, wildfire, or hurricane events.
3 The legislature also recognizes that, although there has
4 been much focus on the instability of the condominium insurance
5 market in Hawaii, the broader property insurance industry faces
6 uncertainty amidst changing economic and regulatory conditions,
7 rising costs, increased reinsurance costs, and more frequent
8 severe weather events. Given these precarious conditions, it is
9 possible that a future disaster or other unforeseen circumstance
10 could cause the availability of insurance to shrink for classes
11 of real property other than condominiums, including
12 single-family homes and townhouses.
13 Accordingly, this Act authorizes the Hawaii property
14 insurance association to provide additional insurance coverage
15 within the State for certain categories of properties if the
16 Hawaii property insurance association and insurance commissioner
17 determine that those categories of properties are experiencing a
18 casualty and property insurance market failure. This authority
19 will provide the Hawaii property insurance association with the
20 flexibility to quickly address potential future disruptions in
21 the insurance market. This flexibility is critical to ensure
2025-2834 SB1044 GDI SMA-4.docx
Page 9 S.B. NO. ^2
C.D. 1
1 that Hawaii residents living in non-condominium properties such
2 as single-family homes and townhouses are protected following
3 unexpected disasters that could otherwise increase the cost of
4 insurance to the point where residents cannot afford to continue
5 living in their homes or in the State.
6 The legislature believes that it is critical to begin the
7 process to adequately capitalize the Hawaii property insurance
8 association and Hawaii hurricane relief fund because insuring
9 these risks could bring an enormous amount of risk exposure to
10 the funds. Therefore, funding mechanisms must be broad on an
11 initial and ongoing basis and spread among as many parties
12 involved in real property transactions within the State as
13 possible to ensure that the financial impacts are apportioned as
14 equitably as practicable, and that reserve funds are adequately
15 capitalized if losses exceed the funds' capacities.
16 In the past, the Hawaii hurricane relief fund was funded in
17 part through the special mortgage recording fee, which was
18 imposed on each mortgage recorded with the bureau of
19 conveyances. The legislature recognizes concerns that the
20 special mortgage recording fee is regressive because homebuyers
21 who need to finance more of their purchase price are assessed
2025-2834 SB1044 CDl SMA-4.docx
Page 10
S.B. NO. s"
H.D. 2
C.D. 1
1 proportionally more than buyers who need to finance less or who
2 can afford to complete their purchase using cash.
3 Therefore, this Act repeals the special mortgage recording
4 fee and instead authorizes the Hawaii hurricane relief fund
5 board of directors, subject to the approval of the insurance
6 commissioner, to establish a temporary recording fee, which will
7 be imposed as a flat assessment on each document that is
8 recorded with the bureau of conveyances or filed with the
9 assistant registrar of the land court of the State, as
10 appropriate. This fee, if activated by the Hawaii hurricane
11 relief fund and approved by the insurance commissioner, is
12 intended to be a temporary funding mechanism that will spread
13 costs out in a way that will reduce the regressive financial
14 impact imposed on individuals and families who can only afford
15 to purchase a residential dwelling by financing the purchase.
16 If the Hawaii hurricane relief fund board of directors
17 determines that the fee revenue is no longer required, this Act
18 allows the board to terminate collection of the fee without
19 seeking legislative action.
20 This Act provides additional funding mechanisms through
21 the:

1 (1) Appropriation of general funds; and
2 (2) Option for the Hawaii hurricane relief fund to
3 reactivate the assessment of insurers at an assessment
4 rate determined by the Hawaii hurricane relief fund's
5 board of directors to augment the capitalization of
6 the Hawaii hurricane relief fund.
7 The legislature finds that this Act is necessary to:
8 (1) Stabilize the property insurance market so that
9 insurers continue to insure properties in the State;
10 (2) Ensure access to adequate property insurance for
11 certain properties located within the State to allow
12 lenders to finance mortgages that meet the
13 requirements of the secondary mortgage market; and
14 (3) Serve an important public purpose.
15 This Act is a stop-gap measure to provide insurance
16 availability for condominium associations that are unable to
17 purchase adequate property insurance for their respective
18 condominium buildings that are in insurable condition.
19 Condominium associations that apply for coverage through the
20 Hawaii property insurance association will need to pay premiums
21 that are sufficient to cover the condominium association's

1 exposure to losses. This measure is not designed to be a
2 long-term solution, and therefore the legislature has imposed a
3 one-time five-year coverage period and commissioned a study to
4 recommend long-term solutions to stabilize the property
5 insurance market in the State. To that end, in addition to
6 providing for the issuance of short-term property insurance
7 coverage, this Act also effectively requires the insurance
8 commissioner to conduct a study to develop a long-term solution.
9 The legislature notes that a long-term solution may potentially
10 include the issuance of property insurance policies for
11 condominium buildings that are in need of repair or replacement
12 of components.
13 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
14 (1) Amend state laws governing the Hawaii property
15 insurance association and the Hawaii hurricane relief
16 fund to enable these entities to underwrite certain
17 insurance risks in the State that no standard insurer
18 is currently willing to underwrite;
19 (2) Establish a condominium loan program and condominium
20 loan revolving fund to provide qualified condominium
2025-2834 SB1044 CDl SMA-4.docx 12

1 associations with low-cost financing or refinancing
2 for maintenance or repair projects;
3 (3) Establish a condominium loan loss reserves program to
4 incentivize community development financial
5 institutions to provide loans at competitive rates and
6 terms to condominium associations to allow the
7 associations to perform necessary maintenance or make
8 repairs;
9 (4) Require the insurance commissioner to conduct a study
10 to monitor and identify the most effective methods of
11 stabilizing the property insurance market in the
12 State; and
13 (5) Appropriate funds.

19 (1) Has a condominium association that is registered with
20 the real estate commission in accordance with chapter

5 "High-rise condominium" means a condominium that has four
6 or more stories that contain units that are or can be occupied
7 by a person.
8 "Property insurance" means policies, riders, or
9 endorsements of insurance that provide indemnity, in whole or in
10 part, for the loss, destruction, or damage of property and
11 against legal liability for the death, injury, or disability of
12 any human being, or from damage to property. "Property
13 insurance" does not include any indemnity for loss, destruction,
14 damage of property, or death, injury, or disability of any human
15 being, or from damage to property, caused by a hurricane."

THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE. 2025
STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 2
C.D. 1
A BILL FORAN ACT
RELATING TO THE STABILIZATION OF PROPERTY INSURANCE.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 PART I
2 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that before the wildfire
3 event in Lahaina, Maui, on August 8, 2023, the availability of
4 condominium building master property insurance policy options
5 within the condominium insurance marketplace was already
6 shrinking. Due in part to the shrinking condominium insurance
7 marketplace, condominium building master property insurance
8 policy premiums have increased exponentially, with insurers
9 increasing deductible amounts from what used to be between
10 $10,000 to $25,000 per unit, per occurrence, to as much as
11 $250,000. These increased deductibles are also due to
12 consistent and high-cost losses.
13 The legislature also finds that while the State has avoided
14 a direct, major impact from a major hurricane since Hurricane
IS Iniki devastated Kauai and damaged homes along Oahu's leeward
16 coast more than thirty years ago, mortgage lenders continue to
17 require Hawaii homeowners to carry hurricane insurance that can

1 cost two to three times the annual premiums of a conventional
2 homeowner policy.
3 The legislature further finds that Hawaii Business Magazine
4 recently reported that generally, a condominium building or
5 complex carries a master hurricane policy that covers one
6 hundred per cent of the cost to replace the property--millions
7 of dollars in many cases. Unfortunately, because insurance
8 premiums for those policies have recently risen so high, the
9 president of Insurance Associates estimates that three hundred
10 seventy-five to three hundred ninety buildings, including new
11 high-rise towers in Kakaako, Oahu, have opted to renew their
12 hurricane insurance policies with less than one hundred per cent
13 hurricane coverage. This practice of reducing coverage is
14 creating complications and adverse consequences for every person
15 and entity associated with condominiums in Hawaii, from lenders
16 and insurance agents to buyers and sellers of condominiums.
17 Furthermore, some condominium associations for older
18 buildings are forced to obtain property insurance through the
19 secondary insurance market if they are dropped by the standard
20 insurers for, among other things, having too many claims. The
21 president of Insurance Associates reported that more than seven

1 hundred condominium buildings on Oahu alone were built before
2 1990. These secondary market insurers are not bound by the
3 State's laws or administrative rules governing rates, so their
4 prices may be more expensive than those of standard insurance
5 carriers.
6 To illustrate the difference in insurance premium costs,
7 the president of Insurance Associates cites the example of one
8 high-rise condominium in Waikiki in which the condominium
9 association had been paying an annual insurance premium of
10 $235,000 for property and hurricane insurance and had already
11 been dropped by two of the standard insurance companies when the
12 third company declined to renew their insurance policy. The
13 stated reason for the nonrenewal and rejection was that the
14 building's aging plumbing had not been replaced. As a result,
15 the condominium association was forced to purchase insurance on
16 the secondary market, which cost approximately $1,200,000.
17 The legislature finds that the consequences of
18 under-insured condominium buildings, including condominium
19 buildings that lack full hurricane coverage, also impact
20 individual owners. Today, there are only three insurers writing
21 hurricane coverage for condominium buildings, one of which is

C.D. 1
1 only willing to underwrite $10,000,000 to $25,000,000 in
2 hurricane coverage while underwriting all other coverage up to
3 the building's value. If a condominium building's insurance
4 coverage, including hurricane coverage, is below its full value,
5 the mortgages on individual units within that building would not
6 meet the underwriting criteria to qualify for purchase through
7 the federal government's secondary mortgage market, meaning that
8 these mortgages cannot be sold by financial institutions to
9 mortgage investor entities, such as the Federal National
10 Mortgage Association (commonly referred to as Fannie Mae) and
11 the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (commonly referred to
12 as Freddie Mac). Coverage to address this lack of hurricane
13 insurance coverage options is available from the excess and
14 surplus lines market, which comprises insurers that are not
15 licensed in the State; however, some condominium buildings are
16 unwilling to purchase this coverage because of its high price.
17 The legislature understands that although this Act authorizes
18 the Hawaii hurricane relief fund to expand coverage to
19 condominium buildings, premium rates may be high due to the rise
20 in the global reinsurance market for hurricane insurance caused
21 by the frequency and severity of worldwide disasters.

1 In addition, Hawaii Business Magazine has reported that the
2 2021 collapse of the Surfside condominium building in Miami,
3 Florida, is also having a ripple effect on condominium lending.
4 In 2023, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac made permanent the rules for
5 condominium lending that were created in the wake of that
6 disaster and ceased buying loans for buildings or projects that
7 have put off major repairs--such as replacing old water pipes.
8 These new lending rules also prohibit the sale of a loan on a
9 condominium building to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac if that
10 building has unfunded repairs totaling more than $10,000 per
11 unit.
12 This inability to sell condominium mortgages would require
13 financial institutions that originated mortgages to retain those
14 mortgages, thereby lessening their overall financial capacity to
15 originate more mortgages. Further, the risk of loss if a
16 hurricane occurs may impair a financial institution's financial
17 safety and soundness, which would in turn hamper consumers'
18 abilities to obtain financing to purchase dwellings of their
19 own. This measure establishes the condominium loan program, to
20 be administered by the Hawaii green infrastructure authority, to
21 provide financing for condominium associations to address

1 deferred maintenance or repair issues and to further help
2 stabilize the standard property insurance market in the State by
3 mitigating future claims.
4 The legislature notes that the wildfire in Lahaina, Maui,
5 on August 8, 2023, has also impacted the way reinsurers and
6 standard insurers view Hawaii's wildfire risk. The president of
7 Insurance Associates estimates that while Hawaii has always been
8 rated for hurricanes for property insurance purposes, it has
9 never been rated for wildfires. Now that the State has
10 experienced wildfires, not only in Lahaina, but also in Kula,
11 West Oahu, and Mililani, parts of all islands will be rated for
12 wildfires. Moreover, it is surmised that some insurers will not
13 maintain their current policy-count in the State because of
14 their increased costs for reinsurance, geographical
15 concentration of risk, and inadequate rates both pre- and
16 post-wildfire. Insurers have the financial responsibility to
17 pay losses, and if reinsurance and premiums are not sufficient
18 to cover these losses, an insurer needs to reduce their exposure
19 by restricting new policies, reducing their policy-count, or
20 both. The legislature recognizes that the price impact on
2025-2834 SB1044 CDl SMA-4.docx 6

Page 7
S.B. NO. Si
C.D. 1
1 reinsurance from recent wildfires is not fully known and price
2 increases may continue into the foreseeable future.
3 The legislature also understands that the market for
4 reinsurance, the insurance that property and casualty insurance
5 companies pay to share their risk, is global. Therefore, storms
6 and other catastrophic losses occurring anywhere in the world
7 may potentially impact the amounts that homeowners and
8 condominium associations in Hawaii pay for their insurance
9 coverage.
10 The legislature also acknowledges that although insurance
11 coverage, excluding hurricane coverage, for condominium
12 buildings is available in the standard insurance market, the
13 availability of this coverage is not guaranteed. If this
14 coverage became unavailable to condominium buildings, then under
15 this Act, the Hawaii property insurance association would be
16 authorized to provide this coverage.
17 This Act expands the authority of these State-established
18 insurance entities to assist in the stabilization of the
19 property insurance market until risks can be depopulated back to
20 the standard insurance market when market conditions improve and
21 risks become more insurable because of building component

1 replacement or maintenance, or mitigation equipment or protocols
2 have been implemented for fire, wildfire, or hurricane events.
3 The legislature also recognizes that, although there has
4 been much focus on the instability of the condominium insurance
5 market in Hawaii, the broader property insurance industry faces
6 uncertainty amidst changing economic and regulatory conditions,
7 rising costs, increased reinsurance costs, and more frequent
8 severe weather events. Given these precarious conditions, it is
9 possible that a future disaster or other unforeseen circumstance
10 could cause the availability of insurance to shrink for classes
11 of real property other than condominiums, including
12 single-family homes and townhouses.
13 Accordingly, this Act authorizes the Hawaii property
14 insurance association to provide additional insurance coverage
15 within the State for certain categories of properties if the
16 Hawaii property insurance association and insurance commissioner
17 determine that those categories of properties are experiencing a
18 casualty and property insurance market failure. This authority
19 will provide the Hawaii property insurance association with the
20 flexibility to quickly address potential future disruptions in
21 the insurance market. This flexibility is critical to ensure
2025-2834 SB1044 GDI SMA-4.docx

Page 9 S.B. NO. ^2
C.D. 1
1 that Hawaii residents living in non-condominium properties such
2 as single-family homes and townhouses are protected following
3 unexpected disasters that could otherwise increase the cost of
4 insurance to the point where residents cannot afford to continue
5 living in their homes or in the State.
6 The legislature believes that it is critical to begin the
7 process to adequately capitalize the Hawaii property insurance
8 association and Hawaii hurricane relief fund because insuring
9 these risks could bring an enormous amount of risk exposure to
10 the funds. Therefore, funding mechanisms must be broad on an
11 initial and ongoing basis and spread among as many parties
12 involved in real property transactions within the State as
13 possible to ensure that the financial impacts are apportioned as
14 equitably as practicable, and that reserve funds are adequately
15 capitalized if losses exceed the funds' capacities.
16 In the past, the Hawaii hurricane relief fund was funded in
17 part through the special mortgage recording fee, which was
18 imposed on each mortgage recorded with the bureau of
19 conveyances. The legislature recognizes concerns that the
20 special mortgage recording fee is regressive because homebuyers
21 who need to finance more of their purchase price are assessed
2025-2834 SB1044 CDl SMA-4.docx

Page 10
S.B. NO. s"
H.D. 2
C.D. 1
1 proportionally more than buyers who need to finance less or who
2 can afford to complete their purchase using cash.
3 Therefore, this Act repeals the special mortgage recording
4 fee and instead authorizes the Hawaii hurricane relief fund
5 board of directors, subject to the approval of the insurance
6 commissioner, to establish a temporary recording fee, which will
7 be imposed as a flat assessment on each document that is
8 recorded with the bureau of conveyances or filed with the
9 assistant registrar of the land court of the State, as
10 appropriate. This fee, if activated by the Hawaii hurricane
11 relief fund and approved by the insurance commissioner, is
12 intended to be a temporary funding mechanism that will spread
13 costs out in a way that will reduce the regressive financial
14 impact imposed on individuals and families who can only afford
15 to purchase a residential dwelling by financing the purchase.
16 If the Hawaii hurricane relief fund board of directors
17 determines that the fee revenue is no longer required, this Act
18 allows the board to terminate collection of the fee without
19 seeking legislative action.
20 This Act provides additional funding mechanisms through
21 the:

1 (1) Appropriation of general funds; and
2 (2) Option for the Hawaii hurricane relief fund to
3 reactivate the assessment of insurers at an assessment
4 rate determined by the Hawaii hurricane relief fund's
5 board of directors to augment the capitalization of
6 the Hawaii hurricane relief fund.
7 The legislature finds that this Act is necessary to:
8 (1) Stabilize the property insurance market so that
9 insurers continue to insure properties in the State;
10 (2) Ensure access to adequate property insurance for
11 certain properties located within the State to allow
12 lenders to finance mortgages that meet the
13 requirements of the secondary mortgage market; and
14 (3) Serve an important public purpose.
15 This Act is a stop-gap measure to provide insurance
16 availability for condominium associations that are unable to
17 purchase adequate property insurance for their respective
18 condominium buildings that are in insurable condition.
19 Condominium associations that apply for coverage through the
20 Hawaii property insurance association will need to pay premiums
21 that are sufficient to cover the condominium association's

1 exposure to losses. This measure is not designed to be a
2 long-term solution, and therefore the legislature has imposed a
3 one-time five-year coverage period and commissioned a study to
4 recommend long-term solutions to stabilize the property
5 insurance market in the State. To that end, in addition to
6 providing for the issuance of short-term property insurance
7 coverage, this Act also effectively requires the insurance
8 commissioner to conduct a study to develop a long-term solution.
9 The legislature notes that a long-term solution may potentially
10 include the issuance of property insurance policies for
11 condominium buildings that are in need of repair or replacement
12 of components.
13 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
14 (1) Amend state laws governing the Hawaii property
15 insurance association and the Hawaii hurricane relief
16 fund to enable these entities to underwrite certain
17 insurance risks in the State that no standard insurer
18 is currently willing to underwrite;
19 (2) Establish a condominium loan program and condominium
20 loan revolving fund to provide qualified condominium

5 institutions to provide loans at competitive rates and
6 terms to condominium associations to allow the
7 associations to perform necessary maintenance or make
8 repairs;

10 to monitor and identify the most effective methods of
11 stabilizing the property insurance market in the
12 State; and
13 (5) Appropriate funds.

5 "High-rise condominium" means a condominium that has four
6 or more stories that contain units that are or can be occupied
7 by a person.
8 "Property insurance" means policies, riders, or
9 endorsements of insurance that provide indemnity, in whole or in
10 part, for the loss, destruction, or damage of property and
11 against legal liability for the death, injury, or disability of
12 any human being, or from damage to property. "Property
13 insurance" does not include any indemnity for loss, destruction,
14 damage of property, or death, injury, or disability of any human
15 being, or from damage to property, caused by a hurricane."
