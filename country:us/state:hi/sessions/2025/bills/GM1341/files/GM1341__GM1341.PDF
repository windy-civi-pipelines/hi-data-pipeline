THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE. 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the State is
2 committed to promoting sustainable economic development,
3 enhancing local food production, improving access to healthy
4 food, promoting climate change adaptation and mitigation,
5 minimizing food waste, and reducing food insecurity. This
6 commitment is evident through initiatives such as:
7 (1) The Hawaii 2050 sustainability plan, which highlights
8 Hawaii's overall economic, climate, and food
9 system-related goals;
10 (2) Act 151, Session Laws of Hawaii 2019, which mandates
11 doubling local food production and increasing food
12 exports by 2030; and
13 (3) Acts 175 and 176, Session Laws of Hawaii 2021, which
14 establish goals for local food procurement in schools
15 and other government entities, with a target of fifty
16 per cent locally sourced food by 2050.

C.D. 1
1 Despite these efforts and more, high food insecurity and
2 barriers to local food production in Hawaii remain. According
3 to a recent report by the Hawaii Foodbank, nearly one-third of
4 households are food insecure, and food insecurity rates are
5 consistently higher than the national average. Additionally, a
6 recent study found that only twelve per cent of households
7 maintain a fourteen-day emergency supply of food, water, and
8 medicine, as recommended by emergency managers.
9 The legislature further finds that achieving a sustainable,
10 resilient, and equitable food system requires collaboration
11 across state agencies, producers, retailers, non-governmental
12 organizations, and community members. Such a system can enhance
13 environmental, economic, social, and cultural health;
14 well-being; and equity while also helping the State respond
15 effectively to disasters and crises. Interagency coordination
16 and an integrated approach are essential to maximizing
17 efficiencies and achieving impact.
18 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
19 (1) Establish a statewide interagency food systems
20 coordination team and an interagency food systems
