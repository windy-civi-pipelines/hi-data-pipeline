Section 1:
SB519 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 519 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to aquatic life. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the division of aquatic resources (DAR) of the department of land and natural resources requires a special activity permit for each collection of any form of marine life taken from within the West Hawaii regional fisheries management area. Existing language requires the DAR to issue a special activity permit for the collection of aquatic life for all purposes, including aquaculture breeding purposes.  This requirement overburdens the DAR and creates unreasonable delays that hinder aquacultural research. Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to require the department of the land and natural resources to amend the definition of "aquarium purposes" in Hawaii Administrative Rules to allow for a bona fide aquaculture entity or a bona fide scientific research entity to collect aquatic life without a permit; provided that the aquatic life remains in the county in which it was collected while it is alive. SECTION 2. The department of land and natural resources shall amend the definition of "aquarium purposes" in section 13-60.4-3, Hawaii Administrative Rules to mean: "to hold aquatic life alive in a state of captivity, whether as pets, for public exhibition, or for sale for these purposes, except where aquatic life is collected by a bona fide aquaculture entity or a bona fide scientific research entity and remains in the county in which the aquatic life was collected while the aquatic life is alive." SECTION 3. This Act shall take effect upon its approval. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: DLNR; Division of Aquatic Resources; Marine Resources; Aquaculture Description: Requires the Department of Land and Natural Resources to amend the definition of "aquarium purposes", in Hawaii Administrative Rules, to allow a bona fide aquaculture entity or scientific research entity to collect aquatic life without a permit so long as the aquatic life remains in the county in which it was collected while it is alive.
