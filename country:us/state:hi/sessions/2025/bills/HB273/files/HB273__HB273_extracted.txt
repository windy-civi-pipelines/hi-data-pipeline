HB273 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 273 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to school choice scholarship program. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1. The legislature finds that public schools in Hawaii are experiencing overcrowding. Campbell High School, with more than three thousand students, is a notable example of overcrowding. Alternative education options such as private schools and charter schools help alleviate the pressure on the public school system.  Further, parents should have the right to choose which educational setting their children should learn in.  The overwhelming financial burden of private and charter education is a primary hurdle preventing parents from exercising their autonomy over their children's education. The State of Hawaii spends between $15,000 and $17,000 per child per year for public education.  The legislature finds that offering a scholarship of less than the State's annual expenditure per child is a cost-effective method of alleviating overburdened public schools and promoting parental choice. The purpose of this Act is to offer families an educational choice through the provision of funds for nonpublic school tuition and fees.  This program will assist students in their endeavors to become well-educated and productive members of society.  The provisions of this Act are in the public interest, for the public benefit, and serve a secular public purpose. SECTION 2.  Chapter 302A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part .School choice scholarship §302A-A   Definitions.  For the purposes of this section: "Board" means the board of education.
