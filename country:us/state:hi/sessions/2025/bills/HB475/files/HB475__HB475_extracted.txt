Section 1:
HB475 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 475 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO common interest ownership communities. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that due to the effects of climate change and the establishment of more stringent structural facility maintenance requirements, it is more important than ever that common interest ownership communities, including homeowners' associations, planned community associations, cooperative housing corporations, and condominium unit owners' associations, are properly managed to protect the life and safety of residents in these communities. The legislature further finds that an estimated three hundred sixty thousand people in the State, or about one in four persons, live in a common interest ownership community managed by these types of associations.  These individuals live in projects governed by volunteer boards of directors who often have limited expertise in financing, property management, or engineering. Therefore, it is crucial that the professional association managers hired to manage the day-to-day operations of common interest ownership communities possess the specialized knowledge and expertise required to properly service these entities. The legislature also finds that one way to ensure that association managers are qualified is by establishing licensing requirements.  The establishment of licensing requirements for association managers will increase accountability, improve the safety of residents, guests, and property, and will help to standardize the long-term repair and maintenance obligations in common interest ownership communities.  Empowering a licensing board to monitor this profession will also help to ensure boards of directors and individual better understand the long-term financial obligations required for the common interest ownership communities in which they reside. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish licensing and regulation requirements for managers of homeowners' associations, planned community associations, cooperative housing corporations, and condominium unit owners' associations. SECTION 2.  The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to title 25 to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Chapter MANAGERS of homeowners associations, planned community associations, cooperative housing corporations, and condominium unit owners' associations §   -1  Definitions.  As used in this chapter: "Association" includes homeowners' associations and planned community associations governed under chapter 421J, cooperative housing corporations governed under chapter 421I, and condominium unit owners' associations governed under chapter 514B. "Association manager" means any person, regardless of that person's title, who is hired or contracted by an association to oversee the daily operations of the association, including managing the association's budget, collecting dues, managing delinquencies, bookkeeping, maintaining common areas, performing site inspections, complying with applicable laws, hiring association employees, updating and maintaining insurance policies, enforcing governing documents, performing dispute resolution, and managing vendors. "Board" means the association manager licensing board. "Department" means the department of commerce and consumer affairs. §   -2  License required.  (a) Beginning July 1, 2027, it shall be unlawful for any person to be employed or contracted by an association as an association manager without having first obtained a license as provided in this chapter. (b)  Any person who violates this section shall be subject to a fine of not more than $           for each separate offense.  Each day of each violation shall constitute a separate offense. §   -3  Exemptions.  This chapter shall not apply to any employee or contractor of an association manager who works under the supervision or direction of a person who is licensed under this chapter. §   -4  Association manager licensing board; established; organization; powers.
