Section 1:
SB1177 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1177 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT Relating to Search and Rescue. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  This Act shall be known and cited as the "Hawaii State Search and Rescue Coordinator Act". SECTION 2. The legislature finds that Hawaii's unique geographic conditions, including seven hundred fifty miles of coastline and 3,800,000 acres of undeveloped property, pose significant challenges for search and rescue operations.  Current search and rescue operations in Hawaii are fragmented, involving multiple agencies having varying standards and protocols, leading to inefficiencies and safety risks. The legislature further finds that Hawaii is among the states having the highest rates of missing persons, necessitating improved oversight and accountability for search and rescue activities.  Recent data highlights a lack of funding, tools, training, and technology for statewide search and rescue operations, contributing to delayed responses and compromised outcomes. The legislature recognizes that the establishment of an office of the state search and rescue coordinator would ensure a centralized authority for search and rescue operations; unified communication and collaboration among all participating federal, state, and county agencies and volunteer organizations; adequate training and resources to improve search and rescue outcomes and reduce costs; oversight of resource allocation and deployment; and enhanced public safety through streamlined processes. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to enhance public safety and improve the coordination, efficiency, and effectiveness of search and rescue operations throughout the State by establishing within the office of the state fire marshal the office of the state search and rescue coordinator.      SECTION 3.
