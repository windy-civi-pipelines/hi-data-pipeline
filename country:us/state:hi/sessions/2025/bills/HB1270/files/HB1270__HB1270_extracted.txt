Section 1:
HB1270 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1270 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO ACCESSIBILITY. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that parking is too limited for disabled people and kupuna. High tourism, a primary economic driver, also reduces the ability for disabled people and kupuna to find parking. According to the Hawaii disability and communication access board, approximately eight per cent of Hawaii's population has a mobility disability significant enough to qualify for a disability parking permit.  Being unable to park limits public interactions making disabled and elderly neighbors less integrated in the community.  Disabled people who are forced to park further away from a business are not able to easily access facilities, and therefore have an increased risk of falling which is the leading cause of death from injury among adults aged sixty-five and older. The legislature further finds that our community must strive to uphold access for disabled and elderly persons, especially as our islands have high traffic and tourism, making parking notoriously lacking for all. The purpose of this Act is to increase the number of federally mandated disability parking spots by a minimum of one or fifty per cent, whichever is greater, in all public lots, including business lots, with more than twenty-five parking stalls.  This Act is crafted so as not to burden small businesses with under twenty-five spots, which may lack the ability to expand disabled stalls in their lots. SECTION 2.  Section 291-58, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "[[]§291-58[]]  Requirement to provide parking for persons with disabilities; penalty.  (a)  Beginning July 1, 2002, any public or private entity that provides a parking space reserved for persons with disabilities shall comply with this part and any administrative rules adopted under this part. (b) Beginning July 1, 2026, any public or private entity that operates a public lot, including a business lot, that provides more than twenty-five parking spaces shall increase the number of federally mandated parking spaces reserved for persons with disabilities by a minimum of one or fifty per cent, whichever is greater. (c) A private entity that fails to comply with this section shall be fined [not] no less than $250 nor more than $500 for each separate offense.  Each day of violation shall constitute a separate offense.  Any action taken to impose or collect any penalty provided for in this section shall be considered a civil action." SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: Parking; Persons with Disabilities Description: Beginning 7/1/26, requires any public or private entity that operates a public lot, including a business lot, that provides more than 25 parking spaces to increase the number of federally mandated parking spaces reserved for persons with disabilities by a minimum of one or fifty per cent, whichever is greater.
