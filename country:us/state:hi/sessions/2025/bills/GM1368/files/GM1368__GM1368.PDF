THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO NURSING.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that Hawaii faces a
2 growing nursing workforce shortage, with the current demand for
3 nurses exceeding supply by approximately one thousand positions.
4 Experts have recommended expanding the capacity of university
5 nursing programs to help reduce nursing workforce shortages.
6 The legislature further finds that the county of Maui is
7 the largest county in the State without a college or university
8 bachelor of science in nursing degree program. The university
9 of Hawaii Maui college's nursing program offers two degrees: a
10 certificate of achievement and an associate in science in
11 nursing. Students who earn an associate in science in nursing
12 must then transfer to the bachelor of science in nursing pathway
13 at the university of Hawaii at Manoa to further their education.
14 The legislature believes that offering a bachelor of
15 science in nursing program at the university of Hawaii Maui
16 college can help to increase the supply of nurse graduates,
