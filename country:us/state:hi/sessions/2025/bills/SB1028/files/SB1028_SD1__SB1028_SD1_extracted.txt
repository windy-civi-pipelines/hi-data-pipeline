Section 1:
SB1028 SD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1028 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO YOUTH FEES AND FINES. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that charging fees, fines, and court costs to youth is harmful to young people and their families.  In the State, the consequences of these costs fall disproportionately on Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Black youth, who are more likely to be arrested, detained, and unable to afford fees and fines.  The legislature also finds that, although existing law authorizes courts to charge youth and their families a range of fees and fines, judges across the State rarely impose these costs in practice. The legislature recognizes that assessing fines in juvenile justice proceedings is not an evidence-based practice for rehabilitating, deterring, or even punishing delinquent youth.  Parents may be forced to choose between paying court costs or meeting basic needs.  The economic burdens placed on juveniles and their families can undermine public safety by leading to recidivism and escalating crime.  Additionally, jurisdictions on the mainland that charge fines and fees to minors often spend more money trying to collect those outstanding debts than they receive in revenue. The legislature notes that many states are seeking to reform or repeal fines and fees against juveniles and their families. In 2021 and 2022, twenty-seven states introduced legislation to end the practice of assessing fines and fees in juvenile justice proceedings.  California, Nevada, Oregon, and numerous counties in other states have prohibited the imposition of fees and fines in juvenile justice cases.  The legislature believes that the State should make similar efforts and that fees and fines should not be assessed for mistakes made in a person's youth, regardless of the age at which or jurisdiction in which the person is adjudicated or sentenced. The legislature further finds that data from January 2019 through September 2024, shows that only thirty-two per cent of restitution ordered by the courts against minors was paid during that six-year period.  Excluding payments for restitution, only seventeen per cent of fines ordered by the courts against minors was paid during that same timeframe. The data reflects that minors and their parents, the large majority of which are Native Hawaiian, are struggling to cover the exorbitant debt assessed to them by the courts. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to allow a court to order community service in place of the assessment of any fines and fees against a person who is adjudicated for a traffic offense committed while the person was a minor under the age of eighteen years, or against the person's parent or guardian. PART II SECTION 2.  Section 286-136, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended as follows: 1. By amending subsection (a) to read: "(a) Any person who violates section 286-102, 286-122, 286-130, 286-131, 286-132, 286-133, or 286-134 shall be penalized as follows: (1)  For a first offense, or any offense not preceded within a five-year period for the same offense, the person shall pay a fine of [no] not more than $1,000 or serve a term of imprisonment of [no] not more than thirty days, or both; (2)  For an offense that occurs within five years of a prior conviction for the same offense, the person shall pay a minimum fine of $500 and a maximum fine of $1,000, or serve a term of imprisonment of [no] not more than one year, or both; or (3)  For an offense that occurs within five years of two or more prior convictions for the same offense, the person shall be guilty of a class C felony; provided that the court, as part of the person's sentencing, may order that the vehicle used by the person in the commission of the offense be subject to forfeiture under chapter 712A." 2.  By amending subsection (c) to read: "(c)  Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), a minor under the age of eighteen years under the jurisdiction of the family court who is subject to this section [shall either]: (1)  May lose the right to drive a motor vehicle until the age of eighteen [or be subject to a fine of $500.] years; and (2)  In place of any financial penalty provided for in this section against a person who is adjudicated of an offense committed while the person was a minor under the age of eighteen years, or against the person's parent or guardian for the person's offense, the court may order the person to participate in community service of not more than seventy-two hours; provided that the community service shall not interfere with the person's school or work commitments."

Raw Text:
SB1028 SD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1028 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO YOUTH FEES AND FINES. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that charging fees, fines, and court costs to youth is harmful to young people and their families.  In the State, the consequences of these costs fall disproportionately on Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Black youth, who are more likely to be arrested, detained, and unable to afford fees and fines.  The legislature also finds that, although existing law authorizes courts to charge youth and their families a range of fees and fines, judges across the State rarely impose these costs in practice. The legislature recognizes that assessing fines in juvenile justice proceedings is not an evidence-based practice for rehabilitating, deterring, or even punishing delinquent youth.  Parents may be forced to choose between paying court costs or meeting basic needs.  The economic burdens placed on juveniles and their families can undermine public safety by leading to recidivism and escalating crime.  Additionally, jurisdictions on the mainland that charge fines and fees to minors often spend more money trying to collect those outstanding debts than they receive in revenue. The legislature notes that many states are seeking to reform or repeal fines and fees against juveniles and their families. In 2021 and 2022, twenty-seven states introduced legislation to end the practice of assessing fines and fees in juvenile justice proceedings.  California, Nevada, Oregon, and numerous counties in other states have prohibited the imposition of fees and fines in juvenile justice cases.  The legislature believes that the State should make similar efforts and that fees and fines should not be assessed for mistakes made in a person's youth, regardless of the age at which or jurisdiction in which the person is adjudicated or sentenced. The legislature further finds that data from January 2019 through September 2024, shows that only thirty-two per cent of restitution ordered by the courts against minors was paid during that six-year period.  Excluding payments for restitution, only seventeen per cent of fines ordered by the courts against minors was paid during that same timeframe. The data reflects that minors and their parents, the large majority of which are Native Hawaiian, are struggling to cover the exorbitant debt assessed to them by the courts. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to allow a court to order community service in place of the assessment of any fines and fees against a person who is adjudicated for a traffic offense committed while the person was a minor under the age of eighteen years, or against the person's parent or guardian. PART II SECTION 2.  Section 286-136, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended as follows: 1. By amending subsection (a) to read: "(a) Any person who violates section 286-102, 286-122, 286-130, 286-131, 286-132, 286-133, or 286-134 shall be penalized as follows: (1)  For a first offense, or any offense not preceded within a five-year period for the same offense, the person shall pay a fine of [no] not more than $1,000 or serve a term of imprisonment of [no] not more than thirty days, or both; (2)  For an offense that occurs within five years of a prior conviction for the same offense, the person shall pay a minimum fine of $500 and a maximum fine of $1,000, or serve a term of imprisonment of [no] not more than one year, or both; or (3)  For an offense that occurs within five years of two or more prior convictions for the same offense, the person shall be guilty of a class C felony; provided that the court, as part of the person's sentencing, may order that the vehicle used by the person in the commission of the offense be subject to forfeiture under chapter 712A." 2.  By amending subsection (c) to read: "(c)  Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), a minor under the age of eighteen years under the jurisdiction of the family court who is subject to this section [shall either]: (1)  May lose the right to drive a motor vehicle until the age of eighteen [or be subject to a fine of $500.] years; and (2)  In place of any financial penalty provided for in this section against a person who is adjudicated of an offense committed while the person was a minor under the age of eighteen years, or against the person's parent or guardian for the person's offense, the court may order the person to participate in community service of not more than seventy-two hours; provided that the community service shall not interfere with the person's school or work commitments."
