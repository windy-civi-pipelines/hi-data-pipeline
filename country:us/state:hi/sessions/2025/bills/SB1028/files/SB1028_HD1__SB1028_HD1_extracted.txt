SB1028 HD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1028 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO YOUTH FEES AND FINES. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that charging fees, fines, and court costs to youth is a harmful and ineffective accountability practice.  In Hawaii, the consequences of these costs fall disproportionately on Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander minors who are more likely to be arrested, detained, and unable to afford fees and fines.  In a report on the assessment of fees, fines, court costs, and restitution in cases against minors, the judiciary confirmed that only seventeen per cent of fines ordered against minors in the past five years have been paid. The legislature recognizes that assessing fines in juvenile justice proceedings is not an evidence-based practice for rehabilitating, deterring, or even punishing delinquent youth.  The legislature further finds that, although Hawaii law authorizes courts to charge youth and their families a range of fines, judges across the State rarely impose these costs in practice. The legislature notes that many states are seeking to reform or repeal fees and fines against juveniles and their families. In 2021 and 2022, twenty-seven states introduced legislation to end the practice of assessing fees and fines in juvenile justice proceedings.  California, Nevada, Oregon, and numerous counties in other states have prohibited the imposition of fees and fines in juvenile justice cases.  The legislature believes that Hawaii should make similar efforts and that fees and fines should not be assessed for mistakes made in a person's youth, regardless of the age at which or jurisdiction in which the person is adjudicated or sentenced. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Prohibit the assessment of any fees, fines, or court costs against a person who is adjudicated for an offense committed while the person was a minor under the age of eighteen, or against the person's parent or guardian; (2)  Limit court-ordered community service for a minor to no more than seventy-two hours; and (3)  Repeal certain penalties imposed on parents, guardians, or other persons associated with unaccompanied children in streets and unmarried minors in dance halls. PART II SECTION 2.  Section 286-136, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended as follows: 1.  By amending subsection (a) to read: "(a)  [Any] Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), any person who violates section 286-102, 286-122, 286‑130, 286-131, 286-132, 286-133, or 286-134 shall be penalized as follows: (1)  For a first offense, or any offense not preceded within a five-year period for the same offense, the person shall pay a fine of no more than $1,000 or serve a term of imprisonment of no more than thirty days, or both; (2)  For an offense that occurs within five years of a prior conviction for the same offense, the person shall pay a minimum fine of $500 and a maximum fine of $1,000, or serve a term of imprisonment of no more than one year, or both; or (3)  For an offense that occurs within five years of two or more prior convictions for the same offense, the person shall be guilty of a class C felony; provided that the court, as part of the person's sentencing, may order that the vehicle used by the person in the commission of the offense be subject to forfeiture under chapter 712A." 2.  By amending subsection (c) to read: "(c)  Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), a minor under the age of eighteen [under the jurisdiction of the family court] who is subject to this section [shall] may either lose the right to drive a motor vehicle until the age of eighteen or be [subject to a fine of $500.] ordered to perform community service of no more than seventy-two hours as determined by the court; provided that the community service shall not interfere with the minor's school or work commitments; provided further that no financial penalty provided for in this section shall be levied against a person who is adjudicated for an offense committed while the person was a minor under the age of eighteen, or against the person's parent or guardian for the person's offense."

If the parent wilfully fails or refuses to pay such sum, the court may proceed against the parent as for contempt, or the order may be filed and shall have the effect of a civil judgment.] The court shall not order the parent or guardian of a person adjudicated under section 571-11(1) or (2), 571-13, 571-22, or 571-41(f) to pay for the person's support and treatment; provided that the court may order the person or the person's parent or guardian to utilize treatment options available to the person or the person's parent or guardian through any health insurance under which the person is already a covered person or beneficiary; provided further that the person or the person's parent or guardian shall be responsible for all copayments required by the insurer.

Raw Text:
SB1028 HD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1028 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO YOUTH FEES AND FINES. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that charging fees, fines, and court costs to youth is a harmful and ineffective accountability practice.  In Hawaii, the consequences of these costs fall disproportionately on Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander minors who are more likely to be arrested, detained, and unable to afford fees and fines.  In a report on the assessment of fees, fines, court costs, and restitution in cases against minors, the judiciary confirmed that only seventeen per cent of fines ordered against minors in the past five years have been paid. The legislature recognizes that assessing fines in juvenile justice proceedings is not an evidence-based practice for rehabilitating, deterring, or even punishing delinquent youth.  The legislature further finds that, although Hawaii law authorizes courts to charge youth and their families a range of fines, judges across the State rarely impose these costs in practice. The legislature notes that many states are seeking to reform or repeal fees and fines against juveniles and their families. In 2021 and 2022, twenty-seven states introduced legislation to end the practice of assessing fees and fines in juvenile justice proceedings.  California, Nevada, Oregon, and numerous counties in other states have prohibited the imposition of fees and fines in juvenile justice cases.  The legislature believes that Hawaii should make similar efforts and that fees and fines should not be assessed for mistakes made in a person's youth, regardless of the age at which or jurisdiction in which the person is adjudicated or sentenced. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Prohibit the assessment of any fees, fines, or court costs against a person who is adjudicated for an offense committed while the person was a minor under the age of eighteen, or against the person's parent or guardian; (2)  Limit court-ordered community service for a minor to no more than seventy-two hours; and (3)  Repeal certain penalties imposed on parents, guardians, or other persons associated with unaccompanied children in streets and unmarried minors in dance halls. PART II SECTION 2.  Section 286-136, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended as follows: 1.  By amending subsection (a) to read: "(a)  [Any] Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), any person who violates section 286-102, 286-122, 286‑130, 286-131, 286-132, 286-133, or 286-134 shall be penalized as follows: (1)  For a first offense, or any offense not preceded within a five-year period for the same offense, the person shall pay a fine of no more than $1,000 or serve a term of imprisonment of no more than thirty days, or both; (2)  For an offense that occurs within five years of a prior conviction for the same offense, the person shall pay a minimum fine of $500 and a maximum fine of $1,000, or serve a term of imprisonment of no more than one year, or both; or (3)  For an offense that occurs within five years of two or more prior convictions for the same offense, the person shall be guilty of a class C felony; provided that the court, as part of the person's sentencing, may order that the vehicle used by the person in the commission of the offense be subject to forfeiture under chapter 712A." 2.  By amending subsection (c) to read: "(c)  Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), a minor under the age of eighteen [under the jurisdiction of the family court] who is subject to this section [shall] may either lose the right to drive a motor vehicle until the age of eighteen or be [subject to a fine of $500.] ordered to perform community service of no more than seventy-two hours as determined by the court; provided that the community service shall not interfere with the minor's school or work commitments; provided further that no financial penalty provided for in this section shall be levied against a person who is adjudicated for an offense committed while the person was a minor under the age of eighteen, or against the person's parent or guardian for the person's offense." SECTION 3.  Section 286G-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§286G-3 Driver education assessments.

(c)  The driver education assessments levied by subsections (a) and (b) shall be paid for each violation in addition to any fine imposed by the court, and regardless of whether a fine is suspended; provided that the driver education assessment of $100 levied on a person convicted under section 291E-61 or 291E-61.5 may be waived by the court if the court determines that the person is unable to pay the driver education assessment. (d)  The amount of each driver education assessment levied by subsections (a) and (b) shall be transmitted by the clerk of the court for deposit in the driver education and training fund. (e)  No financial penalty provided for in this section shall be levied against a person who is adjudicated for an offense committed while the person was a minor under the age of eighteen, or against the person's parent or guardian for the person's offense."

If legal custody of the child is vested in a private agency or institution in another state, the court shall select one that is approved by the family or juvenile court of the other state or by that state's department of social services or other appropriate department; (C)  The court may place a child on administrative monitoring, as defined in section 571-2, pending completion of conditions as may be imposed by the court, to preempt the need for disposition to a full probation term, and to afford the child the opportunity to demonstrate behavior adjustments.  Upon completion of the court-ordered conditions, the court shall discharge the child pursuant to section 571-50.  If a child fails to complete the court-ordered conditions, the court may extend or modify the order pursuant to section 571-50, or [dispose] place the child [to] on probation status under paragraph (1)(A); or (D)  [The court may fine the child for] For a violation [which] that would be theft in the third degree by shoplifting if committed by an adult[.  The], the court may require the child to perform [public services in lieu of the fine;] community service of no more than seventy-two hours; provided that the community service shall not interfere with the child's school or work commitments.  The court shall not impose a fine on the child or the child's parent or guardian; (2)  As to a child adjudicated under section 571-11(2): (A)  The court may place the child under protective supervision, as hereinabove defined, in the child's own home, or in the custody of a suitable person or agency elsewhere, upon conditions determined by the court; or (B)  The court may vest legal custody of the child, after prior consultation with the agency or institution, in a local governmental agency or institution licensed or approved by the State to care for children, with the exception of an institution authorized by the court to care for children.  If legal custody of the child is vested in a private agency or institution in another state, the court shall select one that is approved by the family or juvenile court of the other state or by that state's department of social services or other appropriate department; provided that the child [may] shall not be committed to a public or private institution operated solely for the treatment of law violators; (3)  An order vesting legal custody of a minor in an individual, agency, or institution under section 571‑11(2) shall be for an indeterminate period but shall not remain in force or effect beyond three years from the date entered, except that the individual, institution, or agency may file with the court a petition for renewal of the order and the court may renew the order if it finds [such] the renewal necessary to safeguard the welfare of the child or the public interest.  The court, after notice to the parties, may conduct a hearing on the petition. Renewal may be periodic during minority, but no order shall have any force or effect beyond the period authorized by section 571-13.  An agency granted legal custody shall be subject to prior approval of the court in any case in which the child is to reside without the territorial jurisdiction of the court and may be subject to prior approval in other cases.  An individual granted legal custody shall exercise the rights and responsibilities personally unless otherwise authorized by the court; (4)  Whenever the court commits a child to the care of the director of human services or executive director of the office of youth services, or vests legal custody of a child in an institution or agency, it shall transmit with the order copies of the clinical reports, social study, results of the risk and needs assessment conducted by the court, and other information pertinent to the care and treatment of the child, and the institution or agency shall give to the court any information concerning the child that the court may at any time require. An institution or agency receiving a child under this paragraph shall inform the court whenever the status of the child is affected through temporary or permanent release, discharge, or transfer to other custody.  An institution to which a child is committed under section 571-11(1) or (2) shall not transfer custody of the child to an institution for the correction of adult offenders, except as authorized in this chapter and under chapter 352; (5)  The court may order, for any child within its jurisdiction, whatever care or treatment is authorized by law; (6)  In placing a child under the guardianship or custody of an individual or of a private agency or private institution, the court shall give primary consideration to the welfare of the child; (7)  In support of any order or decree under section 571‑11(1) or (2), the court may require the parents or other persons having custody of the child, or any other person who has been found by the court to be encouraging, causing, or contributing to the acts or conditions [which] that bring the child within the purview of this chapter and who are parties to the proceeding, to do or to omit doing any acts required or forbidden by law, when the judge deems this requirement necessary for the welfare of the child.  The court may also make appropriate orders concerning the parents or other persons having custody of the child and who are parties to the proceeding.  If such persons fail to comply with the requirement or with the court order, the court may proceed against them for contempt of court; (8)  In support of any order or decree for custody or support, the court may make an order of protection setting forth reasonable conditions of behavior to be observed for a specified time, binding upon both parents or either of them. This order may require either parent to stay away from the home or from the other parent or children, may permit the other to visit the children at stated periods, or may require a parent to abstain from offensive conduct against the children or each other; (9)  The court may dismiss the petition or otherwise terminate its jurisdiction at any time; (10)  In any other case of which the court has jurisdiction, the court may make any order or judgment authorized by law; (11)  The court may order any person adjudicated pursuant to section 571-11(1) to make restitution of money or services to any victim who suffers loss as a result of the child's action, or to render community service[;] of no more than seventy-two hours; provided that the community service shall not interfere with the child's school or work commitments; (12)  The court may order any [person] child adjudicated pursuant to section 571-11(2) to participate in community service[; and] of no more than seventy-two hours; provided that the community service shall not interfere with the child's school or work commitments; (13)  The court may order the parents of an adjudicated child to make restitution of money or services to any victim, person, or party who has incurred a loss or damages as a result of the child's action[.]; and (14)  Notwithstanding paragraph (11) or (13), the court shall not impose any financial penalties or seek reimbursement for costs against the adjudicated child or the child's parent or guardian."

If the parent wilfully fails or refuses to pay such sum, the court may proceed against the parent as for contempt, or the order may be filed and shall have the effect of a civil judgment.] The court shall not order the parent or guardian of a person adjudicated under section 571-11(1) or (2), 571-13, 571-22, or 571-41(f) to pay for the person's support and treatment; provided that the court may order the person or the person's parent or guardian to utilize treatment options available to the person or the person's parent or guardian through any health insurance under which the person is already a covered person or beneficiary; provided further that the person or the person's parent or guardian shall be responsible for all copayments required by the insurer.
