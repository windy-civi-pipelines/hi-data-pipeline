A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS RELATED TO THE MAUI WILDFIRES.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the payment of state
2 moneys to a fund established to pay claims related to the
3 devastating 2023 Maui wildfires, as those claims are compromised
4 and settled, serves a public purpose and is for the public
5 health, safety, and general welfare of the State for the
6 following reasons:
7 (1) The 2023 Maui wildfires had a devastating impact on
8 the residents of Maui, resulting in real and personal
9 property damage, personal injury, wrongful death,
10 emotional distress and inconvenience, and economic
11 loss;
12 (2) Establishing a trust fund to allow the State to
13 respond with compassion and support for those affected
14 by the 2023 Maui wildfires, ensuring that victims or
15 their personal representatives are provided with fair
16 and just compensation on a timely basis, is in the
17 public interest;

1 (3) Contributing state funds to be used along with
2 contributions from others, including the county of
3 Maui, Hawaiian Electric, Kamehameha Schools, Charter
4 Communications/Spectrum, Hawaiian Telcom, and West
5 Maui Land Company, for the compromise and settlement
6 of claims against the State and others related to the
7 2023 Maui wildfires to compensate those who have
8 suffered real and personal property damage, personal
9 injury, wrongful death, emotional distress and
10 inconvenience, or economic loss in the 2023 Maui
11 wildfires is in the public interest;
12 (4) Settling claims related to the 2023 Maui wildfires is
13 an efficient mechanism to address the urgent and
14 exceptional situation caused by the 2023 Maui
15 wildfires, and will offer a unique ability to help
16 those in need;
17 (5) The complexity and challenges of tort litigation,
18 including the length of time needed to resolve
19 lawsuits, make it prudent to provide an alternative to
20 litigation through the State's contribution to the
21 Maui wildfires settlement agreements that will allow

C.D. 1
1 for the early compromise and settlement of claims and
2 expedite the compensation process for those impacted
3 by the 2023 Maui wildfires;
4 (6) It is in the public interest to encourage swift and
5 fair resolution to claims arising from the 2023 Maui
6 wildfires, thus alleviating the burden on the judicial
7 system and fostering community support, unity, and
8 recovery in the aftermath of the 2023 Maui wildfires;
9 and
10 (7) Individuals receiving compensation pursuant to the
11 Maui wildfires settlement agreements shall release the
12 State and other parties that contribute to the Maui
13 wildfires settlement agreements from further liability
14 and shall voluntarily waive their rights to pursue
15 damages through litigation for real and personal
16 property damage, personal injury, wrongful death,
17 emotional distress and inconvenience, and economic
18 loss, contributing to a more efficient resolution
19 process.
20 The legislature further finds that the Maui wildfires
21 settlement agreements reached in November 2024 aim to resolve
2025-3316 HBIOOI CDl HMSO
Page 4 H.B. NO. ™-
C.D. 1
1 lawsuits related to the 2023 Maui wildfires. Under the proposed
2 terms of the Maui wildfires settlement agreements, the seven
3 defendants - the State of Hawaii, county of Maui, Hawaiian
4 Electric, Kamehameha Schools, Charter Communications/Spectrum,
5 Hawaiian Telcom, and West Maui Land Company - collectively
6 agreed to pay $4,037,000,000 to provide compensation to the
7 approximately two thousand two hundred affected parties who
8 filed lawsuits. The State's contribution is approximately
9 $807,500,000, to be paid over four years. The State's
10 settlement amount is in addition to the State's $65,000,000
11 contribution to the One Ohana Fund for wildfire assistance.
12 The allocation of funds and the determination of individual
13 compensation amounts have yet to be finalized.
14 Further, the Hawaii supreme court recently decided in In re
15 Petition for the Coordination of Maui Fire Cases that property
16 and casualty insurance companies may only recover payments made
17 to policyholders for 2023 Maui wildfire damages using a
18 statutory lien. This limitation on the subrogation remedies
19 available to insurers allows the settlement to proceed as
20 planned.

C.D. 1
1 Consequently, the legislature finds that authorizing the
2 expenditure of public moneys as the State's payment to the
3 compromise and settlement of claims arising from the 2023 Maui
4 wildfires will provide a means of compensation to any individual
5 or personal representative of a deceased individual who suffered
6 real and personal property damage, personal injury, wrongful
7 death, emotional distress and inconvenience, or economic loss as
8 a result of the 2023 Maui wildfires, and will offer a timely and
9 compassionate resolution to those affected by the Maui wildfires
10 while relieving the burden on the judicial system and
11 contributing to the rebuilding of lives and community. The
12 State's contribution to the settlement of claims will be
13 distributed pursuant to the Maui wildfires settlement
14 agreements.
15 Further, the legislature finds that the Maui wildfires
16 settlement trust fund is recognized as a trust fund, where the
17 claimants of the Maui wildfires settlement hold a vested
18 beneficial interest that was established by a legislative
19 appropriation that restricts the use of the trust fund
20 exclusively for settling claims arising from the 2023 Maui
21 wildfires and covering its administrative costs.

7 by adding a new section to part I to be appropriately designated

10 shall be established in the state treasury the Maui wildfires
11 settlement trust fund, which shall be administered by the

19 shall be used for the following purposes:

6 agreements. Upon termination, moneys in the trust fund shall
7 revert back to the State and shall lapse to the general fund;
8 provided that any moneys advanced to the trust fund as a loan
9 shall be repaid without interest.
10 (d) The director of finance may loan moneys to the Maui
11 wildfires settlement trust fund from the general, special, or
12 revolving funds of the State that, in the director of finance's
13 judgment, are in excess of the amounts necessary for the State's
14 requirements and will not impede or hamper the necessary
15 financial operations of the State. The loans shall be without
16 interest. All loans shall be repaid upon demand of the director
17 of finance.
