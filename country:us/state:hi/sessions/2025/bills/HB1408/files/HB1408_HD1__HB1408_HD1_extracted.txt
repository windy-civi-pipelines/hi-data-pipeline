HB1408 HD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1408 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HAWAIIAN HOME LANDS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that article XII, section 1, of the Hawaii State Constitution provides that "[a]nything in this constitution to the contrary notwithstanding, the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, enacted by the Congress, as the same has been or may be amended prior to the admission of the State, is hereby adopted as a law of the State, subject to amendment or repeal by the legislature".  The legislature further finds that article XII, section 2, of the Hawaii State Constitution provides that "[t]he State and its people do hereby accept, as a compact with the United States, or as conditions or trust provisions imposed by the United States, relating to the management and disposition of the Hawaiian home lands, the requirement that section 1 hereof be included in this constitution, in whole or in part, it being intended that the Act or acts of the Congress pertaining thereto shall be definitive of the extent and nature of such compact, conditions or trust provisions, as the case may be". Finally, article XII, section 2, of the Hawaii State Constitution provides that "[t]he State and its people do further agree and declare that the spirit of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act looking to the continuance of the Hawaiian homes projects for the further rehabilitation of the Hawaiian race shall be faithfully carried out".

The purpose of this Act is to further the provisions in article XII, section 2, of the Hawaii State Constitution supporting the development of residential homestead lots and housing units by allowing the department of Hawaiian home lands to utilize the dwelling unit revolving fund collateral when acting as an eligible borrower for a loan guaranteed under section 184A of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, as amended, and to appropriate the necessary funds for this purpose.
