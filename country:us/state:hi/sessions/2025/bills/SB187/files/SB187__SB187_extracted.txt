BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that on August 28, 1971, the Ewa Beach public and school library opened on the James Campbell high school campus with the dual purpose of serving as both a school library and a community library.  The Ewa Beach public and school library is administratively established within the Hawaii public library system and the hours are established by the state librarian, subject to state library funding.
