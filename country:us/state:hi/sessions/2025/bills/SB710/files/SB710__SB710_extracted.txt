BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that in 2022, the auditor was requested to conduct a performance audit of the child welfare services branch of the department of human services (department), pursuant to senate concurrent resolution 102 S.D. 1 H.D. 1.  In April 2024, the auditor published report no. 24‑05, finding that the department's process to license child-specific homes did not comply with legal requirements and that the department failed to monitor or evaluate the performance of its contractor hired to complete documentation necessary for licensing, ultimately putting children at risk. The legislature also finds that, pursuant to Act 86, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023, the malama ohana working group was established to improve the child welfare system by seeking, designing, and recommending transformative changes to the State's existing child welfare system.  The malama ohana working group published its final report with various recommendations on December 9, 2024. The legislature further finds that the senate committee on health and human services conducted an informational briefing on November 21, 2024, to address the April 2024 state audit of child welfare services and concerns regarding the child welfare system in Hawaii.  The informational briefing agenda included highlights from the audit, recommendations from the malama ohana working group, a review of the 2016 East Hawaii pilot program, and a status update from the department of human services regarding efforts to increase recruitment of foster families and social workers. The legislature notes that the informational briefing highlighted persistent shortcomings in Hawaii's child welfare system and recognizes that there is an urgent need for systemic change. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to convene a child welfare task force to develop strategies and policy changes to transform and improve the State's child welfare system. SECTION 2. (a)  There is established within the department of human services, for administrative purposes only, a child welfare task force to develop strategies and policy changes to transform and improve the State's child welfare system, including consideration of the recommendations of the malama ohana working group, pursuant to Act 86, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023.
