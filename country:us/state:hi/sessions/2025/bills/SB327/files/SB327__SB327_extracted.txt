Section 1:
SB327 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 327 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT Relating to Internships. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1. The legislature finds that expanding state‑funded internships to include private-sector positions will benefit the State by promoting economic growth, fostering public-private collaborations, and supporting job creation.  State-funded private-sector internships will also create additional opportunities for interns to gain practical work experience and prepare for their future careers. The legislature recognizes that article VII, section 4, of the Hawaii State Constitution requires the legislature to appropriate moneys "for a public purpose".  The courts have found that what constitutes a public purpose "is generally a question for the legislature to decide" and that the legislature should be given "wide discretion" in this matter (State ex. rel. Amemiya v. Anderson, 56 Haw. 566, 574 (1976)). Therefore, the legislature finds that permitting state‑funded private‑sector internships is in the best interest of the State and serves the public purpose of supporting health, safety, and welfare. Accordingly, the purpose of this part is to authorize and appropriate moneys for the department of labor and industrial relations to administer an on-the-job training work experience program for eligible interns. SECTION 2. Chapter 394, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§394-     On-the-job training work experience program.  (a)  The department of labor and industrial relations may enter into contracts with employers or registered apprenticeship program sponsors in the private sector to provide on-the-job training to eligible interns.  The department may provide to the employers or sponsors up to $20.00 per hour in reimbursements for wages only, but not for fringe benefits or other costs, for the extraordinary costs of training and supervising an intern.  The employers or sponsors shall not be required to provide documentation of these extraordinary costs. (b) Eligible employers or sponsors shall demonstrate compliance with Hawaii compliance express or any successor program established to facilitate compliance with section 103D‑310(c). (c) Contracts under this section shall be limited to a period of twelve weeks, with an extension of up to twelve additional weeks if approved by the director of labor and industrial relations; provided that the term of training shall be sufficient to allow the participant to become proficient in the occupation for which training is provided. In determining the appropriate length of the contract, the director shall consider the: (1)  Occupation's skill requirements; (2)  Intern's existing academic and occupational skill levels; and (3)  Intern's prior work experience. (d) The employer or sponsor shall comply with state and federal minimum wage rates and overtime requirements pursuant to chapter 387 and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended. (e) The department of labor and industrial relations shall adopt systems and rules pursuant to chapter 91, as necessary, to develop and implement the program, including systems and rules allowing the department to: (1)  Ensure that participating interns are eligible pursuant to subsection (f) and participating employers or sponsors are eligible pursuant to subsection (g); (2)  Ensure that interns are referred by the department to employers or sponsors and not directly by the employers or sponsors; (3)  Reimburse employers or sponsors up to $20.00 per hour for wages only for the extraordinary costs of providing intern training and supervision; (4)  Develop a training plan for each intern in collaboration with the intern and employer or sponsor; (5)  Monitor each intern's progress in the program to ensure that training plan objectives are being met; (6)  Consult with interns and on-site supervisors to address any problems affecting the training plan; (7)  Terminate an internship, if necessary, due to problems at the worksite caused by either the intern or the employer or sponsor; and (8)  Limit employer or sponsor participation to no more than five interns at one time, as tracked by the federal employer identification number of the employer or sponsor.
