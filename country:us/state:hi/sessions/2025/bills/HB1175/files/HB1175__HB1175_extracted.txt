HB1175 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1175 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE PROCEDURE FOR TAX APPEALS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that section 232-19, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is no longer consistent with the appeal procedures adopted by the judiciary and must be amended to restore consistency. The legislature further finds that Alford v. City and County of Honolulu, 109 Hawaiʻi 14, 122 P.3d 809 (2005), created an issue regarding appellate jurisdiction over a dispositive order that is later merged into a final judgment if a notice of appeal is filed within thirty days of the judgment but not within thirty days of the earlier order. The purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Conform the statutory provisions for tax appeals with the procedures adopted by the judiciary; and (2)  Clarify that an appeal may be taken if a notice of appeal is filed within thirty days of the judgment or within thirty days of the earlier order.

All such appeals shall be speedily disposed of and, in the hearing and disposition thereof, shall be given preference over other litigation in the discretion of the court." SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: Taxation; Tax Appeals; Filing; Appeal from Final Judgment Description: Removes language specifying that an appeal from the Tax Appeal Court be filed with the Tax Appeal Court.  Allows an appeal from the Tax Appeal Court to be filed within thirty days of entry of a final judgment.
