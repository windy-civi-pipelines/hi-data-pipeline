HB515 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 515 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to TRANSPORTATION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  Electric bicycles have become widely available for personal transportation and are popular among all ages.  Hawaiis law defines electric bicycles as a low-speed bicycle with an assisted maximum speed of less than twenty miles per hour.  Despite this, riders often make modifications to electric bicycles with an aftermarket delimiter allowing them to reach speeds of over thirty miles per hour, which is nearly ten times faster than the average walking speed of a person. While electric bicycles are more convenient and affordable than automobiles, they can pose a serious safety hazard when ridden on sidewalks and public roadways, especially by youth. Currently, persons under the age of fifteen cannot operate an electric bicycle by law; yet most e-bikes are ridden by adolescents between the ages of twelve and seventeen.  From 2022 to 2023, the volume of children arriving at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children with injuries from e-bikes doubled, while in the second quarter of 2024, e-bikes were the most common cause of injury among children treated at their trauma center. The legislature finds in the wake of a recent surge in ridership accidents and the increasing use among youth, it is critical to address this issue with stricter enforcement.  Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Categorize electric bicycles into three classes based on speed and operation; (2)  Establish more stringent regulations for electric bicycles; (3)  Require electric bicycle manufacturers and distributors to apply a label to each electric bicycle specifying the classification number, top assisted speed, and motor wattage of the electric bicycle; (4)  Require Class 3 electric bicycle operators to comply with licensure and insurance requirements similar to that of moped and motorcycle drivers. SECTION 2.  Chapter 291C-143.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "[[]§291C-143.5[]]  [Low-speed electric] Electric bicycles[; operator age].  (a)  This section shall apply whenever an electric bicycle is operated upon any highway, street, roadway, or other designated public area set aside for the use of electric bicycles. (b)  No person under the age of fifteen shall operate [a low-speed] an electric bicycle [as defined under title 15 United States Code section 2085.] on a highway, street, roadway, or any other public property in the State. (c)  No person shall operate an electric bicycle that is carrying any other person, nor shall any person other than the operator ride upon an electric bicycle. (d)  No person operating an electric bicycle shall carry any package, bundle, or article which prevents the use of both hands in the control and operation of the bicycle. A person operating an electric bicycle shall keep at least one hand on the handlebars at all times. (e)  No person shall operate an electric bicycle at a speed other than is reasonable and prudent and having regard to the actual and potential hazards and conditions then existing; provided that no person shall operate an electric bicycle at a speed greater than twenty-eight miles per hour. (f)  Any person who operates an electric bicycle recklessly in disregard of the safety of persons or property shall be assessed penalties as set forth in section 291C-161(b). (g)  Any electric bicycle shall meet the specifications of and requirements for lamps and other equipment on bicycles as set out in section 291C-147; provided that in lieu of the requirement of section 291C-147(b), every electric bicycle shall be equipped with a lighted lamp that is visible from the rear. (h)  No person shall operate an electric bicycle unless the person wears a safety helmet securely fastened with a chin strap.  The safety helmet shall meet the specifications of and requirements for a bicycle helmet as set out in section 291C-150. (i)  No electric bicycle shall be operated on a sidewalk, sidewalk area, pedestrian overpass, or pedestrian underpass, except as may be authorized by ordinances or rules adopted by the county. (j)  No person shall tamper with or modify an electric bicycle so as to change the motor-powered speed capability or engagement of an electric bicycle, or the label indicating the classification number. (k)  No person shall operate an electric bicycle after January 1, 2029 unless the electric bicycle has affixed thereto in a prominent location, a manufacturer's label providing the classification number, top assisted speed, and motor wattage of the electric bicycle. (l) The counties by ordinance may impose restrictions and conditions for the regulation and safe operation of electric bicycles with regard to, but not limited to, the following: (1)  Operations in or upon roadways, bikeways, bicycle paths, and sidewalks; (2)  Restrictions on maximum speed; (3)  Safety considerations; and (4)  Hours of operation.
