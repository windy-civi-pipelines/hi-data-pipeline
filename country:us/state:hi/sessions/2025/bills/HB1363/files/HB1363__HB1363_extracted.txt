Section 1:
HB1363 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1363 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to liquor. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that under existing law, only an authorized solicitor or a representative of a manufacturer or wholesale dealer of liquor is authorized to represent their products in other counties of the State. This puts other licensees, particularly small local producers like independent wineries, brewpubs, and small craft producer pubs, at a disadvantage, as these smaller licensees are only allowed to promote within the county where their liquor license has been issued.  The legislature believes that those holding a winery, brewpub, or small craft producer pub license should be provided with the same opportunity to grow their brands within the State as is already afforded to those with a manufacturer or wholesale dealer license. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to allow persons to apply for a permit to act as solicitors or representatives of wineries, brewpubs, and small craft producer pubs in any county of the State. SECTION 2.  Section 281-39, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (c) to read as follows: "(c)  Any person desiring to act as the authorized solicitor or representative of a manufacturer [or], wholesale dealer, winery, brewpub, or small craft producer pub in any county shall make application to the commission of [such] the county in which the person proposes to act for a permit [to act as such]." SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: Liquor; Wineries; Brewpubs; Small Craft Producer Pubs; Authorized Solicitors; Representatives; Permits; Place of Business Description: Authorizes persons to apply for a permit to act as solicitors or representatives of licensed wineries, brewpubs, and small craft producer pubs in any county of the State.
