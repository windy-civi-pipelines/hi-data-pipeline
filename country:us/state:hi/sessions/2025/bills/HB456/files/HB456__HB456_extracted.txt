HB456 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 456 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to raw milk. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "Mark Nakashima Act". SECTION 2.  The legislature finds that many people would like to consume raw, unpasteurized milk and raw milk products based on the products' health benefits and taste. Some studies have shown that raw milk helps reduce allergies, boost immunity, hydrate skin, and address nutritional deficiencies.  Raw milk has a unique flavor that may be destroyed by the double pasteurization process generally required for commercial milk sales.  Raw milk also contains bacteria that are essential flavor components of some cheeses. The legislature further finds that raw milk can be produced safely and that its sale is permitted in many other states. Hawaii is in the small minority of four states that still do not allow any form of raw milk distribution.  The legislature believes Hawaii's consumers and pets also deserve this freedom of choice and should be permitted to purchase raw milk and raw milk products directly from producers, while also maintaining high standards of safety and quality. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to allow milk producers to sell raw milk products directly to consumers, subject to certain conditions. SECTION 3.  Chapter 157, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part    .  RAW MILK AND ASSOCIATED PRODUCTS §157-A  Definitions.  For the purposes of this part: "Distribute" means to transfer an item or offer to transfer an item to another person, either free of charge or by sale or exchange.

"Raw milk dairy" means an operation owned or operated by a raw milk producer in which no more than ten milk-bearing animals are maintained to actively produce milk at any one time. "Raw milk dairy product" means a product, other than a raw milk product, that is manufactured using milk or a milk product as the primary ingredient and that includes any quantity of raw milk. "Raw milk producer" means a milk producer that owns or operates a raw milk dairy. "Raw milk product" means a product that is manufactured using milk as its exclusive ingredient and that includes any quantity of raw milk. §157-B Raw milk; direct distribution permitted.  (a)  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, beginning July 1, 2026, a raw milk producer may distribute raw milk, raw milk products, and raw milk dairy products directly to consumers for human consumption, subject to compliance with this part and rules adopted by the board pursuant to subsection (b); provided that: (1)  The raw milk dairy from which the raw milk, raw milk product, or raw milk dairy product originated shall own or house no more than ten milk-bearing animals; (2)  The raw milk shall be produced exclusively from the milk‑bearing animals maintained at the raw milk dairy; (3)  The raw milk shall be produced at the raw milk dairy in a manner that protects the health and safety of persons consuming the raw milk, pursuant to rules adopted by the board; (4)  Every twelve months, a licensed veterinarian shall examine each milk-bearing animal maintained at the raw milk producer's raw milk dairy to determine the milk-bearing animal's health status.  The examination shall include a blood test to detect the presence of any common diseases afflicting milk-bearing animals; (5)  Each month, the raw milk producer shall test each milk-bearing animal maintained at the raw milk producer's raw milk dairy to determine the milk-bearing animal's coliform count and standard plate count; provided that the raw milk producer shall post the summary of the test at the raw milk dairy's distribution point for the raw milk; (6)  No raw milk producer shall: (A)  Process, market, or distribute raw milk if the raw milk exceeds the acceptable bacteria count limit; or (B)  Manufacture, market, or distribute a raw milk product or raw milk dairy product if the raw milk used as an ingredient exceeds the acceptable bacteria count limit.
