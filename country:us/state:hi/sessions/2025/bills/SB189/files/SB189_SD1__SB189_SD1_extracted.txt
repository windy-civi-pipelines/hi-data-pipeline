Section 1:
SB189 SD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 189 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO BREAST CANCER SCREENING. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The purpose of this Act is to reduce incidences of breast cancer and breast cancer-related deaths by mandating insurance coverage for early breast cancer screenings.  The legislature notes that the auditor assessed the social and financial impacts of a virtually identical measure (S.B. No. 827, S.D. 2 (2021)) in Report No. 23-03, Study of Proposed Mandatory Health Insurance Coverage for Early Access Breast Cancer Screening, which was issued in February 2023.  The legislature believes that the auditor's 2023 assessment of the measure's mandate remains valid for purposes of sections 23-51 and 23-52, Hawaii Revised Statutes, this year. SECTION 2.  Section 431:10A-116, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§431:10A-116  Coverage for specific services.  Every person insured under a policy of accident and health or sickness insurance delivered or issued for delivery in this State shall be entitled to the reimbursements and coverages specified below: (1)  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, whenever a policy, contract, plan, or agreement provides for reimbursement for any visual or optometric service that is within the lawful scope of practice of a duly licensed optometrist, the person entitled to benefits or the person performing the [services] service shall be entitled to reimbursement whether the service is performed by a licensed physician or by a licensed optometrist.

The services provided in this paragraph are subject to any coinsurance provisions that may be in force in these policies, contracts, plans, or agreements; provided that the insured's dollar limits, deductibles, and copayments for services shall be on terms at least as favorable to the insured as those applicable to other radiological examinations. For the [purpose] purposes of this paragraph, [the term] "low-dose mammography" means the x-ray examination of the breast using equipment dedicated specifically for mammography, including [but not limited to] the x-ray tube, filter, compression device, screens, films, and cassettes, with an average radiation exposure delivery of less than one rad mid‑breast, with two views for each breast.  An insurer may provide the services required by this paragraph through contracts with providers; provided that the contract is determined to be a cost-effective means of delivering the services without sacrifice of quality and meets the approval of the director of health; [and] (5)  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, each policy, contract, plan, or agreement issued on or before January 1, 2026, except for policies that only provide coverage for specific diseases or other limited benefit coverage, but including policies issued by companies subject to chapter 431, article 10A, part II and chapter 432, article 1, shall provide, for a patient of any age, any supplemental imaging deemed medically necessary by the patient's primary care provider, including breast magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, or digital breast tomosynthesis.
