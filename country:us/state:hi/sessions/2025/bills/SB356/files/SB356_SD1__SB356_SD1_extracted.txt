BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  Chapter 706, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part III to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§706-    Victim restitution; financial support for minor children of victims of persons operating a vehicle under the influence.  (1) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, if a defendant is convicted of violating section 291E-61 or 707‑702.5(1)(a) and the violation caused the disability or death of a parent or legal guardian of a minor child, the sentencing court shall order the defendant to make restitution in the form of financial support to each child of the victim until the child reaches: (a)  Eighteen years of age; or (b)  Nineteen years of age if the child is still enrolled in high school. (2)  In determining an amount that is reasonable and necessary for the financial support of the victim's child, the court shall consider all relevant factors, including the: (a)  Financial needs and resources of the child; (b)  Financial resources and needs of the disabled parent, surviving parent, or legal guardian of the child, or if applicable, the financial resources of the State if the child is in the custody of the department of children's services; (c)  Standard of living to which the child is accustomed; (d)  Physical and emotional condition of the child and the child's educational needs; (e)  Child's physical and legal custody arrangements; and (f)  Reasonable child care expenses of the disabled parent, surviving parent, or legal guardian. (3)  The court shall order that payments made to financially support the child be made first to the disabled parent, surviving parent, or legal guardian.  The clerk of the court shall be made trustee for remittance to the child as an alternative to a disabled parent, surviving parent, or legal guardian, if deemed necessary.  If payments are made to the clerk, the clerk shall: (a)  Deposit all payments no later than the next working day after receipt; and (b)  Remit the payments to the disabled parent, surviving parent, or legal guardian within three working days of receipt by the clerk. (4) If a defendant who is ordered to make restitution in the form of financial support for the child under this section is incarcerated and unable to make the required restitution, the defendant shall have up to one year after the release from incarceration to begin payment, including entering into a payment plan to address any arrearage. (5) If a defendant's payments to financially support the child are set to terminate but the defendant's obligation is not paid in full, the payments to financially support the child shall continue until the entire arrearage is paid. (6) If the disabled parent, surviving parent, or legal guardian of the child brings a civil action against the defendant before the sentencing court orders restitution to financially support the child and the disabled parent, surviving parent, or legal guardian obtains a judgment and full satisfaction of damages in the civil suit, restitution shall not be ordered under this section. (7) If the court orders the defendant to make restitution to financially support the child under this section and the disabled parent, surviving parent, or legal guardian subsequently brings a civil action and obtains a judgment, the restitution order shall be offset by the amount of the judgment awarded and paid by the defendant or the defendant's insurance for lost wages. For the purposes of this section, "disabled": (1)  Means a legal disability as is measured by functional inabilities; and (2)  Includes inabilities caused by psychological, psychiatric, or stress-related trauma, and refers to any person who is unable to make informed decisions with respect to their physical health and safety or the physical health and safety of a minor child, including health care, food, shelter, clothing, or personal hygiene."
