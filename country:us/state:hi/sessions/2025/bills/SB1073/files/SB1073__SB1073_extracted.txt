Section 1:
SB1073 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1073 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to charter schools. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that charter schools are not able to secure long-term leases, make necessary large purchases, and create long-term strategic plans for campuses with a charter contract due to the short length of the term authorized in existing law.  The legislature further finds that lengthening the charter contract renewal period to ten years will allow charter schools to effectively secure leases, make significant campus purchases, and engage in long-term strategic planning, which will foster the growth and development of charter schools in the State. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to authorize the renewal of a charter contract to a ten-year term. SECTION 2.  Section 302D-18, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows: "(a) A charter contract may be renewed for successive [five-year] ten-year terms of duration, although an authorizer may vary the terms based on performance, demonstrated capacities, and particular circumstances of each charter school.  An authorizer may grant a renewal of a charter contract with specific conditions for necessary improvements to a charter school." SECTION 3. Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 4. This Act shall take effect upon its approval. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: Charter Schools; Contract Renewals; Terms Description: Authorizes charter school contracts to be renewed for successive ten-year terms of duration.
