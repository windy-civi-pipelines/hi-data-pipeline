THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE. 2025
STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 2
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that addressing mental
2 health needs early in life is imperative for better health and
3 well-being in adulthood. Adverse childhood experiences, which
4 are various forms of trauma during a child's development, are
5 linked to a greater likelihood of lifelong risky behaviors that
6 can lead to chronic diseases and poor mental health, including
7 depression, anxiety, and suicidality.
8 The importance of children and adolescent mental health was
9 emphasized during the COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly
10 impacted the social, emotional, and mental well-being of youth
11 globally. Hawaii children and adolescents, like those in other
12 states in the nation, were more likely to have depression and
13 anxiety after the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.
14 The child and adolescent mental health division of the
15 department of health is the State's medicaid provider of
16 intensive mental health services for youth. Services provided
2025-2967 SB1442 HD2 HMSO

S.B. NO. 2^^
1 by the division may be described as a multi-tiered and
2 multi-agency system of care.
3 The child and adolescent mental health division receives
4 referrals from, and provides mental health services in
5 coordination and collaboration with, other state government
6 agencies, as appropriate. For example, the division may receive
7 a client who is housed in a detention home, has been abused, and
8 has dropped out of school. The division will provide the child
9 with treatment and services in coordination with other state
10 agencies, including the judiciary, child welfare services, and
11 department of education, that may be involved given the child's
12 circumstances. To minimize disruptions in the daily lives of
13 the clients and their families, the division provides its
14 clients with community-based services and supports by
15 contracting with mental health professionals who practice near
16 or in the communities where eligible children and adolescents
17 live.
18 The purpose of this Act is to clarify and update the
19 responsibilities of the child and adolescent mental health
20 division of the department of health to reflect the current
