STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 2
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO PHARMACISTS,
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII;
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that there is currently a
2 statewide physician shortage. According to the federal Health
3 Resources and Services Administration, each county in the State
4 contains a region that is a medically underserved area, as
5 defined by the Public Health Service Act of 1944, Public Law
6 78-410.
7 The legislature further finds that pharmacists can help
8 bridge the gaps created by the physician shortage. A
9 pharmacist's skill set includes educating patients on how and
10 when to check blood sugar, ways to avoid and manage
11 hypoglycemia, how to take their medications correctly to avoid
12 adverse effects, and various medication utilization techniques.
13 Additionally, patients are significantly less likely to be
14 readmitted to the hospital when pharmacists provide clinical
15 services after a hospital discharge.
16 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to require private
17 and public health plans issued in the State to recognize
