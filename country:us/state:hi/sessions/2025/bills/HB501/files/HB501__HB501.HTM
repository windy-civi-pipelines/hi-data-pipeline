Section 1:
HB501 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 501 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to the department of law enforcement. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that, in a 2019 report, the United States Department of Agriculture found that agricultural theft and vandalism, and the expense of security measures to prevent these crimes in the State, cost farmers roughly $14,400,000.  In 2020, the Hawaii department of agriculture reported sixty-six cases of felony agricultural theft, thirty cases of trespassing, and forty-eight other related offenses in Hawaii county. In 2024, a rancher was killed in a confrontation on Oahu, allegedly stemming from trespassing.  This incident highlights the heightened opportunity for violent crimes to occur when weapons are present during disputes on farms and ranches. The legislature further finds that agricultural crime is likely underreported throughout the State.  The rural locations of ranches and farms can make it challenging for law enforcement agencies to timely respond to reports, especially agencies that may be understaffed or do not prioritize agricultural crimes compared to other violent and property crimes.  Consequently, the ability to prevent, investigate, and prosecute agricultural crimes statewide must be prioritized to ensure community safety on all islands. The legislature recognizes that there is a recruitment challenge within the department of law enforcement, including the ability to recruit new law enforcement officers to serve in specific and identified areas of law enforcement.  One solution to increase the pool of law enforcement candidates is to authorize individuals who have an aloha (love) or kuleana (responsibility) with the agricultural community to help with the deterrence, investigation, and enforcement of laws and rules directly relating to agricultural crimes and make a difference in the agricultural community in the State, including volunteers. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Establish an agricultural enforcement program within the department of law enforcement; (2)  Establish the agricultural enforcement special fund; and (3)  Appropriate funds for and establish positions within the agricultural enforcement program. SECTION 2. Chapter 353C, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding two new sections to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§353C-A  Agricultural enforcement program.  (a) There is established within the department an agricultural enforcement program.  The department shall employ or appoint, and remove, the following persons, subject to chapter 76 and section 78-1: (1)  An assistant chief, who shall be the administrator of the agricultural enforcement program and shall have charge, direction, and control, subject to the direction of control of the director, of all matters relating to the enforcement of the offense of theft of an agricultural product or commodity as defined in section 708-835.55, and any other matters as determined by the director.  The assistant chief shall be an administrator experienced in addressing agricultural theft; and (2)  Personnel, state law enforcement officers, and investigators, including but not limited to state law enforcement officers serving on a voluntary basis without pay. (b) In addition to all police powers and duties, state law enforcement officers in the agricultural enforcement program shall: (1)  Focus on offenses under sections 708-830.5, 708-831, 708-832, and 708-833 that involve the theft of an agricultural product or commodity; (2)  Gather evidence, conduct investigations, and conduct field observations, as required or assigned; (3)  Cooperate with any enforcement authorities of the federal, state, or county government in the development of programs and mutual aid agreements for agricultural activities within the State; and (4)  Carry out other duties and responsibilities as determined by the director.
