SB1131 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1131 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO TAXATION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the housing crisis in the State continues to intensify, exacerbated by the increasing concentration of residential property ownership among large investment entities, such as hedge funds and real estate investment trusts.  These entities often acquire substantial numbers of single-family residences, limiting opportunities for local families to purchase homes, driving up housing prices, and destabilizing communities. The legislature further finds that similar concerns have been raised at the federal level, where legislative proposals seek to address the impact of these entities on our critical housing supply.  While these federal efforts are necessary, state level action is also essential to address the State's unique housing challenges, including its limited land availability and high cost of living. Accordingly, to reduce speculative practices that artificially inflate housing costs and displace local families, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Discourage excessive property holdings by imposing excise taxes on hedge funds and other large investment entities that own or acquire single-family residences in excess of specified thresholds; (2)  Promote affordable home ownership by establishing a housing down payment trust fund to provide grants for down payment assistance to State residents, ensuring that revenues generated from this Act directly benefit local families seeking to enter the housing market; and (3)  Support equitable housing opportunities by incentivizing the sale of single-family residences to local families rather than to offshore corporations or investment entities with extensive property portfolios. This Act is a necessary step to protect the State's housing market from predatory practices, ensure homes remain accessible to local families, and build a more stable and equitable housing ecosystem for the State's residents. SECTION 2. The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Chapter EXCESS SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENCE TAX §   -1  Short title.  This chapter may be cited as the End Hedge Fund Control of Hawaii Homes Act.  It is the intent of the legislature to impose an excise tax on certain taxpayers failing to sell excess single-family residences. §   -2  Definitions.  As used in this chapter: "Covered entity" means any: (1)  Partnership; (2)  Corporation; or (3)  Real estate investment trust.
