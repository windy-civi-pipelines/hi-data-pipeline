Section 1:
SB751 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 751 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to marina restoration. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the Lahaina wildfires of 2023 caused devastating damage to the historic district of Lahaina, including properties along the oceanfront of Front street.  This area, renowned for its cultural and historical significance, has long been a hub for maritime activities and tourism.  Restoring the historic marinas along Front street is essential for maintaining Lahaina's historic district designation, revitalizing its economic and cultural vibrancy, and honoring the community's deep connection to its maritime heritage.

(b)  The permissible uses under any lease disposed of under this section shall be limited to the reconstruction, operation, and maintenance of historical marina structures consistent with the maritime and cultural heritage of the area. Permissible uses shall: (1)  Support the preservation of the district designation, if any; (2)  Complement or promote the economic revitalization, cultural preservation, and related recreational and cultural activities of the area; and (3)  Be consistent with community goals, including environmental sustainability and cultural preservation. (c)  Any lease authorized under this section shall: (1)  Not exceed a term of sixty-five years, including any extensions; (2)  Require lessees to restore structures to reflect the pre-disaster historical run order of marinas and buildings in the area; and (3)  Ensure environmental compliance and alignment with community preservation objectives. (d)  Revenues derived from leases under this section shall be deposited into the boating special fund and allocated for the ongoing maintenance and enhancement of the marina and area.
