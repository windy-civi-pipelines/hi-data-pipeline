SR56 SD1 THE SENATE S.R. NO. 56 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII SENATE RESOLUTION requesting the office of wellness and resilience to DEVELOP a report to address the developmental needs of children born during the CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 pandemic. WHEREAS, the COVID-19 pandemic has had profound effects on children born between the years 2018-2025, disrupting their social, emotional, academic, and health development during their most critical early years; and WHEREAS, scientific evidence and expert testimonies indicate that many children in this age group are experiencing developmental delays, including challenges in communication, fine motor skills, emotional regulation, and social interaction; and WHEREAS, early childhood education and support during these formative years are crucial for long-term academic success and overall well-being, yet these children may face compounded challenges as they transition into middle and high school; and WHEREAS, children who were born and raised during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially those from birth to age five, are at heightened risk for academic and developmental setbacks due to the unique circumstances of their upbringing, including reduced social interactions, increased screen time, and disrupted routines; and WHEREAS, families across the State endured significant challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, including heightened fear of contracting the virus, economic instability due to inflation and loss of income, and increased food and housing insecurity; and WHEREAS, caregivers have faced the additional burden of adapting to online education for their children while managing toxic stress within households, which has adversely affected the social and emotional well-being of children from birth to age five, a critical period for early childhood development; and WHEREAS, climate crisis, such as the 2018 Kilauea eruption and 2023 Maui wildfires, have further compounded the trauma for children in affected areas, leading to additional challenges in emotional and psychological well-being, especially for those who were already vulnerable due to the COVID-19 pandemic; and WHEREAS, trauma can have profound negative impacts on students' social, emotional, and behavioral needs; and WHEREAS, disparities in developmental outcomes have been observed, disproportionately affecting children from economically disadvantaged, minority, rural, and remote communities, including Native Hawaiian communities; and WHEREAS, recovery and catch-up interventions for these children are essential to mitigate long-term impacts on their educational and life trajectories; and WHEREAS, educators and others who work with children have also been profoundly impacted by the stressors of the COVID-19 pandemic, facing increased demands, and limited resources, as well as their own experiences of toxic stress, leading to a record number of educators leaving the profession and fewer individuals entering the field; and WHEREAS, the cascading effects of trauma within families, schools, and communities have placed a significant strain on community-based providers responsible for the care and development of children, further challenging their ability to support the social-emotional needs of children and families; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, that the Office of Wellness and Resilience is requested to develop a report to address the developmental needs of children born during the COVID-19 pandemic; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Office of Wellness and Resilience is requested to include the following in its report: (1)  Trauma-informed care research and practices that: (A)  Identify the nature of trauma and the effects of acute or chronic exposure to trauma; (B)  Present interventions and strategies to resist re-traumatization for those impacted by trauma; and (C)  Recommend cultural practices and research-practiced, evidence-based interventions to support children's transitions into middle school, high school, and post-high school life; (2)  An outline of the existing services offered by the Department of Education, Department of Health, Department of Human Services, Office of Hawaiian Affairs, Executive Office on Early Learning, and key non-profits and community groups to address social and emotional learning loss experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic; (3)  A comprehensive analysis of the services available for individuals and families affected by the 2023 Maui wildfires; (4)  Information on existing services to support educators and those who work directly with children and families who may suffer from secondary traumatic stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic and 2023 Maui wildfires; and (5)  Recommendations to strengthen efforts to support frontline workers' self-care plans and provide interventions to promote resiliency and well-being; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Office of Wellness and Resilience is requested to submit its report, including any proposed legislation, to the Legislature by December 31, 2026; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Governor and Director of the Office of Wellness and Resilience.
