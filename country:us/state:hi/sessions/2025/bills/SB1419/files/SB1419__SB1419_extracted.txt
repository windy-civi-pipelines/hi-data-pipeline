Section 1:
SB1419 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1419 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO ACT 253, SESSION LAWS OF HAWAII 2023. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  Act 253, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023, established the neighbor islands blind and visually impaired service pilot program within the department of human services. The goal of Act 253 is to bridge the gaps in services for blind and low vision residents across the State, particularly focusing on those living on the neighbor islands.  The department's efforts to implement the Act were delayed until July 2024 as the department's staff were responding to the needs of staff and residents impacted by the August 2023 Maui wildfires. Despite the delays, the department engaged a consultant, posted a survey, and had several in-person and virtual meetings to gather information from blind and low vision neighbor island residents to discuss potential training and services that the pilot program may offer.  A report to the legislature was submitted in December 2024 detailing the department's efforts, findings, and recommendations that include requests for two additional temporary full-time equivalent positions within the department and appropriations to implement the pilot program. The purposes of this Act are to: (1)  Rename the pilot program to replace the term "visually impaired" with the less stigmatizing term "low vision," and (2)  Clarify the pilot program's implementation timeframes SECTION 2.  Act 253, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023, section 2, is amended as follows: 1.  By amending subsections (a) and (b) to read: "(a)  The department shall establish a neighbor islands blind and [visually impaired] low vision service pilot program to provide training and other services to blind and [visually impaired] low vision individuals residing on the neighbor islands. (b)  The pilot program shall provide peer-to-peer outreach, sight loss adjustment, peer counseling support, and mobility training to program participants, including: (1)  Outreach efforts to identify individual and program needs; (2)  Coordination with existing programs to ensure that existing services are identified and used to the maximum extent possible; (3)  Adjustment services, including individual and group counseling; (4)  Access to and training for use of telecommunications services to receive current news, weather alerts, and other vital public information; (5)  Awareness development and training for the use of technology, including but not limited to computers, smart phones, and other communications devices; (6)  Daily living, self-care, and home management skills; (7)  Orientation and mobility training; (8)  Advocacy training and assistance to secure needed benefits, services, and individual rights; and (9)  Other services, including peer support needed for program participants to sustain independence and social integration. The services provided by the pilot program pursuant to this subsection shall be provided by volunteers, who shall be recruited, assigned, and supervised by the department or an entity contracted by the department to organize and implement the pilot program.  All volunteers shall have the necessary qualifications, be chosen based on experience and training, and use training methods consistent with the structured discovery approach used by the new visions program operated by the Ho`opono services for the blind branch within the department's division of vocational rehabilitation." 2.  By amending subsections (f) to (h) to read: "(f)  The department shall enter into a contract with a nonprofit organization to recruit, train, and supervise volunteer service corps members and oversee the pilot program; provided that existing department personnel may be assigned to fulfill administrative and fiscal responsibilities of the pilot program.  Any contract entered into pursuant to this subsection shall be exempt from chapters 103D and 103F.  Any nonprofit organization contracted under this subsection shall have: (1)  The knowledge, experience, and qualifications necessary to provide peer support services to program participants; (2)  A management team, consisting of officers and directors, of whom a majority are blind or [visually impaired;] low vision; and (3)  Membership chapters or organization subunits located on the neighbor islands that will be served by the pilot program. (g)  The department shall establish a neighbor islands blind and [visually impaired] low vision service pilot program working group composed of neighbor island residents who are blind or [visually impaired] low vision to make recommendations regarding the establishment and implementation of the pilot program.  The department, in collaboration with the working group, shall develop a written implementation plan that includes a pilot program performance period and program budget, and shall submit the plan, including any proposed legislation, to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of [2024.] 2025.  The working group shall be exempt from the requirements of part I of chapter 92, Hawaii Revised Statutes. (h)  The department shall submit a report of its findings and recommendations pertaining to the neighbor islands blind and [visually impaired] low vision service pilot program to the legislature no later than thirty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 2029.  The report shall include: (1)  A record of pilot program activities and accomplishments; (2)  A recommendation on whether to extend the pilot program; and (3)  Any proposed legislation." 3.  By amending subsections (j) and (k) to read: "(j)  The pilot program [shall begin no later than January 1, 2024, and] shall cease to exist on July 30, 2029.
