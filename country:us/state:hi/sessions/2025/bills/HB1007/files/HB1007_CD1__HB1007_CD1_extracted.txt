Section 1:
HB1007 CD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1007 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII S.D. 2 C.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE HAWAII COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Act 184, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022 (Act 184), which established transit‑oriented development infrastructure improvement districts, could be more efficient and effective.  The transit‑oriented development infrastructure improvement districts comprised the land within county-designated transit‑oriented development zones or within a one-half mile radius of a proposed or existing transit station if the county has not designated transit-oriented development zones, as designated by the board.  Act 184 also established the transit‑oriented development infrastructure improvement district boards for each county, under the Hawaii community development authority for administrative purposes.  To date, these boards have not been constituted, due in part to a lack of community volunteers willing to serve. The legislature further finds that the best-proven models of successful, affordable, healthy, and vibrant communities in transit-oriented development areas require sufficient water, sewer, and power infrastructure; affordable housing; safe, comfortable, and convenient pedestrian and multi-modal transit connectivity; meaningful community amenities such as parks, recreational facilities, and event venues; and community programs that provide for community-based economic development, culture, arts, communication, safety, security, and cleanliness. Too often, basic community infrastructure such as sidewalks, safe multi-modal connectivity, public spaces, community-based economic development, and amenities required for successful, livable communities never materialize without a lead agency taking ownership, prioritizing key community elements, and executing projects.  In most cases, basic community infrastructure is not a priority for any department or agency.  Sometimes this results in costly retrofits after people move in, discover gaps in their quality of life, and pay for missing infrastructure needed to enable families to reduce their cost of transportation and living.  In other cases, basic community infrastructure can no longer be implemented because buildout in the area has already occurred, leaving residents stranded with higher costs of living and no recourse. This results in communities having a higher cost of living than necessary and developments that are often sufficient for transient investment units and vacation properties but not best-suited for local families and permanent residents. The legislature also finds that ensuring the inclusion of complete community infrastructure in planning and implementation can replicate four successful strategies commonly used in successful cities to help significantly reduce the cost of housing and cost of living. Primarily, these include aggregating amenities such as parking and green space into public space, removing those costs from each new development.  Secondly, constructing public infrastructure and properties that generate revenue can help to pay for adequate infrastructure and amenities implementation, as well as reduce the cost of maintenance, security, and similar costs for area residents.  Thirdly, using financing mechanisms such as community financing districts can provide more capacity to ensure that complete community infrastructure and amenities are planned for and included.  Fourthly, constructing multiple lower-story concrete or wood buildings on the same footprint of a tower or podium project can achieve the same number of units on a block, but through a much cheaper per-unit cost because lower structures do not require costly vertical engineering and safety and related components. In numerous other cities, these types of equally dense but less expensive affordable housing developments are often built by both the private and public sectors. The legislature further finds that the two highest costs contributing to the cost of living are housing and transportation. By broadening the State's focus to develop affordable communities with fully built community infrastructure and amenities, rather than just affordable housing, the cost of a single unit can often be reduced by as much as $75,000, and the cost of transportation for families living there can be reduced by $15,000 or more per year. Units in many recent housing projects have become prohibitively expensive.  On average, approximately $50,000 is added to the cost of a unit per associated parking stall constructed, and as much as $25,000 per unit is added for associated building amenities.  Numerous cities and jurisdictions have begun constructing separate, aggregated parking stalls and building amenities, lowering the cost of each unit produced by as much as $75,000. The legislature further finds that building infrastructure, such as separate parking garages, allows residents in an area to lease space or use a parking stall as may be needed, rather than having the expense forced upon them through higher mortgage costs.  This is especially important considering that Hawaii's latest generation is driving considerably less than previous generations. Since 2000, the percentage of eighteen- to twenty‑nine-year-olds with a driver's license has decreased nearly forty per cent.  Many individuals desire to live in walkable, bikeable communities without the costly average expense of $10,000 per year for each additional vehicle along with the $50,000 cost of owning a parking stall. Additionally, relieving housing developers of the burden of building excessive amenities and gathering spaces in each building lowers the cost of living in those units.  Aggregating public spaces for open plazas, gathering spaces, parks, and green spaces available to everyone also creates and fosters a better sense of community and opportunities for better mixed-use commercial, retail, and food options at a lower overall cost. The legislature additionally finds that the most successful affordable communities incorporate mixed-use commercial and retail space into public projects, which not only puts daily needs within walking distance of residents, but also provides revenue-generating lease rent and other opportunities that can help pay for community infrastructure, amenities, security, cleanliness, and maintenance, and lower maintenance fees and the cost of living for residents in the area. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to empower the Hawaii community development authority to implement these and other proven strategies to build infrastructure and projects for better, more affordable, more livable communities and provide residents with a higher quality of life.  Secondly, this Act streamlines transit-oriented development infrastructure improvements by recasting provisions of chapter 206E, part X, Hawaii Revised Statutes, relating to transit-oriented development infrastructure improvements, as a program under the Hawaii community development authority. This will enable the Hawaii community development authority to develop community improvement projects in transit-oriented development areas outside its existing designated districts, provided that planning and implementation shall be assisted by a new board of members having expertise with successful strategies commonly employed elsewhere, rather than the existing multiple districts and boards for each county. This Act also provides additional financing tools and flexibility to fill the gaps in Hawaii's community planning and implementation.  This will provide better community improvements and deliver complete communities with lower housing and transportation costs, safer streets, public spaces, parks, and community amenities that provide a better quality of life. The legislature finds that the Hawaii community development authority may begin to employ these new strategies and use these new tools by assisting with the planning, development, and implementation of the proposed park-and-ride transit and community hub adjacent to the Skyline's Waiawa, Pearl Highlands station on Oahu. SECTION 2.  Chapter 206E, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding two new sections to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§206E-     Issuance of bonds for the development of infrastructure.  (a) Notwithstanding section 206E-21 and 206E‑225, the authority, pursuant to and in accordance with this subpart and section 46-80.1(a), may issue bonds for the purpose of financing the development of infrastructure for: (1)  Land owned by the authority or land within a community development district or area established under this chapter or the stadium development district established in section 206E-223; and (2)  Infrastructure projects under section 206E-246. (b)  All bonds issued by the authority for improvements by assessments, and the interest thereon, shall be exempt from all state, county, and municipal taxation, except inheritance, transfer, and estate taxes. §206E- Condemnation of real property.  The authority, upon making a finding that it is necessary to acquire any real property for its immediate or future use for the purposes of this part, may acquire the property by condemnation pursuant to chapter 101.  The property shall not thereafter be taken for any other public use without the consent of the authority.  No award of compensation shall be increased by reason of any increase in the value of real property caused by the designation of the transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement program areas, or the actual or proposed acquisition, use, or disposition of any other real property by the authority." SECTION 3.  Section 206E-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§206E-1  Findings and purpose.  The legislature finds that many areas of the State are substantially undeveloped, blighted, or economically depressed, and are or are potentially in need of renewal, renovation, or improvement to alleviate such conditions as dilapidation, deterioration, age, and other such factors or conditions [which] that make [such] the areas an economic or social liability. The legislature further finds that there exists within the State vast, unmet community development needs.  These include, but are not limited to, a lack of suitable affordable housing; insufficient commercial and industrial facilities for rent; residential areas [which] that do not have facilities necessary for basic liveability, such as parks and open space; [and] areas [which] that are planned for extensive land allocation to one, rather than mixed uses[.]; a lack of infrastructure necessary to facilitate community development; and insufficient culturally appropriate agriculture, education, and natural-resource restoration and management. It is further determined that the lack of planning and coordination in such areas has given rise to these community development needs and that existing laws and public and private mechanisms have either proven incapable or inadequate to facilitate timely redevelopment and renewal[.], or restoration and management, as the case may be. The legislature finds that a new and comprehensive authority for community development must be created to join the strengths of private enterprise, public development, and regulation into a new form capable of long-range planning and implementation of improved community development.  The purpose of this chapter is to establish such a mechanism in the Hawaii community development authority, which is a public entity [which] that shall determine community development programs and projects and cooperate with private enterprise and the various components of federal, state, and county governments in bringing plans and projects to fruition. [For such areas designated as community development districts, the] The legislature believes that the planning and implementation [program] expertise of the Hawaii community development authority will result in communities [which] that serve the highest needs and aspirations of Hawaii's people. The legislature finds that the creation of the Hawaii community development authority, the establishment of community development districts[, and] and program areas, the issuance of bonds pursuant to this chapter to finance public facilities, and the ability of the Hawaii community development authority to cooperate with or assist public and private sector entities to engage in projects that improve the State, serve the public interest and are matters of statewide concern. The legislature also finds that there are many areas of the State, outside of the Hawaii community development authority's community development districts, where this comprehensive planning, and redevelopment agency should use its powers to facilitate timely redevelopment, renewal, community building, and economic development." SECTION 4.  Section 206E-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows: "(b)  The authority shall consist of the director of finance or the director's designee; the director of transportation or the director's designee; the director of business, economic development, and tourism or the director's designee; the chairperson of the board of land and natural resources; the director of planning or planning and permitting of each county in which a community development district is located or the director's designee; a cultural specialist; an at-large member nominated by the president of the senate; an at‑large member nominated by the speaker of the house of representatives; two representatives of the Heeia community development district, comprising one resident of that district or the Koolaupoko district, which consists of sections 1 through 9 of zone 4 of the first tax map key division, and one owner of a small business or one officer or director of a nonprofit organization in the Heeia community development district or Koolaupoko district; two representatives of the Kalaeloa community development district, comprising one resident of the Ewa zone (zone 9, sections 1 through 2) or the Waianae zone (zone 8, sections 1 through 9) of the first tax map key division, and one owner of a small business or one officer or director of a nonprofit organization in the Ewa or Waianae zone; two representatives of the Kakaako community development district, comprising one resident of the district and one owner of a small business or one officer or director of a nonprofit organization in the district; [and] two representatives of the Pulehunui community development district, consisting of one resident of the island of Maui, and one owner of a small business or one officer or director of a nonprofit organization on the island of Maui[.]; and, for the purposes of part X of this chapter only, two experts on transit-oriented development, to be appointed one each by the president of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives; and the following ex officio, nonvoting members:  the chairpersons of the respective senate and house of representatives standing committees having jurisdiction over transportation, and the chairpersons of the respective senate and house of representatives standing committees having jurisdiction over housing.

SECTION 5.  Chapter 206E, part X, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "[[]Part X.[]]  Transit-oriented DEVELOPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE improvement [district] Program [[]§206E-241[]]  Findings and purpose.  The legislature finds that construction, installation, and improvement of certain infrastructure is necessary and desirable to facilitate renewal and redevelopment of areas designated by the State and the counties for transit-oriented development.  Transit-oriented development is a powerful tool that can ultimately deliver a wide range of social, environmental, and economic benefits.  Transit-oriented development promotes development patterns that support quality of life, preserves the natural environment, provides a range of housing choices for residents, and encourages walking, biking, and use of mass transit.  The State plays an important role in overcoming barriers to transit‑oriented development, including encouraging needed investments in improving regional infrastructure such as roads, sewers, water, power, communication, and storm water management systems.  This part is intended to move transit-oriented development planning efforts forward into infrastructure improvements that benefit the community. The legislature further finds that, currently, no single state agency has the authority to improve infrastructure along a transit corridor in the best interest of the State.  This part will enable the delivery of infrastructure needed to support development on lands within designated transit-oriented development zones. Accordingly, [the purpose of this part is to establish] there shall be established the transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement [districts] program, to be administered by the authority to foster community development by strategically investing in infrastructure improvements. [[]§206E-242[]]  Definitions.  As used in this part: ["Board" means the transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement district board. "District" means the transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement district within each county-designated transit-oriented development zone, or within a one-half mile radius of a proposed or existing transit station if the county has not designated transit-oriented development zones, as determined by the board.] "Fund" means the transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement [district] program special fund established under section 206E-247. "Program" means the transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement [district] program developed by the [board] authority pursuant to section 206E-246. [[]§206E-243[]  District established; boundaries.]  Transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement program areas; established.  [(a) The transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement district is hereby established under the authority.

[]§206E-246[]] Transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement [district] program; assessment; rules.  (a)  The [board] authority shall develop a transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement [district] program to identify infrastructure improvements within each [district.] program area.  In determining the required infrastructure improvements to be undertaken, the [board] authority shall consider the strategic plan prepared and the prioritization of transit‑oriented development projects established by the Hawaii interagency council for transit-oriented development, pursuant to section 226-63(c), and subsequent plans and studies prepared by, or approved by, an appropriate governmental agency to further implement the strategic plan and the transit-oriented development projects therein. (b)  [Whenever the board determines to undertake, or causes to be undertaken, any infrastructure improvement as part of the program,] The authority may assess all beneficiaries of the program a user fee for their fair share of the cost of providing [the] any infrastructure improvement the user may be [assessed against the real property in each district] specially benefiting from [the infrastructure improvement]. The [board] authority shall determine the program areas [of each district] that will benefit from the infrastructure improvement to be undertaken, and if less than the entire [district] transit-oriented development zone benefits, the [board] authority may establish [assessment] user fee areas within the [district.] program area.

[(f)] (e)  Notwithstanding any other provisions to the contrary, the [board] authority may, in its discretion, enter into any agreement with the county in which the [districts] program areas are located to implement all or part of the purposes of this section. [(g)] (f)  All sums collected under this section shall be deposited into the transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement [district] program special fund established under section 206E‑247 and shall be applied solely to: (1)  The payment of the principal and interest on the bonds and the cost of administering, operating, and maintaining the program; (2)  The establishment of reserves; and (3)  Other purposes as may be authorized in the proceedings providing for the issuance of the bonds. If any surplus remains in the fund after the payment of the bonds chargeable against the fund, it shall be credited to and become a part of the fund.

HB1007 CD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1007 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII S.D. 2 C.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE HAWAII COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Act 184, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022 (Act 184), which established transit‑oriented development infrastructure improvement districts, could be more efficient and effective.  The transit‑oriented development infrastructure improvement districts comprised the land within county-designated transit‑oriented development zones or within a one-half mile radius of a proposed or existing transit station if the county has not designated transit-oriented development zones, as designated by the board.  Act 184 also established the transit‑oriented development infrastructure improvement district boards for each county, under the Hawaii community development authority for administrative purposes.  To date, these boards have not been constituted, due in part to a lack of community volunteers willing to serve. The legislature further finds that the best-proven models of successful, affordable, healthy, and vibrant communities in transit-oriented development areas require sufficient water, sewer, and power infrastructure; affordable housing; safe, comfortable, and convenient pedestrian and multi-modal transit connectivity; meaningful community amenities such as parks, recreational facilities, and event venues; and community programs that provide for community-based economic development, culture, arts, communication, safety, security, and cleanliness. Too often, basic community infrastructure such as sidewalks, safe multi-modal connectivity, public spaces, community-based economic development, and amenities required for successful, livable communities never materialize without a lead agency taking ownership, prioritizing key community elements, and executing projects.  In most cases, basic community infrastructure is not a priority for any department or agency.  Sometimes this results in costly retrofits after people move in, discover gaps in their quality of life, and pay for missing infrastructure needed to enable families to reduce their cost of transportation and living.  In other cases, basic community infrastructure can no longer be implemented because buildout in the area has already occurred, leaving residents stranded with higher costs of living and no recourse. This results in communities having a higher cost of living than necessary and developments that are often sufficient for transient investment units and vacation properties but not best-suited for local families and permanent residents. The legislature also finds that ensuring the inclusion of complete community infrastructure in planning and implementation can replicate four successful strategies commonly used in successful cities to help significantly reduce the cost of housing and cost of living. Primarily, these include aggregating amenities such as parking and green space into public space, removing those costs from each new development.  Secondly, constructing public infrastructure and properties that generate revenue can help to pay for adequate infrastructure and amenities implementation, as well as reduce the cost of maintenance, security, and similar costs for area residents.  Thirdly, using financing mechanisms such as community financing districts can provide more capacity to ensure that complete community infrastructure and amenities are planned for and included.  Fourthly, constructing multiple lower-story concrete or wood buildings on the same footprint of a tower or podium project can achieve the same number of units on a block, but through a much cheaper per-unit cost because lower structures do not require costly vertical engineering and safety and related components. In numerous other cities, these types of equally dense but less expensive affordable housing developments are often built by both the private and public sectors. The legislature further finds that the two highest costs contributing to the cost of living are housing and transportation. By broadening the State's focus to develop affordable communities with fully built community infrastructure and amenities, rather than just affordable housing, the cost of a single unit can often be reduced by as much as $75,000, and the cost of transportation for families living there can be reduced by $15,000 or more per year. Units in many recent housing projects have become prohibitively expensive.  On average, approximately $50,000 is added to the cost of a unit per associated parking stall constructed, and as much as $25,000 per unit is added for associated building amenities.  Numerous cities and jurisdictions have begun constructing separate, aggregated parking stalls and building amenities, lowering the cost of each unit produced by as much as $75,000. The legislature further finds that building infrastructure, such as separate parking garages, allows residents in an area to lease space or use a parking stall as may be needed, rather than having the expense forced upon them through higher mortgage costs.  This is especially important considering that Hawaii's latest generation is driving considerably less than previous generations. Since 2000, the percentage of eighteen- to twenty‑nine-year-olds with a driver's license has decreased nearly forty per cent.  Many individuals desire to live in walkable, bikeable communities without the costly average expense of $10,000 per year for each additional vehicle along with the $50,000 cost of owning a parking stall. Additionally, relieving housing developers of the burden of building excessive amenities and gathering spaces in each building lowers the cost of living in those units.  Aggregating public spaces for open plazas, gathering spaces, parks, and green spaces available to everyone also creates and fosters a better sense of community and opportunities for better mixed-use commercial, retail, and food options at a lower overall cost. The legislature additionally finds that the most successful affordable communities incorporate mixed-use commercial and retail space into public projects, which not only puts daily needs within walking distance of residents, but also provides revenue-generating lease rent and other opportunities that can help pay for community infrastructure, amenities, security, cleanliness, and maintenance, and lower maintenance fees and the cost of living for residents in the area. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to empower the Hawaii community development authority to implement these and other proven strategies to build infrastructure and projects for better, more affordable, more livable communities and provide residents with a higher quality of life.  Secondly, this Act streamlines transit-oriented development infrastructure improvements by recasting provisions of chapter 206E, part X, Hawaii Revised Statutes, relating to transit-oriented development infrastructure improvements, as a program under the Hawaii community development authority. This will enable the Hawaii community development authority to develop community improvement projects in transit-oriented development areas outside its existing designated districts, provided that planning and implementation shall be assisted by a new board of members having expertise with successful strategies commonly employed elsewhere, rather than the existing multiple districts and boards for each county. This Act also provides additional financing tools and flexibility to fill the gaps in Hawaii's community planning and implementation.  This will provide better community improvements and deliver complete communities with lower housing and transportation costs, safer streets, public spaces, parks, and community amenities that provide a better quality of life. The legislature finds that the Hawaii community development authority may begin to employ these new strategies and use these new tools by assisting with the planning, development, and implementation of the proposed park-and-ride transit and community hub adjacent to the Skyline's Waiawa, Pearl Highlands station on Oahu. SECTION 2.  Chapter 206E, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding two new sections to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§206E-     Issuance of bonds for the development of infrastructure.  (a) Notwithstanding section 206E-21 and 206E‑225, the authority, pursuant to and in accordance with this subpart and section 46-80.1(a), may issue bonds for the purpose of financing the development of infrastructure for: (1)  Land owned by the authority or land within a community development district or area established under this chapter or the stadium development district established in section 206E-223; and (2)  Infrastructure projects under section 206E-246. (b)  All bonds issued by the authority for improvements by assessments, and the interest thereon, shall be exempt from all state, county, and municipal taxation, except inheritance, transfer, and estate taxes. §206E- Condemnation of real property.  The authority, upon making a finding that it is necessary to acquire any real property for its immediate or future use for the purposes of this part, may acquire the property by condemnation pursuant to chapter 101.  The property shall not thereafter be taken for any other public use without the consent of the authority.  No award of compensation shall be increased by reason of any increase in the value of real property caused by the designation of the transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement program areas, or the actual or proposed acquisition, use, or disposition of any other real property by the authority." SECTION 3.  Section 206E-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§206E-1  Findings and purpose.  The legislature finds that many areas of the State are substantially undeveloped, blighted, or economically depressed, and are or are potentially in need of renewal, renovation, or improvement to alleviate such conditions as dilapidation, deterioration, age, and other such factors or conditions [which] that make [such] the areas an economic or social liability. The legislature further finds that there exists within the State vast, unmet community development needs.  These include, but are not limited to, a lack of suitable affordable housing; insufficient commercial and industrial facilities for rent; residential areas [which] that do not have facilities necessary for basic liveability, such as parks and open space; [and] areas [which] that are planned for extensive land allocation to one, rather than mixed uses[.]; a lack of infrastructure necessary to facilitate community development; and insufficient culturally appropriate agriculture, education, and natural-resource restoration and management. It is further determined that the lack of planning and coordination in such areas has given rise to these community development needs and that existing laws and public and private mechanisms have either proven incapable or inadequate to facilitate timely redevelopment and renewal[.], or restoration and management, as the case may be. The legislature finds that a new and comprehensive authority for community development must be created to join the strengths of private enterprise, public development, and regulation into a new form capable of long-range planning and implementation of improved community development.  The purpose of this chapter is to establish such a mechanism in the Hawaii community development authority, which is a public entity [which] that shall determine community development programs and projects and cooperate with private enterprise and the various components of federal, state, and county governments in bringing plans and projects to fruition. [For such areas designated as community development districts, the] The legislature believes that the planning and implementation [program] expertise of the Hawaii community development authority will result in communities [which] that serve the highest needs and aspirations of Hawaii's people. The legislature finds that the creation of the Hawaii community development authority, the establishment of community development districts[, and] and program areas, the issuance of bonds pursuant to this chapter to finance public facilities, and the ability of the Hawaii community development authority to cooperate with or assist public and private sector entities to engage in projects that improve the State, serve the public interest and are matters of statewide concern. The legislature also finds that there are many areas of the State, outside of the Hawaii community development authority's community development districts, where this comprehensive planning, and redevelopment agency should use its powers to facilitate timely redevelopment, renewal, community building, and economic development." SECTION 4.  Section 206E-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows: "(b)  The authority shall consist of the director of finance or the director's designee; the director of transportation or the director's designee; the director of business, economic development, and tourism or the director's designee; the chairperson of the board of land and natural resources; the director of planning or planning and permitting of each county in which a community development district is located or the director's designee; a cultural specialist; an at-large member nominated by the president of the senate; an at‑large member nominated by the speaker of the house of representatives; two representatives of the Heeia community development district, comprising one resident of that district or the Koolaupoko district, which consists of sections 1 through 9 of zone 4 of the first tax map key division, and one owner of a small business or one officer or director of a nonprofit organization in the Heeia community development district or Koolaupoko district; two representatives of the Kalaeloa community development district, comprising one resident of the Ewa zone (zone 9, sections 1 through 2) or the Waianae zone (zone 8, sections 1 through 9) of the first tax map key division, and one owner of a small business or one officer or director of a nonprofit organization in the Ewa or Waianae zone; two representatives of the Kakaako community development district, comprising one resident of the district and one owner of a small business or one officer or director of a nonprofit organization in the district; [and] two representatives of the Pulehunui community development district, consisting of one resident of the island of Maui, and one owner of a small business or one officer or director of a nonprofit organization on the island of Maui[.]; and, for the purposes of part X of this chapter only, two experts on transit-oriented development, to be appointed one each by the president of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives; and the following ex officio, nonvoting members:  the chairpersons of the respective senate and house of representatives standing committees having jurisdiction over transportation, and the chairpersons of the respective senate and house of representatives standing committees having jurisdiction over housing.

SECTION 5.  Chapter 206E, part X, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "[[]Part X.[]]  Transit-oriented DEVELOPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE improvement [district] Program [[]§206E-241[]]  Findings and purpose.  The legislature finds that construction, installation, and improvement of certain infrastructure is necessary and desirable to facilitate renewal and redevelopment of areas designated by the State and the counties for transit-oriented development.  Transit-oriented development is a powerful tool that can ultimately deliver a wide range of social, environmental, and economic benefits.  Transit-oriented development promotes development patterns that support quality of life, preserves the natural environment, provides a range of housing choices for residents, and encourages walking, biking, and use of mass transit.  The State plays an important role in overcoming barriers to transit‑oriented development, including encouraging needed investments in improving regional infrastructure such as roads, sewers, water, power, communication, and storm water management systems.  This part is intended to move transit-oriented development planning efforts forward into infrastructure improvements that benefit the community. The legislature further finds that, currently, no single state agency has the authority to improve infrastructure along a transit corridor in the best interest of the State.  This part will enable the delivery of infrastructure needed to support development on lands within designated transit-oriented development zones. Accordingly, [the purpose of this part is to establish] there shall be established the transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement [districts] program, to be administered by the authority to foster community development by strategically investing in infrastructure improvements. [[]§206E-242[]]  Definitions.  As used in this part: ["Board" means the transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement district board. "District" means the transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement district within each county-designated transit-oriented development zone, or within a one-half mile radius of a proposed or existing transit station if the county has not designated transit-oriented development zones, as determined by the board.] "Fund" means the transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement [district] program special fund established under section 206E-247. "Program" means the transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement [district] program developed by the [board] authority pursuant to section 206E-246. [[]§206E-243[]  District established; boundaries.]  Transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement program areas; established.  [(a) The transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement district is hereby established under the authority.
