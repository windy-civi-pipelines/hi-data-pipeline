HB1306 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1306 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to housing. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that many kupuna in Hawaii with limited retirement income who may have equity in their home are facing challenges in meeting increased costs related to homeownership; whether it's rising maintenance fees, community assessments, or insurance costs.  Establishing a state-administered home equity conversion mortgage program, similar to the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development program for eligible retirees, could provide housing security and relief for some kupuna.  Such a program would provide a pathway to affordable rental housing for kupuna who have exhausted their home equity, helping to prevent elder displacement and homelessness. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish the kupuna home equity conversion mortgage program. SECTION 2.  Chapter 201H, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new subpart to part III to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "   .  Kupuna Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Program §201H-A  Definitions.  For purposes of this subpart: "First mortgage" means such classes of first liens as are commonly given to secure advances on, or the unpaid purchase price of, real estate or a first or subordinate lien on all stock allocated to a dwelling unit in a residential cooperative housing corporation, together with the credit instruments, if any, secured thereby. "Home equity conversion mortgage" means a first mortgage that provides for future payments to the kupuna homeowner based on accumulated equity and which a housing creditor is authorized to make: (1)  Under any law of the United States or applicable agency regulations thereafter; or (2)  Under any law of the State.

(2)  Will include appropriate safeguards for mortgagors to offset the special risks of the mortgage; and (3)  Have a potential for acceptance in the mortgage market. §201H-C  Eligibility requirements.  To be eligible for insurance under this subpart, a mortgage shall: (1)  Have been originated by a mortgagee approved by the corporation;

(6)  Contain provisions for satisfaction of the obligation satisfactory to the corporation; (7)  Provide that the kupuna homeowner shall not be liable for any difference between the net amount of the remaining indebtedness of the kupuna homeowner under the mortgage and the amount recovered by the mortgagee from: (A)  The net sales proceeds from the dwelling that are subject to the mortgage, based upon the amount of the accumulated equity selected by the mortgagor to be subject to the mortgage, as agreed upon by the mortgagor and mortgagee; or (B)  The insurance benefits paid pursuant to section 201H-H(a)(3); (8)  Contain terms and provisions with respect to insurance, repairs, alterations, payment of taxes, default reserve, delinquency charges, foreclosure proceedings, anticipation of maturity, additional and secondary liens, and other matters as the corporation may prescribe;
