Section 1:
SB213 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 213 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to children. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the State has a paramount interest in protecting all human life.  Any infant born alive, even after an attempted abortion, is a legal person for all purposes under the state and federal constitutions and other state and federal laws.  The legislature also finds that, nationwide, more than six thousand abortions per year reportedly occur after twenty weeks of gestation, a time during which a fetus could be viable.  While most states do not have reporting requirements for failed abortions, in Canada, four hundred and ninety-one cases were reported over a nine-year period where live births after attempted abortions resulted in subsequent neonatal deaths.  Absent proper legal protection, newborns who unexpectedly survive an abortion may be denied life-saving or life-sustaining medical care and left to die. The legislature further finds that protecting an infant whose live birth occurred despite an attempted abortion does not infringe on a woman's right to choose or to obtain an abortion under existing state or federal laws.  It similarly does not interfere with the ability of licensed health care professionals to provide legal abortions. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to protect the life and well-being of all infants who survive abortion attempts in the State by: (1)  Requiring healthcare providers to provide medically appropriate and reasonable life-saving and life‑sustaining medical treatment to all infants born alive; and (2)  Establishing penalties for failing to provide infants born alive with reasonable and appropriate medical care. SECTION 2.  The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Chapter abortion survivors protection act §   -1  Definitions.  For purposes of this chapter, unless the context requires otherwise: "Abortion" means the use or prescription of any instrument, machine, drug, or any other substance or device to intentionally: (1)  End the life of the unborn child of a woman known to be pregnant; or (2)  Terminate the pregnancy of a woman known to be pregnant, with an intention other than to: (A)  Produce a live birth and preserve the life and health of the child born alive after viability; or (B)  Remove a dead unborn child. "Attempt" means, with respect to abortion, conduct that, under the circumstances as the actor believes them to be, constitutes a substantial step in the course of conduct planned to culminate in an abortion. "Born alive" or "live birth" means the complete expulsion or extraction of a viable infant from the infant's mother, regardless of the infant's stage of gestational development, who after expulsion or extraction, whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached, shows evidence of life, including: (1)  Breathing; (2)  A heartbeat; (3)  Umbilical cord pulsations; (4)  Definite movement of voluntary muscles; or (5)  Any other evidence of life according to standard medical practice. "Consent" means the voluntary agreement or acquiescence by a person of age and with the requisite mental capacity who is not under duress or coercion and who has knowledge or understanding of the act or action to which the person agrees or acquiesces. "Healthcare provider" means any person providing aid or assistance to a physician or nurse, or any person authorized to provide healthcare to the mother during an abortion. "Infant" means a human child who has been completely expulsed or extracted from the mother, regardless of the infant's stage of gestational development, until the age of thirty days post-birth. "Nurse" means a person who has been or is currently licensed under chapter 457. "Physician" means: (1)  A physician or surgeon licensed to practice medicine or osteopathy pursuant to chapter 453; or (2)  A person who is not a licensed physician or surgeon but directly performs or attempts to perform an abortion. "Unborn child" means a human fetus, beginning at fertilization, until the point of being born alive. §   -2 Requirements and responsibilities.

(d)  The physician performing an abortion shall take all medically appropriate and reasonable steps to preserve the life and health of an infant born alive.  If an abortion is performed in a hospital but a live birth nevertheless occurs, the physician attending the abortion shall provide immediate medical care to the infant, inform the mother of the live birth, and request transfer of the infant to an on-duty resident or emergency care physician who shall provide medically appropriate and reasonable care and treatment to the infant. (e)  If a physician is unable to perform the duties described in subsection (d) because the physician is assisting the woman on whom the abortion was performed, the attending physician's assistant, a nurse, or other healthcare provider shall assume the duties. (f)  Any infant born alive, including an infant born during an abortion procedure, shall be treated as a legal person under the laws of this State, having all legal rights to medically appropriate and reasonable care and treatment. (g)  If, before the abortion, the mother stated in writing that she does not wish to maintain custody of the infant in the event that the infant is born alive, and this writing is not retracted before the attempted abortion, the infant, if born alive, shall immediately become a ward under the care of the department of human services. (h)  No person shall use, or authorize the use of, any infant born alive for any type of scientific research or medical experimentation, except as necessary to protect the life and health of the infant born alive. (i)  Any physician, nurse, healthcare provider, or employee of a hospital, physician's office, or clinic, who has knowledge of a person's failure to comply with this section shall immediately report the non-compliance to law enforcement. §   -3 Criminal penalties.  (a)  Any physician, nurse, or other healthcare provider who intentionally performs an overt act that kills an infant born alive shall be guilty of the offense of murder in the second degree under section 707-701.5. (b)  Any physician, nurse, or other healthcare provider who recklessly fails to provide medically appropriate and reasonable care and treatment to an infant born alive where the infant dies as a result of that failure shall be guilty of the offense of manslaughter under section 707-702; provided that the other of an infant born alive may not be prosecuted for conspiracy in or as an accomplice to a violation of this subsection. (c)  Any physician, nurse, healthcare provider, or person, including a parent or guardian, who conceals the corpse of an infant with the intent to conceal the fact of the infant's birth or to prevent the determination of whether the infant was born alive or dead shall be guilty of the offense of concealing the corpse of any infant under section 709-901.

SECTION 3.  Section 453-8, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows: "(a)  In addition to any other actions authorized by law, any license to practice medicine and surgery may be revoked, limited, or suspended by the board at any time in a proceeding before the board, or may be denied, for any cause authorized by law, including but not limited to the following: (1)  Procuring, or aiding or abetting in procuring, an abortion that is unlawful under the laws of this State or that would be unlawful under the laws of this State if performed within this State; (2)  Failure to comply with chapter     ; [(2)] (3)  Employing any person to solicit patients for one's self; [(3)] (4)  Engaging in false, fraudulent, or deceptive advertising, including but not limited to: (A)  Making excessive claims of expertise in one or more medical specialty fields; (B)  Assuring a permanent cure for an incurable disease; or (C)  Making any untruthful and improbable statement in advertising one's medical or surgical practice or business; [(4)] (5)  Being habituated to the excessive use of drugs or alcohol; or being addicted to, dependent on, or a habitual user of a narcotic, barbiturate, amphetamine, hallucinogen, or other drug having similar effects; [(5)] (6)  Practicing medicine while the ability to practice is impaired by alcohol, drugs, physical disability, or mental instability; [(6)] (7)  Procuring a license through fraud, misrepresentation, or deceit, or knowingly permitting an unlicensed person to perform activities requiring a license; [(7)] (8)  Professional misconduct, hazardous negligence causing bodily injury to another, or manifest incapacity in the practice of medicine or surgery; [(8)] (9)  Incompetence or multiple instances of negligence, including but not limited to the consistent use of medical service, which is inappropriate or unnecessary; [(9)] (10)  Conduct or practice contrary to recognized standards of ethics of the medical profession as adopted by the Hawaii Medical Association, the American Medical Association, the Hawaii Association of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons, or the American Osteopathic Association; [(10)] (11)  Violation of the conditions or limitations upon which a limited or temporary license is issued; [(11)] (12)  Revocation, suspension, or other disciplinary action by another state or federal agency of a license, certificate, or medical privilege, except when the revocation, suspension, or other disciplinary action was based on the provision or assistance in receipt or provision of medical, surgical, pharmaceutical, counseling, or referral services relating to the human reproductive system, including but not limited to services relating to pregnancy, contraception, or the termination of a pregnancy, so long as the provision or assistance in receipt or provision of the services was in accordance with the laws of this State or would have been in accordance with the laws of this State if it occurred within this State; [(12)] (13)  Conviction, whether by nolo contendere or otherwise, of a penal offense substantially related to the qualifications, functions, or duties of a physician or osteopathic physician, notwithstanding any statutory provision to the contrary, except when the conviction was based on the provision or assistance in receipt or provision of medical, surgical, pharmaceutical, counseling, or referral services relating to the human reproductive system, including but not limited to services relating to pregnancy, contraception, or the termination of a pregnancy, so long as the provision or assistance in receipt or provision of the services was in accordance with the laws of this State or would have been in accordance with the laws of this State if it occurred within this State; [(13)] (14)  Violation of chapter 329, the uniform controlled substances act, or any rule adopted thereunder except as provided in section 329-122; [(14)] (15)  Failure to report to the board, in writing, any disciplinary decision issued against the licensee or the applicant in another jurisdiction within thirty days after the disciplinary decision is issued; or [(15)] (16)  Submitting to or filing with the board any notice, statement, or other document required under this chapter, which is false or untrue or contains any material misstatement or omission of fact."
