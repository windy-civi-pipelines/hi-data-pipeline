A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO HISTORIC PRESERVATION REVIEWS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that historic
2 preservation review requirements play an essential role in the
3 protection and management of the State's historic places, burial
4 sites, and aviation artifacts by requiring state agencies and
5 offices to submit all projects that may affect historic
6 properties to the state historic preservation division of the
7 department of land and natural resources for review before
8 approval.
9 The legislature further finds that regulatory costs are a
10 major contributor to the high cost of housing in Hawaii, despite
11 the State facing an unprecedented housing crisis. According to
12 a 2024 report released by the university of Hawaii economic
13 research organization, the median sale price of a new two-
14 bedroom condominium in Hawaii was about $670,000, more than
15 double the national average price, and regulatory costs comprise
16 $387,000. Permit applicants face significant delays in
17 obtaining county permits that require historic preservation

1 review because of the overwhelming volume of submittals for
2 review. Consequently, much needed housing, economic
3 development, and critical infrastructure projects often face
4 significant delays in permit approvals and project
5 implementation.
6 The legislature additionally finds that due to the current
7 demand for the construction of housing and other critical
8 infrastructure, the state historic preservation division
9 consistently receives more reports than they have time to
10 review. According to the department of land and natural
11 resources report to the legislature in October 2022, project
12 reviews in the state historic preservation division's
13 archaeology branch face "a 6-month to 1-year backlog as the
14 volume of permit and project submissions have risen . . .".
15 The legislature also finds that allowing the state historic
16 preservation division to engage with third-party consultants
17 could help expedite the review process so that more housing
18 units can be produced in a timely manner. Delegating review
19 responsibilities will reduce the state historic preservation
20 division's intake load and allow the division to focus on core
21 historical review properties.

1 Therefore, legislature believes that it must take immediate
2 action to mitigate the overwhelming volume of submissions to the
3 state historic preservation division and the impacts on permit
4 applicants.
5 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to authorize the
6 department of land and natural resources, through the state
7 historic preservation division, to contract its review of
8 proposed state projects and projects affecting historic
9 properties to third-party consultants, under certain conditions.
10 SECTION 2. Section 6E-8, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
11 amended to read as follows:
12 "§6E-8 Review of effect of proposed state projects. (a)
13 Before any agency or officer of the State or its political
14 subdivisions commences any project [whiefe] that may affect
15 historic property, aviation artifact, or a burial site, the

17 department an opportunity for review of the effect of the

15 with the department. The agency or officer seeking to proceed
16 with the project, or any person, may appeal the department's
