THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the department of
2 education is responsible for submitting an annual computer
3 science legislative report by June 30 every year. However, the
4 department of education has recommended the inclusion of
5 academic quarter four computer science data from the schools in
6 the report, and the existing June 30 due date prohibits the
7 inclusion of that data. Thus, the department of education
8 prefers to delay the due date for the report to provide a more
9 robust computer science report.
10 Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to change the due
11 date of the department of education's annual computer science
12 legislative report from June 30 to October 31.
13 SECTION 2. Section 302A-323, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
14 amended by amending subsection (e) to read as follows:
15 " (e) By [June 30,—2022-,-] October 31, 2025, and by each
16 [June 30] October 31 thereafter, the superintendent shall submit
17 to the board and legislature a report of the computer science
