THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO THE ALA WAI CANAL.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the Ala Wai canal
2 was built in the 1920s and is the largest artificial waterway in
3 the State. Floating debris in the canal has been a persistent
4 problem, which severely harms recreational users and the State's
5 aquatic habitats in nearshore waters. In October 2024, heavy
6 rain in the watershed area caused serious concerns for
7 downstream tenants, including those at the Ala Wai small boat
8 harbor. The legislature recognizes that the division of boating
9 and ocean recreation of the department of land and natural
10 resources has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to collect
11 and dispose of the floating debris at the Ala Wai small boat
12 harbor. However, more funding and assistance is needed to
13 better manage floating debris in the Ala Wai canal.
14 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to appropriate
15 funds to the university of Hawaii to:

8 thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the
9 sum of $150,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for
