Section 1:
HB554 HD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 554 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO STATE HOLIDAYS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that 2024 marks the two‑hundred thirty-fifth anniversary of the first arrival of Asian immigrant workers in the State.  As of July 1, 2022, approximately 37.1 per cent of the State's population, or over five hundred thousand residents, were of Asian descent. The legislature recognizes that the Asian community in Hawaii has made significant contributions to the State's social, civic, and economic success, as well as its diverse and vibrant culture, which includes the celebration of the Lunar New Year. The Lunar New Year is joyously observed by numerous residents in the State and is celebrated by more than two-thirds of Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese Americans across the United States.  The Lunar New Year provides a time to renew one's family ties; reflect upon the past year; and wish for good fortune, health, and prosperity in the year ahead.    Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to designate the day of the second new moon after the winter solstice of each year as the Lunar New Year. SECTION 2.  Chapter 8, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§8-     Lunar New Year.  The day of the second new moon after the winter solstice of each year shall be known and designated as "Lunar New Year".  This day is not and shall not be construed to be a state holiday." SECTION 3. New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 4. This Act shall take effect on July 1, 3000. Report Title: Day of Observance; Lunar New Year Description: Designates the day of the second new moon after the winter solstice of each year as the Lunar New Year.  Effective 7/1/3000.  (HD1) The summary description of legislation appearing on this page is for informational purposes only and is not legislation or evidence of legislative intent.
