A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO THE STATE SHRIMP.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that anchialine pools,
2 also known as wai ‘dpae, are considered wahi pana, or culturally
3 sacred, special ecosystems in Hawaii. Of the seven hundred
4 recorded anchialine pools in the State, over six hundred fifty
5 pools are located in the county of Hawaii, mostly in the
6 districts of north and south Kona and Ka‘u.
7 The ‘dpae ‘ula is a species of shrimp endemic to Hawaii's
8 anchialine pools. The population of ‘dpae ‘ula is an important
9 indicator of the health of an anchialine pool. In healthy
10 anchialine pools, the population of ‘dpae ‘ula is abundant.
11 The legislature further finds that the designation of the
12 ‘dpae ‘ula as the state shrimp will raise awareness of the ‘dpae
13 ‘ula and support efforts to protect anchialine pool ecosystems
14 throughout the State as a natural resource. In designating the
15 ‘dpae ‘ula as the state shrimp, the legislature does not intend

1 to prevent or impact the traditional and ongoing practice of
2 harvesting ‘dpae to be used in ‘dpelu fishing.
3 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish ‘dpae
4 ‘ula as the state shrimp.
5 SECTION 2. Chapter 5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended
6 by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to
7 read as follows:
8 "§5- State shrimp. The ‘dpae ‘ula (Halocaridina rubra) ,
9 also known as the red shrimp, is established and designated as
10 the official shrimp of the State.”
11 SECTION 3. New statutory material is underscored.
12 SECTION 4. This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2025.
