SB1259 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1259 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to agricultural education. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that agricultural education is essential for fostering an understanding of sustainable practices and food security among students in grades kindergarten through twelve.  Hawaii's unique geographical location and cultural heritage make it imperative to promote agricultural education to ensure the sustainability of local food systems and the preservation of traditional farming practices. The legislature further finds that the State faces several challenges that underscore the need for dedicated agricultural education programs.  As a remote island state, Hawaii imports approximately eighty-five to ninety per cent of food, making the State susceptible to supply chain disruptions.  Further, the State's natural resources are finite, making natural resource management a significant priority for the future of the agricultural industry.  While there is potential for agriculture to become a major industry for the State, creation of strong agricultural education programs are necessary to ensure longevity and continued growth. Investing in agricultural education can also lead to diverse economic opportunities, contributing to the State's economic growth and resilience. The legislature also finds that the health and well-being of Hawaii's people is of paramount importance.  Presently, efforts to revitalize Native Hawaiian traditional and customary practices, including cultivation of taro and maintenance of fishponds (loko ia), have contributed to the preservation of these practices.  Further, the growth of the agricultural industry through farming and cultivation of native plant species has the potential to create healthier lifestyles for Hawaii's people. The legislature recognizes that several states have introduced similar legislation and programs to support agricultural education and land dedication.  California, Florida, Iowa, New York, and Texas have implemented programs to expand access to agricultural education programs among students, emphasizing the growing support for agriculture and sustainability.  The State has the potential to become an innovator in agriculture and education based on geography, unique natural resources, and incorporation of Native Hawaiian history and traditional and customary practices. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish the land dedication for agricultural education program to require real estate developers to dedicate a portion of land for agricultural education programs within the department of education. SECTION 2. Chapter 302A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new subpart to part VI to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "SUBPart     . land dedication for agricultural education. §302A-A  Definitions.  As used in this part: "Agricultural education" means educational programs and activities that focus on the principles and practices of agriculture, including but not limited to crop cultivation, animal husbandry, and sustainable farming.
