Section 1:
SB1652 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1652 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to climate change. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "Climate Change Superfund Act". SECTION 2.  The legislature finds that climate change, resulting primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels, is an immediate, grave threat to the State's communities, environment, and economy.  In addition to mitigating the further buildup of greenhouse gases, the State must take action to adapt to certain consequences of climate change that are irreversible, including rising sea levels, increasing temperatures, extreme weather events, flooding, heat waves, toxic algal blooms, and other climate change-driven threats.  Maintaining the State's quality of life into the future, particularly for young people, who will experience greater impacts from climate change over their lifetimes, will be one of the State's greatest challenges over the next three decades. Meeting that challenge will require a shared commitment of purpose, significant investments in new or upgraded infrastructure, and new revenue sources to pay for those investments. The legislature further finds that, based on decades of research, it is now possible to determine with great accuracy the share of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere by specific fossil fuel companies over the last seventy years or more, making it possible to assign liability to and require compensation from companies commensurate with their emissions during a given time period. It is therefore the intent of the legislature to establish a climate change adaptation cost recovery program that will require companies that have contributed significantly to the buildup of climate change-driving greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to bear a proportionate share of the cost of infrastructure investments and other expenses necessary for comprehensive adaptation to the impacts of climate change in the State. The obligation to pay under the program established by this Act is based on the fossil fuel companies' historic contribution to the buildup of greenhouse gases that is largely responsible for climate change.  The program will operate under a standard of strict liability, meaning companies will be required to pay into the fund because the use of their products caused the pollution.  No finding of wrongdoing is required. Further, payments by historical polluters into the climate change adaptation cost recovery program will be used for new or upgraded infrastructure needs such as coastal wetlands restoration; storm water drainage system upgrades; energy efficient cooling systems in public and private buildings, including schools and public housing; support for programs addressing climate-driven public health challenges; and responses to extreme weather events, all of which are necessary to protect the public safety and welfare in the face of the growing impacts of climate change.  The cost to the State of climate adaptation investments through 2050 is estimated to reach several billion dollars. The legislature also finds that recent science has determined that the largest one hundred fossil fuel producing companies are responsible for more than seventy per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions since 1988, and therefore bear a much higher share of responsibility for climate damage to the State than what is represented by the amount assessed against these companies. This Act is not intended to intrude on the authority of the federal government in areas where it has preempted the right of the states to legislate.  This Act is remedial in nature, seeking compensation for damages resulting from the past actions of polluters. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish the climate change adaptation cost recovery program to secure compensatory payments from responsible parties based on a standard of strict liability to provide a source of revenue for climate change adaptive infrastructure projects within the State. SECTION 3.

Raw Text:
SB1652 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1652 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to climate change. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "Climate Change Superfund Act". SECTION 2.  The legislature finds that climate change, resulting primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels, is an immediate, grave threat to the State's communities, environment, and economy.  In addition to mitigating the further buildup of greenhouse gases, the State must take action to adapt to certain consequences of climate change that are irreversible, including rising sea levels, increasing temperatures, extreme weather events, flooding, heat waves, toxic algal blooms, and other climate change-driven threats.  Maintaining the State's quality of life into the future, particularly for young people, who will experience greater impacts from climate change over their lifetimes, will be one of the State's greatest challenges over the next three decades. Meeting that challenge will require a shared commitment of purpose, significant investments in new or upgraded infrastructure, and new revenue sources to pay for those investments. The legislature further finds that, based on decades of research, it is now possible to determine with great accuracy the share of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere by specific fossil fuel companies over the last seventy years or more, making it possible to assign liability to and require compensation from companies commensurate with their emissions during a given time period. It is therefore the intent of the legislature to establish a climate change adaptation cost recovery program that will require companies that have contributed significantly to the buildup of climate change-driving greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to bear a proportionate share of the cost of infrastructure investments and other expenses necessary for comprehensive adaptation to the impacts of climate change in the State. The obligation to pay under the program established by this Act is based on the fossil fuel companies' historic contribution to the buildup of greenhouse gases that is largely responsible for climate change.  The program will operate under a standard of strict liability, meaning companies will be required to pay into the fund because the use of their products caused the pollution.  No finding of wrongdoing is required. Further, payments by historical polluters into the climate change adaptation cost recovery program will be used for new or upgraded infrastructure needs such as coastal wetlands restoration; storm water drainage system upgrades; energy efficient cooling systems in public and private buildings, including schools and public housing; support for programs addressing climate-driven public health challenges; and responses to extreme weather events, all of which are necessary to protect the public safety and welfare in the face of the growing impacts of climate change.  The cost to the State of climate adaptation investments through 2050 is estimated to reach several billion dollars. The legislature also finds that recent science has determined that the largest one hundred fossil fuel producing companies are responsible for more than seventy per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions since 1988, and therefore bear a much higher share of responsibility for climate damage to the State than what is represented by the amount assessed against these companies. This Act is not intended to intrude on the authority of the federal government in areas where it has preempted the right of the states to legislate.  This Act is remedial in nature, seeking compensation for damages resulting from the past actions of polluters. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish the climate change adaptation cost recovery program to secure compensatory payments from responsible parties based on a standard of strict liability to provide a source of revenue for climate change adaptive infrastructure projects within the State. SECTION 3. Chapter 225M, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part .  Climate change adaptation cost recovery program §225M-A  Definitions.  As used in this part: "Applicable payment date" means September 30 of the second calendar year following the effective date of Act      , Session Laws of Hawaii 2025.
