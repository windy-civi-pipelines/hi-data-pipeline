Section 1:
SB685 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 685 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO TAXATION of pollution. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The goal of this Act is to reduce Hawaii's greenhouse gas emissions in furtherance of the State's zero emissions clean economy target established in Act 15, Session Laws of Hawaii 2018, and to provide financial relief in a progressive manner to the residents of the State.  To achieve this goal, this Act establishes a carbon cashback program that utilizes: (1)  The environmental response, energy, and food security tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and (2)  Refundable tax credits to distribute the proceeds of the tax in equal shares to taxpayers of the State, who will bear the brunt of the expected increase in costs of fossil fuel products. One of the tools available for reducing greenhouse gas emissions is to tax fossil fuels.  When the tax is sufficient, it has been proven to be effective in substantially reducing consumption.  Hawaii has a thirty-year history of assessing a tax on fossil fuel distributors for fossil fuel distribution in the State.  However, the existing tax rate is not designed to reduce consumption, but rather to generate funding to mitigate some of the risks and adverse impacts of fossil fuel use and climate change.  This Act raises the tax in increments, gradually increasing its effect in reducing the consumption of fossil fuels. The environmental response tax was established by Act 300, Session Laws of Hawaii 1993.  Initially, the tax rate for petroleum products was five cents per barrel.  The tax revenue was used to: (1)  Prevent, remove, and remediate oil spills; (2)  Support oil recycling programs; and (3)  Address concerns related to underground storage tanks. Later, Act 73, Session Laws of Hawaii 2010, increased the tax to $1.05 per barrel and renamed the tax the environmental response, energy, and food security tax.  Act 73 also expanded the purpose of the tax by funding activities that mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change. The legislature finds that a policy that taxes fossil fuels based on their emissions, often called a carbon tax, and returns to people the revenues, commonly known as dividends, has received broad support from economists.  More than three thousand six hundred economists have signed a statement endorsing the carbon tax and dividend concept, including twenty‑eight Nobel Laureate economists, four former Chairs of the Federal Reserve, and fifteen former Chairs of the Council of Economic Advisors. The statement reads, in part, "[a] carbon tax offers the most cost-effective lever to reduce carbon emissions at the scale and speed that is necessary." The statement goes on to say that the carbon tax should be increased until emission reduction goals are met. It continues by stating, "[t]o maximize the fairness and political viability of a rising carbon tax, all the revenue should be returned directly to U.S. citizens through equal lump-sum rebates.  The majority of American families, including the most vulnerable, will benefit financially by receiving more in 'carbon dividends' than they pay in increased energy prices." In accordance with Act 122, Session Laws of Hawaii 2019, the state energy office commissioned "a study of carbon pricing, including whether and how a carbon pricing policy shall be implemented in Hawaii".  In April 2021, the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization (UHERO) completed the study in April 2021, entitled, "Carbon Pricing Assessment for Hawaii:  Economic and Greenhouse Gas Impacts".  The study concluded that a carbon tax and dividend policy would substantially reduce the consumption of fossil fuels, and most of Hawaii's households would receive a net financial benefit, with lower-income households gaining the most. This Act expands the purpose of the environmental response, energy, and food security tax in order to effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and renames the tax as the environmental response, energy, carbon emissions, and food security tax.  The increase in the tax under this Act is informally referred herein as the "carbon emissions tax" for descriptive purposes and to distinguish it from the existing tax rate.  The carbon emissions tax rates are derived from the low tax scenario considered in the UHERO study, updated for inflation.  The tax rates in the UHERO study, which are expressed in dollars per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent, are converted to the units used in the environmental response, energy, carbon emissions, and food security tax, which are dollars per barrel for petroleum products and dollars per million British thermal units for other types of fossil fuels, such as natural gas. The carbon dioxide equivalent factors for petroleum and non-petroleum fossil fuels include the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.  These emission factors are taken from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories (modified April 1, 2021). The progression of the increase in the carbon emissions tax differs from that which is considered in the UHERO study by starting lower in the initial year to avoid a sudden large increase in prices, then increasing until the tenth year of implementation, when it approximates the rate considered in the UHERO study at that point.  From that year forward, the annual increase in the tax only accounts for expected inflation.  Each year, taxpayers of the State will receive, in the form of refundable tax credits, a total amount equivalent to the expected carbon emissions tax revenue from the previous year, less an amount needed to administer the program, including a public awareness campaign.  Every individual taxpayer will be eligible for the same refundable tax credit in any particular year, and every dependent will be eligible for half that amount. The following illustrates how the carbon emissions tax and refundable tax credits will progress.  In the first year of implementation, 2026, the carbon emissions tax is $0.05 per gallon for petroleum products, and the refundable tax credit is $40 per individual taxpayer and $20 per dependent, available the following year when the tax return is filed.  In the fifth year, 2030, the carbon emissions tax is $0.40 per gallon, and the refundable tax credit is $283 per individual taxpayer and $141 per dependent.  In 2035, when the refundable tax credit peaks, the carbon emissions tax is $0.90 per gallon, and the refundable tax credit is $473 per individual taxpayer and $237 per dependent. This Act also reenacts the agricultural development and food security special fund, which was repealed in 2021.  At that time, the State found itself in a budget crisis due to a reduction in the general fund, as a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.  Moneys from the repealed agricultural development and food security special fund were used to fortify the general fund.  The legislature finds that the State is now in a more stable financial condition.  The legislature further finds that agriculture and food security are just as critical to Hawaii's future as ever, and for those reasons the special fund is reenacted. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Establish a carbon cashback program by: (A)  Amending the environmental response, energy, and food security tax to address carbon emissions; and (B)  Establishing a refundable tax credit to mitigate the effect of the tax on carbon emissions for Hawaii's taxpayers; and (2)  Reenact the agricultural development and food security special fund. SECTION 2. Chapter 141, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§141-     Agricultural development and food security special fund; establishment.  (a)  There is established within the state treasury the agricultural development and food security special fund. (b) The following moneys shall be deposited into the special fund: (1)  The portion of the environmental response, energy, carbon emissions, and food security tax specified under section 243-3.5; (2)  Any appropriation by the legislature into the special fund; (3)  Any grant or donation made to the special fund; and (4)  Any interest earned on the balance of the special fund. (c) Subject to legislative appropriation, moneys in the special fund may be expended for the following purposes: (1)  The awarding of grants to farmers for agricultural production or processing activity; (2)  The acquisition of real property for agricultural production or processing activity; (3)  The improvement of real property, irrigation systems, and transportation networks necessary to promote agricultural production or processing activity; (4)  The purchase of equipment necessary for agricultural production or processing activity; (5)  The conduct of research on and testing of agricultural products and markets; (6)  The funding of agricultural inspector positions within the department of agriculture; (7)  The promotion and marketing of agricultural products grown or raised in the State; and (8)  Any other activity that is intended to increase agricultural production or processing and that may lead to reduced importation of food, fodder, or feed from outside the State. (d) No later than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular session, the department of agriculture shall submit a report to the legislature on the status and progress of existing programs and activities and the status of new programs and activities funded under the agricultural development and food security special fund.  The report shall also include: (1)  The spending plan of the agricultural development and food security special fund; (2)  All expenditures of agricultural development and food security special fund moneys; (3)  The targeted markets of the expenditures, including reasons for selecting those markets; (4)  The persons to be served using the expenditures; and (5)  The specific objectives of the expenditures, including measurable outcomes." SECTION 3. Chapter 231, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§231-     Carbon emissions tax and dividend special fund.  (a)  There is established the carbon emissions tax and dividend special fund, into which shall be deposited the amount specified by section 243-3.5. (b)  Moneys in the carbon emissions tax and dividend special fund shall be administered by the department of taxation and shall be expended for salaries, contracted services, supplies, and other administrative expenses to: (1)  Administer the environmental response, energy, carbon emissions, and food security tax; (2)  Administer the refundable tax credits established by section 235-   ; and (3)  Increase public awareness and interest in the refundable tax credits established by section 235-   ." SECTION 4. Chapter 235, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part III to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§235-     Carbon cashback tax credit.  (a) There shall be allowed to each qualifying taxpayer subject to the tax imposed under this chapter, a carbon cashback tax credit that shall be applied against the taxpayer's net income tax liability, if any, imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in which the credit is properly claimed.

SB685 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 685 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO TAXATION of pollution. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The goal of this Act is to reduce Hawaii's greenhouse gas emissions in furtherance of the State's zero emissions clean economy target established in Act 15, Session Laws of Hawaii 2018, and to provide financial relief in a progressive manner to the residents of the State.  To achieve this goal, this Act establishes a carbon cashback program that utilizes: (1)  The environmental response, energy, and food security tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and (2)  Refundable tax credits to distribute the proceeds of the tax in equal shares to taxpayers of the State, who will bear the brunt of the expected increase in costs of fossil fuel products. One of the tools available for reducing greenhouse gas emissions is to tax fossil fuels.  When the tax is sufficient, it has been proven to be effective in substantially reducing consumption.  Hawaii has a thirty-year history of assessing a tax on fossil fuel distributors for fossil fuel distribution in the State.  However, the existing tax rate is not designed to reduce consumption, but rather to generate funding to mitigate some of the risks and adverse impacts of fossil fuel use and climate change.  This Act raises the tax in increments, gradually increasing its effect in reducing the consumption of fossil fuels. The environmental response tax was established by Act 300, Session Laws of Hawaii 1993.  Initially, the tax rate for petroleum products was five cents per barrel.  The tax revenue was used to: (1)  Prevent, remove, and remediate oil spills; (2)  Support oil recycling programs; and (3)  Address concerns related to underground storage tanks. Later, Act 73, Session Laws of Hawaii 2010, increased the tax to $1.05 per barrel and renamed the tax the environmental response, energy, and food security tax.  Act 73 also expanded the purpose of the tax by funding activities that mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change. The legislature finds that a policy that taxes fossil fuels based on their emissions, often called a carbon tax, and returns to people the revenues, commonly known as dividends, has received broad support from economists.  More than three thousand six hundred economists have signed a statement endorsing the carbon tax and dividend concept, including twenty‑eight Nobel Laureate economists, four former Chairs of the Federal Reserve, and fifteen former Chairs of the Council of Economic Advisors. The statement reads, in part, "[a] carbon tax offers the most cost-effective lever to reduce carbon emissions at the scale and speed that is necessary." The statement goes on to say that the carbon tax should be increased until emission reduction goals are met. It continues by stating, "[t]o maximize the fairness and political viability of a rising carbon tax, all the revenue should be returned directly to U.S. citizens through equal lump-sum rebates.  The majority of American families, including the most vulnerable, will benefit financially by receiving more in 'carbon dividends' than they pay in increased energy prices." In accordance with Act 122, Session Laws of Hawaii 2019, the state energy office commissioned "a study of carbon pricing, including whether and how a carbon pricing policy shall be implemented in Hawaii".  In April 2021, the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization (UHERO) completed the study in April 2021, entitled, "Carbon Pricing Assessment for Hawaii:  Economic and Greenhouse Gas Impacts".  The study concluded that a carbon tax and dividend policy would substantially reduce the consumption of fossil fuels, and most of Hawaii's households would receive a net financial benefit, with lower-income households gaining the most. This Act expands the purpose of the environmental response, energy, and food security tax in order to effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and renames the tax as the environmental response, energy, carbon emissions, and food security tax.  The increase in the tax under this Act is informally referred herein as the "carbon emissions tax" for descriptive purposes and to distinguish it from the existing tax rate.  The carbon emissions tax rates are derived from the low tax scenario considered in the UHERO study, updated for inflation.  The tax rates in the UHERO study, which are expressed in dollars per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent, are converted to the units used in the environmental response, energy, carbon emissions, and food security tax, which are dollars per barrel for petroleum products and dollars per million British thermal units for other types of fossil fuels, such as natural gas. The carbon dioxide equivalent factors for petroleum and non-petroleum fossil fuels include the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.  These emission factors are taken from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories (modified April 1, 2021). The progression of the increase in the carbon emissions tax differs from that which is considered in the UHERO study by starting lower in the initial year to avoid a sudden large increase in prices, then increasing until the tenth year of implementation, when it approximates the rate considered in the UHERO study at that point.  From that year forward, the annual increase in the tax only accounts for expected inflation.  Each year, taxpayers of the State will receive, in the form of refundable tax credits, a total amount equivalent to the expected carbon emissions tax revenue from the previous year, less an amount needed to administer the program, including a public awareness campaign.  Every individual taxpayer will be eligible for the same refundable tax credit in any particular year, and every dependent will be eligible for half that amount. The following illustrates how the carbon emissions tax and refundable tax credits will progress.  In the first year of implementation, 2026, the carbon emissions tax is $0.05 per gallon for petroleum products, and the refundable tax credit is $40 per individual taxpayer and $20 per dependent, available the following year when the tax return is filed.  In the fifth year, 2030, the carbon emissions tax is $0.40 per gallon, and the refundable tax credit is $283 per individual taxpayer and $141 per dependent.  In 2035, when the refundable tax credit peaks, the carbon emissions tax is $0.90 per gallon, and the refundable tax credit is $473 per individual taxpayer and $237 per dependent. This Act also reenacts the agricultural development and food security special fund, which was repealed in 2021.  At that time, the State found itself in a budget crisis due to a reduction in the general fund, as a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.  Moneys from the repealed agricultural development and food security special fund were used to fortify the general fund.  The legislature finds that the State is now in a more stable financial condition.  The legislature further finds that agriculture and food security are just as critical to Hawaii's future as ever, and for those reasons the special fund is reenacted. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Establish a carbon cashback program by: (A)  Amending the environmental response, energy, and food security tax to address carbon emissions; and (B)  Establishing a refundable tax credit to mitigate the effect of the tax on carbon emissions for Hawaii's taxpayers; and (2)  Reenact the agricultural development and food security special fund. SECTION 2. Chapter 141, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§141-     Agricultural development and food security special fund; establishment.  (a)  There is established within the state treasury the agricultural development and food security special fund. (b) The following moneys shall be deposited into the special fund: (1)  The portion of the environmental response, energy, carbon emissions, and food security tax specified under section 243-3.5; (2)  Any appropriation by the legislature into the special fund; (3)  Any grant or donation made to the special fund; and (4)  Any interest earned on the balance of the special fund. (c) Subject to legislative appropriation, moneys in the special fund may be expended for the following purposes: (1)  The awarding of grants to farmers for agricultural production or processing activity; (2)  The acquisition of real property for agricultural production or processing activity; (3)  The improvement of real property, irrigation systems, and transportation networks necessary to promote agricultural production or processing activity; (4)  The purchase of equipment necessary for agricultural production or processing activity; (5)  The conduct of research on and testing of agricultural products and markets; (6)  The funding of agricultural inspector positions within the department of agriculture; (7)  The promotion and marketing of agricultural products grown or raised in the State; and (8)  Any other activity that is intended to increase agricultural production or processing and that may lead to reduced importation of food, fodder, or feed from outside the State. (d) No later than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular session, the department of agriculture shall submit a report to the legislature on the status and progress of existing programs and activities and the status of new programs and activities funded under the agricultural development and food security special fund.  The report shall also include: (1)  The spending plan of the agricultural development and food security special fund; (2)  All expenditures of agricultural development and food security special fund moneys; (3)  The targeted markets of the expenditures, including reasons for selecting those markets; (4)  The persons to be served using the expenditures; and (5)  The specific objectives of the expenditures, including measurable outcomes." SECTION 3. Chapter 231, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§231-     Carbon emissions tax and dividend special fund.  (a)  There is established the carbon emissions tax and dividend special fund, into which shall be deposited the amount specified by section 243-3.5. (b)  Moneys in the carbon emissions tax and dividend special fund shall be administered by the department of taxation and shall be expended for salaries, contracted services, supplies, and other administrative expenses to: (1)  Administer the environmental response, energy, carbon emissions, and food security tax; (2)  Administer the refundable tax credits established by section 235-   ; and (3)  Increase public awareness and interest in the refundable tax credits established by section 235-   ." SECTION 4. Chapter 235, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part III to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§235-     Carbon cashback tax credit.  (a) There shall be allowed to each qualifying taxpayer subject to the tax imposed under this chapter, a carbon cashback tax credit that shall be applied against the taxpayer's net income tax liability, if any, imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in which the credit is properly claimed.

All claims for the tax credit under this section, including amended claims, shall be filed on or before the end of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the credit may be claimed.  Failure to comply with the foregoing provision shall constitute a waiver of the right to claim the credit.
