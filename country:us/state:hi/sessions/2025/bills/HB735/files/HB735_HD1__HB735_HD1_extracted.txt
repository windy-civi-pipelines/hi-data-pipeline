Section 1:
HB735 HD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 735 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO WASTEWATER. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that existing administrative rules allow an individual wastewater system to serve no more than five bedrooms, whether the five bedrooms are in one dwelling unit or two dwelling units.  However, the definition of a dwelling unit under chapter 62, Hawaii administrative rules, does not clearly consider the varied types of development, such as dwelling units that may have exterior bedrooms without a kitchen or guest houses with a bathroom but without a kitchen.  Certain dwelling units may be prohibited from using an individual wastewater system solely because the bedrooms are outside the dwelling unit. The purpose of this Act is to allow an individual wastewater system to serve up to five bedrooms, regardless of the number of dwelling units or accessory units, whether attached or detached, with certain exclusions. SECTION 2.  Chapter 342D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§342D-     Individual wastewater system; dwelling units.  An individual wastewater system may serve up to five bedrooms, regardless of the number of dwelling units or accessory units as defined by the counties, whether attached or detached; provided that this shall not apply to any new requests to connect additional dwelling units to an existing cesspool." SECTION 3.  New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 3000. Report Title: Individual Wastewater Systems; Dwelling Units; Accessory Units; Cesspools Description: Allows an individual wastewater system to serve up to five bedrooms, regardless of the number of dwelling units or accessory units, whether attached or detached, with certain exclusions.  Effective 7/1/3000.  (HD1) The summary description of legislation appearing on this page is for informational purposes only and is not legislation or evidence of legislative intent.
