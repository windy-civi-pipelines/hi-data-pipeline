SB1184 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1184 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to agricultural support. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii's geographic isolation presents unique challenges for farmers, ranchers, and local food producers, particularly in the form of high transportation costs.  Located thousands of miles from the mainland United States, Hawaii relies heavily on shipping for the import and export of goods, significantly increasing the cost of transporting agricultural inputs such as feed, fertilizer, and equipment, as well as the export of locally grown and produced products.  According to a 2020 survey by the department of agriculture, thirty-nine per cent of farmers, ranchers, and allied operators identified shipping costs as a significant barrier to expanding their operations, particularly on Maui, Kauai, and Hawaii Island.  This suggests that transportation expenses have been a persistent concern for the State's agricultural sector. The legislature further finds that the United States Department of Agriculture's Reimbursement Transportation Cost Payment Program (RTCP) has successfully supported geographically disadvantaged farmers and ranchers by offsetting high transportation costs, enabling them to maintain competitiveness in the marketplace.  In 2022, the RTCP provided $3,000,000 in reimbursements, with increased funding in 2023 helping more producers access essential resources, expand their operations, and contribute to the resilience of rural and remote agricultural communities. The legislature additionally finds that establishing a state-level program like the RTCP in the State would alleviate the high transportation costs faced by local farmers, ranchers, and food producers, enabling them to operate more sustainably and remain competitive in local and export markets.  According to the United States Department of Agriculture's latest agricultural census, Hawaii has approximately seven thousand farms.  Although not all farms may qualify under the United States Department of Agriculture's "geographically disadvantaged" criteria, a significant proportion likely would qualify at the state level. Establishing a state program like the RTCP would support Hawaii's efforts to bolster food security and reduce dependence on imported goods, aligning with supporting the State's sustainability goals.  Additionally, such a program would stimulate economic growth by allowing producers to reinvest savings into expanding operations, creating jobs, and enhancing the overall resilience of the State's agricultural sector and rural communities. Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to support the agriculture industry and economic growth in Hawaii by: (1)  Establishing the Hawaii agricultural transportation assistance program, to consist of a reimbursement program for geographically disadvantaged farmers and livestock producers to mitigate the high costs of transportation for agricultural products, inputs, and supplies, and a grant program to assist small-scale farmers, ranchers, and agricultural producers or agricultural producers in rural or underserved areas with transportation costs directly related to the production and distribution of agricultural commodities; and (2)  Requiring the department of agriculture to submit annual reports to the legislature on the progress and outcomes of the programs. SECTION 2.  Chapter 141, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part    .  hawaii agricultural transportation ASSISTANCE program §141-A  Definitions.  As used in this part: "Department" means the department of agriculture.
