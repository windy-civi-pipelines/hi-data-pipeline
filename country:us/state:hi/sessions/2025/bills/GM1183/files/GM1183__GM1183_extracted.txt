STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO CRIMINAL HISTORY RECORD CHECKS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAH:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the Internal Revenue
2 Service requires fingerprint-based background checks on current
3 and prospective employees and contractors who receive access to
4 federal tax information. Authorization to access
5 fingerprint-based background checks is provided through state
6 statute approved by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Act
7 35, Session Laws of Hawaii 2021, established sections 28-17 and
8 846-2.7 (b) (49), Hawaii Revised Statutes, to authorize the
9 department of the attorney general to conduct fingerprint-based
10 background checks through the Federal Bureau of Investigation on
11 current or prospective employees or employees or agents of
12 contractors. Upon review of section 846-2.7 (b) (49), Hawaii
13 Revised Statutes, the Federal Bureau of Investigation determined
14 that the statute failed the requirement of identifying the
15 specific category of persons falling within the statute's
16 purview, as the term "agents of contractors" was overly broad
17 and not defined in the statute.

C.D. 1
1 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to repeal the term
2 "agents of contractors" and clarify that a contractor,
3 contractor's employee, or subcontractor who has access to
4 federal tax information held by the department of the attorney
5 general may be subject to fingerprint-based background checks.
6 SECTION 2. Section 28-17, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
7 amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows:
8 "(b) The department of the attorney general may terminate
9 or deny employment to any current or prospective employee, or
10 terminate or refuse to secure the services of any contractor, if
11 the department of the attorney general finds by reason of the
12 background investigation conducted under subsection (a) that the
13 current or prospective employee [or employee- or agent of thc]^
14 contractor, contractor's employee, or subcontractor poses a risk
15 to the security of federal tax information. Termination or
16 denial of employment, or termination or refusal to secure the
17 services of any contractor, under this subsection, shall only
18 occur after appropriate notification to the current or
19 prospective employee [or—cmployoo or agont of the]^ contractorj^
20 contractor's employee, or subcontractor of the findings of the
21 background investigation, and after the current or prospective

THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO CRIMINAL HISTORY RECORD CHECKS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAH:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the Internal Revenue
2 Service requires fingerprint-based background checks on current
3 and prospective employees and contractors who receive access to
4 federal tax information. Authorization to access
5 fingerprint-based background checks is provided through state
6 statute approved by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Act
7 35, Session Laws of Hawaii 2021, established sections 28-17 and
8 846-2.7 (b) (49), Hawaii Revised Statutes, to authorize the
9 department of the attorney general to conduct fingerprint-based
10 background checks through the Federal Bureau of Investigation on
11 current or prospective employees or employees or agents of
12 contractors. Upon review of section 846-2.7 (b) (49), Hawaii
13 Revised Statutes, the Federal Bureau of Investigation determined
14 that the statute failed the requirement of identifying the
15 specific category of persons falling within the statute's
16 purview, as the term "agents of contractors" was overly broad
17 and not defined in the statute.

C.D. 1
1 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to repeal the term
2 "agents of contractors" and clarify that a contractor,
3 contractor's employee, or subcontractor who has access to
4 federal tax information held by the department of the attorney
5 general may be subject to fingerprint-based background checks.
6 SECTION 2. Section 28-17, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
7 amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows:
8 "(b) The department of the attorney general may terminate
9 or deny employment to any current or prospective employee, or
10 terminate or refuse to secure the services of any contractor, if
11 the department of the attorney general finds by reason of the
12 background investigation conducted under subsection (a) that the
13 current or prospective employee [or employee- or agent of thc]^
14 contractor, contractor's employee, or subcontractor poses a risk
15 to the security of federal tax information. Termination or
16 denial of employment, or termination or refusal to secure the
17 services of any contractor, under this subsection, shall only
18 occur after appropriate notification to the current or
19 prospective employee [or—cmployoo or agont of the]^ contractorj^
20 contractor's employee, or subcontractor of the findings of the
21 background investigation, and after the current or prospective

4 any applicable appeal rights under chapters 76 and 89 or
5 administrative rules of the department of the attorney general."
