C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO FIRE PROTECTION.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION I. The legislature finds that in the aftermath of
2 the 2023 Maui wildfires, the department of the attorney general
3 initiated an investigation and retained the independent,
4 third-party Fire Safety Research Institute, part of UL Research
5 Institutes, to assess the performance of state and county
6 agencies in preparing for and responding to the 2023 Maui
7 wildfires. The investigation led to three reports -- a
8 "Phase 1" comprehensive timeline report, a "Phase 2" incident
9 analysis report, and a "Phase 3" forward-looking report.
10 The "Phase 3" forward-looking report organized these
11 findings and provided a prioritized list of action items of
12 changes to be made to improve Hawaii's response to wildfires for
13 the State and all counties. The report calls for changes and
14 improvements to the office of the state fire marshal, which was
15 established by Act 209, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024 — among
16 them, bolstering statutory authority of the office of the state
17 fire marshal to address the wide spectrum of fire safety issues.
