A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that Hawaii is
2 experiencing a climate emergency. The effects of climate
3 change, such as rising temperatures, prolonged droughts, and
4 increasingly destructive and deadly weather events, are felt
5 across the island chain. These impacts threaten not only our
6 vibrant ecosystems but also the people of Hawaii and the State's
7 economic sustainability. To ensure the health and safety of
8 Hawaii's lands, waters, and people, as well as its economic
9 viability, successful mitigation of and adaptation to climate
10 change are imperative.
11 The legislature further finds that economic development
12 cannot be separated from environmental stewardship. Hawaii's
13 economy is deeply reliant on its natural resources, from tourism
14 and agriculture to marine industries and renewable energy.
15 Degradation of these resources due to climate change and
16 environmental mismanagement will result in significant financial
17 losses across multiple sectors. By investing in sustainability,

1 the State secures long-term economic stability while preserving
2 its unique landscapes and biodiversity.
3 The legislature also finds that climate resilience must be
4 integrated into all economic planning efforts. Resiliency
5 measures, such as sustainable land use practices, shoreline
6 protection, and forestry projects, ensure that Hawaii’s economy
7 remains robust in the face of climate-related disasters.
8 Without proactive investment, businesses and communities will
9 continue to suffer financial losses due to increased flooding,
10 wildfires, and extreme weather events.
11 The legislature additionally finds that investing in
12 Hawaii's environment is, in itself, economic development.
13 Furthermore, the legislature finds that as contemplated, the
14 transient accommodations tax is intended to be applied fully and
15 equitably whenever a transient accommodation is furnished within
16 the State. Whereas hotel and lodging establishments have
17 complied with and pay their due share of transient
18 accommodations taxes, tax collections on short-term rental
19 operators have fallen short. Moreover, there is currently no
20 transient accommodations tax levied on cruise ships, which in
21 2024, accounted for 972,820 passenger port calls at port

1 facilities under the jurisdiction of the department of
2 transportation. Supporting sustainable practices protects the
3 islands' unique ecosystems while simultaneously fostering
4 economic growth. This support includes funding renewable energy
5 projects, enhancing conservation efforts, and promoting
6 environmental tourism initiatives. These investments preserve
7 natural resources, reduce carbon footprints, and stimulate
8 economic opportunities, such as job creation in renewable energy
9 sectors and eco-friendly tourism.
10 In addition, the legislature finds that Hawaii has an
11 opportunity to be a global leader in sustainable innovation. By
12 investing in conservation-focused business models, the State can
13 attract investors and industries that prioritize sustainability.
14 These initiatives not only protect the environment but also
15 diversify the economy, reducing reliance on tourism and
16 traditional extractive industries.
17 The legislature further finds that Hawaii's cultural
18 heritage and traditions are deeply connected to its natural
19 environment. The protection and restoration of forests, coral
20 reefs, and coastal ecosystems safeguard the foundation of Native
21 Hawaiian practices and knowledge systems. Investing in

1 environmental conservation ensures that these traditions can
2 continue to thrive, enriching community well-being and cultural
3 tourism.
4 The legislature also finds that a failure to act now will
5 result in increased costs in the future. The economic burden of
6 climate inaction will far exceed the cost of proactive
7 investment in mitigation and adaptation strategies.
8 Infrastructure damage, loss of biodiversity, increased health
9 issues due to heat and pollution, and disruptions to tourism and
10 agriculture will place a heavy financial strain on the State if
11 environmental action is delayed.
12 The legislature additionally finds that a strong commitment
13 to environmental sustainability enhances Hawaii's reputation as
14 a world-class destination for ecotourism. Travelers are
15 increasingly seeking destinations that prioritize
16 sustainability, and by investing in conservation efforts,
17 renewable energy, and sustainable tourism practices, Hawaii can
18 maintain its competitive edge in the global tourism market while
19 ensuring the long-term viability of its natural resources.
20 The legislature therefore declares that investment in
21 climate resilience and environmental sustainability is a

1 fundamental component of Hawaii's economic development strategy.
2 By prioritizing policies and funding mechanisms that support
3 climate action, conservation, and sustainable industries, Hawaii
4 can build a more resilient, prosperous, and environmentally
5 secure future for all residents and visitors.
6 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
7 (1) Increase the transient accommodations tax rate for
8 transient accommodations and resort time shares;
9 (2) Assess the transient accommodations tax on the gross
10 receipts derived from cruise fares;
11 (3) Require the governor to request in the executive
12 budget or supplemental budget that an amount of
13 general funds that approximates the additional
14 transient accommodations tax revenue generated by this
15 Act be expended equally to advance certain climate
16 change mitigation and tourism projects; and
17 (4) 7\mend the allowable uses of the special land and
18 development fund and the portion of transient
19 accommodations tax collections that are allocated to
20 the special land and development fund.

16 resources, including native forests, native plants and
17 animals, aquatic resources, coastal lands, and
18 freshwater resources;
19 (2) Increase the resilience of structures and
20 infrastructure to natural and climate-related
21 disasters, such as hurricanes and sea level rise, and

2 State that charges a fee for and provides cruise ship cabins to
3 transients.

6 2. By amending the definition of "gross rental" or "gross
7 rental proceeds" to read:
8 "Gross rental" or "gross rental proceeds" means the gross
9 receipts, cash or accrued, of the taxpayer received as
10 compensation for the furnishing of transient accommodations or
11 entering into arrangements to furnish transient accommodations
12 and the value proceeding or accruing from the furnishing of

7 The words "gross rental" or "gross rental proceeds" shall

16 arrangements made by a transient accommodations broker, travel
17 agency, or tour packager at noncommissionable negotiated
18 contract rates and the gross income is divided between the
19 operator of transient accommodations on the one hand and the

A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that Hawaii is
2 experiencing a climate emergency. The effects of climate
3 change, such as rising temperatures, prolonged droughts, and
4 increasingly destructive and deadly weather events, are felt
5 across the island chain. These impacts threaten not only our
6 vibrant ecosystems but also the people of Hawaii and the State's
7 economic sustainability. To ensure the health and safety of
8 Hawaii's lands, waters, and people, as well as its economic
9 viability, successful mitigation of and adaptation to climate
10 change are imperative.
11 The legislature further finds that economic development
12 cannot be separated from environmental stewardship. Hawaii's
13 economy is deeply reliant on its natural resources, from tourism
14 and agriculture to marine industries and renewable energy.
15 Degradation of these resources due to climate change and
16 environmental mismanagement will result in significant financial
17 losses across multiple sectors. By investing in sustainability,

C.D. 2
1 the State secures long-term economic stability while preserving
2 its unique landscapes and biodiversity.
3 The legislature also finds that climate resilience must be
4 integrated into all economic planning efforts. Resiliency
5 measures, such as sustainable land use practices, shoreline
6 protection, and forestry projects, ensure that Hawaii’s economy
7 remains robust in the face of climate-related disasters.
8 Without proactive investment, businesses and communities will
9 continue to suffer financial losses due to increased flooding,
10 wildfires, and extreme weather events.
11 The legislature additionally finds that investing in
12 Hawaii's environment is, in itself, economic development.
13 Furthermore, the legislature finds that as contemplated, the
14 transient accommodations tax is intended to be applied fully and
15 equitably whenever a transient accommodation is furnished within
16 the State. Whereas hotel and lodging establishments have
17 complied with and pay their due share of transient
18 accommodations taxes, tax collections on short-term rental
19 operators have fallen short. Moreover, there is currently no
20 transient accommodations tax levied on cruise ships, which in
21 2024, accounted for 972,820 passenger port calls at port

1 facilities under the jurisdiction of the department of
2 transportation. Supporting sustainable practices protects the
3 islands' unique ecosystems while simultaneously fostering
4 economic growth. This support includes funding renewable energy
5 projects, enhancing conservation efforts, and promoting
6 environmental tourism initiatives. These investments preserve
7 natural resources, reduce carbon footprints, and stimulate
8 economic opportunities, such as job creation in renewable energy
9 sectors and eco-friendly tourism.
10 In addition, the legislature finds that Hawaii has an
11 opportunity to be a global leader in sustainable innovation. By
12 investing in conservation-focused business models, the State can
13 attract investors and industries that prioritize sustainability.
14 These initiatives not only protect the environment but also
15 diversify the economy, reducing reliance on tourism and
16 traditional extractive industries.
17 The legislature further finds that Hawaii's cultural
18 heritage and traditions are deeply connected to its natural
19 environment. The protection and restoration of forests, coral
20 reefs, and coastal ecosystems safeguard the foundation of Native
21 Hawaiian practices and knowledge systems. Investing in

1 environmental conservation ensures that these traditions can
2 continue to thrive, enriching community well-being and cultural
3 tourism.
4 The legislature also finds that a failure to act now will
5 result in increased costs in the future. The economic burden of
6 climate inaction will far exceed the cost of proactive
7 investment in mitigation and adaptation strategies.
8 Infrastructure damage, loss of biodiversity, increased health
9 issues due to heat and pollution, and disruptions to tourism and
10 agriculture will place a heavy financial strain on the State if
11 environmental action is delayed.
12 The legislature additionally finds that a strong commitment
13 to environmental sustainability enhances Hawaii's reputation as
14 a world-class destination for ecotourism. Travelers are
15 increasingly seeking destinations that prioritize
16 sustainability, and by investing in conservation efforts,
17 renewable energy, and sustainable tourism practices, Hawaii can
18 maintain its competitive edge in the global tourism market while
19 ensuring the long-term viability of its natural resources.
20 The legislature therefore declares that investment in
21 climate resilience and environmental sustainability is a

1 fundamental component of Hawaii's economic development strategy.
2 By prioritizing policies and funding mechanisms that support
3 climate action, conservation, and sustainable industries, Hawaii
4 can build a more resilient, prosperous, and environmentally
5 secure future for all residents and visitors.
6 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
7 (1) Increase the transient accommodations tax rate for
8 transient accommodations and resort time shares;
9 (2) Assess the transient accommodations tax on the gross
10 receipts derived from cruise fares;
11 (3) Require the governor to request in the executive
12 budget or supplemental budget that an amount of
13 general funds that approximates the additional
14 transient accommodations tax revenue generated by this
15 Act be expended equally to advance certain climate
16 change mitigation and tourism projects; and
17 (4) 7\mend the allowable uses of the special land and
18 development fund and the portion of transient
19 accommodations tax collections that are allocated to
20 the special land and development fund.

11 and section 237D-2(e) beginning on July 1, 2026, and by
12 assessment of the transient accommodations tax on gross rental
13 proceeds derived from cruise fares pursuant to section 237D-2(a)

16 resources, including native forests, native plants and
17 animals, aquatic resources, coastal lands, and
18 freshwater resources;

2 State that charges a fee for and provides cruise ship cabins to
3 transients.
4 "Cruise ship cabin" means an accommodation or living
5 quarter on a cruise ship that is provided to a transient."
6 2. By amending the definition of "gross rental" or "gross
7 rental proceeds" to read:
8 "Gross rental" or "gross rental proceeds" means the gross
9 receipts, cash or accrued, of the taxpayer received as
10 compensation for the furnishing of transient accommodations or
11 entering into arrangements to furnish transient accommodations
12 and the value proceeding or accruing from the furnishing of
13 transient accommodations or entering into arrangements to
14 furnish transient accommodations, including resort fees without
15 any deductions on account of the cost of property or services
16 sold, the cost of materials used, labor cost, taxes, royalties,
17 interest, discounts, or any other expenses whatsoever. "Gross

1 dealing on an accrual basis and the taxpayer's books are so
2 kept, or unless the taxpayer employs or is required to employ
3 the accrual basis for the purposes of the tax imposed by
4 chapter 237 for any taxable year in which event the taxpayer
5 shall report the taxpayer's gross income for the purposes of
6 this chapter on the accrual basis for the same period.
7 The words "gross rental" or "gross rental proceeds" shall
8 not be construed to include the amounts of taxes imposed by
9 chapter 237 or this chapter on operators of transient
10 accommodations, transient accommodations brokers, travel
11 agencies, and tour packagers and passed on, collected, and
12 received from the consumer as part of the receipts received as
13 compensation for the furnishing of transient accommodations or
14 entering into arrangements to furnish transient accommodations.
15 Where transient accommodations are furnished through
16 arrangements made by a transient accommodations broker, travel
17 agency, or tour packager at noncommissionable negotiated
18 contract rates and the gross income is divided between the
19 operator of transient accommodations on the one hand and the
20 transient accommodations broker, travel agency, or tour packager
21 on the other hand, the tax imposed by this chapter shall apply

5 maintains a schedule of rates for identifiable groups of
6 individuals, such as kamaainas, upon which the accommodations
7 are leased, let, or rented, gross rental or gross rental
8 proceeds means the receipts collected and received based upon
9 the scheduled rates and recorded as receipts in its books and
