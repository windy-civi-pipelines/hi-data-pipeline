Section 1:
HB1320 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1320 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to education. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that greater transparency is needed regarding graduate outcomes in higher education.  Publicly reporting data on educational institutions' post‑graduation employment rates, median incomes, and other metrics will allow students and their families to make informed decisions about the student's career path and which educational institution the student will attend.  Tracking and reporting this data will also help ensure institutional accountability and align higher education programs with the State's workforce development needs. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Require the university of Hawaii system to collect, analyze, and publicly report certain data on graduate outcomes; (2)  Require and appropriate moneys for the development and maintenance of a graduate outcomes dashboard; and (3)  Appropriate moneys for the establishment of two full-time equivalent (2.0 FTE) positions with the university of Hawaii system's office of the vice president for academic strategy to support this work. The legislature declares that the purpose of this Act is a matter of statewide concern. SECTION 2.  Chapter 304A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding three new sections to part I, subpart A, to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§304A-     Graduate outcomes; data collection and reporting requirements.  (a) The university of Hawaii system shall collect and publish data on the outcomes of its graduates within one year, three years, and five years of the student's graduation. (b) Data sources for graduate outcomes may include: (1)  State workforce agency employment records; (2)  Graduate surveys; (3)  Federal databases, including the United States Census Bureau's post-secondary employment outcomes program; and (4)  Employer-reported data, where applicable.

SECTION 4.  The university of Hawaii system shall begin collecting data as required by this Act no later than one year after the effective date of this Act; provided that the graduate outcomes dashboard shall be made publicly available no later than two years after the effective date of this Act.
