Section 1:
HB1320 SD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1320 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII S.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO EDUCATION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that greater transparency is needed regarding graduate outcomes in higher education.  Publicly reporting data on educational institutions' post‑graduation employment rates, median incomes, and other metrics will allow students and their families to make informed decisions about the student's career path and which educational institution the student will attend.  Tracking and reporting this data will also help ensure institutional accountability and align higher education programs with the State's workforce development needs. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Require the university of Hawaii system to collect, analyze, and publicly report certain data on graduate outcomes; (2)  Require and appropriate funds for the development and maintenance of a graduate outcomes dashboard; and (3)  Appropriate funds for the establishment of positions with the university of Hawaii system's office of the vice president for academic strategy to support this work. The legislature declares that the purpose of this Act is a matter of statewide concern pursuant to article X, section 6, of the Hawaii State Constitution.
