HB1177 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1177 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to transportation. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the geographic layout of the Hawaiian islands creates unique logistical challenges for transporting goods between the islands.  Hawaii's residents and businesses face significant challenges due to the high costs of inter-island shipping, which stem from logistical complexities, limited competition, and reliance on maritime transport.  These costs disproportionately impact neighbor island communities, leading to inflated prices for everyday essentials and hindering economic parity across the State. The legislature further finds that eliminating interisland transport costs for certain goods will foster economic benefits, including reducing the cost of living, supporting local businesses, and enhancing the competitiveness of Hawaii's industries.  Affordable transportation of goods will stimulate trade, improve access to essential resources, and promote equitable economic growth across all islands. Accordingly, the purpose of the Act is to: (1)  Extend the increase of the rental motor vehicle surcharge by $0.50 each year from December 31, 2027, to December 31, 2031; (2)  Require the department of transportation to establish a five-year interisland transportation fee reimbursement pilot program, to be funded by revenues received from the rental motor vehicle surcharge; and (3)  Appropriate funds. SECTION 2.  Section 248-9, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows: "(a)  Moneys in the state highway fund may be expended for the following purposes: (1)  To pay the costs of operation, maintenance, and repair of the state highway system, including without limitation, the cost of equipment and general administrative overhead; (2)  To pay the costs of acquisition, including real property and interests therein; planning; designing; construction; and reconstruction of the state highway system and bikeways, including without limitation, the cost of equipment and general administrative overhead; (3)  To reimburse the general fund for interest on and principal of general obligation bonds issued to finance highway projects where the bonds are designated to be reimbursable out of the state highway fund; (4)  To pay the costs of construction, maintenance, and repair of county roads; provided that none of the funds expended on a county road or program shall be federal funds when expenditure would cause a violation of federal law or a federal grant agreement; [and] (5)  To pay the costs of establishing and maintaining a drug and alcohol toxicology testing laboratory that is intended to support the prosecution of offenses relating to operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant[.]; (6)  To reimburse designated carriers under the interisland transportation fee reimbursement pilot program pursuant to Act    , Session Laws of Hawaii 2025, using revenues deposited from the rental motor vehicle surcharge pursuant to section 251-5." SECTION 3.  Section 251-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows: "(a)  There is levied and shall be assessed and collected each month a rental motor vehicle surcharge tax of $5 a day, or any portion of a day that a rental motor vehicle is rented or leased.  Beginning January 1, 2022, and each subsequent year on January 1 until December 31, [2027,] 2031, the rental motor vehicle surcharge tax shall increase by $0.50.  The rental motor vehicle surcharge tax shall be levied upon the lessor; provided that the tax shall not be levied on the lessor if: (1)  The lessor is renting the vehicle to replace a vehicle of the lessee that: (A)  Is being repaired; or (B)  Has been stolen and is unrecovered or will not be repaired due to a total loss of the vehicle; and (2)  A record of the repair order, the stolen vehicle record, or total loss vehicle claim for the vehicle is retained either by the lessor for two years for verification purposes or by a motor vehicle repair dealer for two years as provided in section 437B-16.
