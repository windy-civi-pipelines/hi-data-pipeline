STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 2
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO PARKING.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the statewide
2 parking program for persons with disabilities was established to
3 issue disability parking permits to applicants who are certified
4 by a physician or advance practice registered nurse. A vehicle
5 displaying a disability parking permit is authorized to park in
6 spaces designed and reserved for persons with mobility
7 disabilities. However, improper use and insufficient
8 enforcement impact access for legitimate program participants.
9 The legislature further finds that adoption of electric
10 vehicles is a vital step in the State's efforts to combat
11 climate change, reach the 2045 mandated carbon neutrality, and
12 create a more sustainable future. The legislature has made
13 efforts to encourage and facilitate the adoption of electric
14 vehicles with tax credits and designated charging parking
15 spaces. These parking spaces not only encourage the adoption of
16 electric vehicles but are a vital component to personal and
17 statewide use. The ability to park in an electric vehicle space

CD. 1
1 allows individuals to make sure they can continue to use their
2 vehicle with ease and have the security to make it to their next
3 destination with adequate fuel. The use of these spaces by
4 non-electric vehicles not only takes away an incentive granted
5 to electric vehicle drivers, but can imperil their
6 transportation use by not allowing them the opportunity to
7 recharge.
8 Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to:
9 (1) Establish a state reserved parking space enforcement
10 fine for the unauthorized use of parking spaces
11 reserved for persons with disabilities or electric
12 vehicles;
13 (2) Specify that a fine shall not be imposed on a person
14 who parks in a parking space reserved for electric
15 vehicles if the charging system is inoperable or
16 broken; and
17 (3) Require fifty per cent of the fines be deposited into
18 the safe routes to school program special fund and
19 fifty per cent of the fines be deposited into the
20 general fund.
