HB747 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 747 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to human remains. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that natural organic reduction or "human composting" is a process in which human remains are turned into soil.  The legislature further finds that natural organic reduction is more environmentally friendly than traditional burial and cremation processes as it utilizes less energy and does not rely on fossil fuels.  The legislature also finds that California, Colorado, and Washington, amongst other states, have legalized this practice. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to allow for the use of natural organic reduction in the treatment and disposal of human remains. SECTION 2.  Section 327-32, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§327-32  Administration; duties of health officers.  Every head officer of a hospital, nursing home, correctional facility, funeral parlor, or mortuary and every county medical examiner or coroner and every state or county officer, and every other person who has possession, charge, or control of any unclaimed dead human body that may undergo cremation or natural organic reduction as defined in section 531B-2 at public expense pursuant to section 346-15 shall: (1)  Exercise due diligence to notify the relatives and friends of the decedent, any representative of a fraternal society of which the deceased was a member, and any legally responsible party; and (2)  Submit in writing to the department of human services a description of the efforts used in making the determination that the dead human body is unclaimed in accordance with section 346-15, if payment for cremation is sought. Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the requirements relating to the filing of a certificate of death with the department of health pursuant to chapter 338." SECTION 3.  Section 327-36, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§327-36  Final disposition of anatomical gifts.  A person or procurement organization that holds a dead human body as a result of an anatomical gift shall, when the body is deemed of no further value for purposes of transplantation, therapy, research, or education, be responsible for the final disposition of that dead human body and all of its parts, except those parts used for transplantation.  The person or procurement organization shall dispose of the remains by cremation or natural organic reduction as defined in section 531B-2, except as otherwise provided in section 327-14 or as directed in a document of gift, subject to any required disposition permits." SECTION 4.  Chapter 327N, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending its title to read as follows: "[[]CHAPTER 327N[]] HYDROLYSIS FACILITIES; NATURAL ORGANIC REDUCTION FACILITIES" SECTION 5.  Section 327N-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new definition to be appropriately inserted and to read as follows: ""Natural organic reduction facility" has the same meaning as in 531B-2." SECTION 6.  Section 327N-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "[[]§327N-2[]]  Hydrolysis facilities and natural organic reduction facilities operating as mortuaries or funeral establishments; human remains.  Any commercial hydrolysis facility or natural organic reduction facility in the State handling human remains shall be subject to the requirements for funeral establishments and mortuaries." SECTION 7.  Section 346-15, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended as follows: 1.  By amending subsection (b) to read: "(b)  All unclaimed dead human bodies shall undergo cremation or natural organic reduction as defined in section 531B-2.  The department may bear the cost of the mortuary, crematory, [or] hydrolysis facility, or natural organic reduction facility services for unclaimed dead human bodies furnished by any licensed provider of these services. Payments for these services shall be made to the extent of the cost, or in the sum of $800 in total, whichever is less, for each unclaimed dead human body.  Individuals who have possession, charge, or control of any unclaimed dead human body to undergo cremation or natural organic reduction at public expense shall have sixty days from the date of the deceased's death to submit in writing to the department its determination that the dead human body is unclaimed and its application for payment for cremation.  The county medical examiners or coroners shall have no time limitation by which to submit their written determination that the dead human body is unclaimed and their application for payment for cremation." 2. By amending subsection (e) to read: "(e)  For the purposes of this section, "unclaimed dead human body" means the remains of any deceased person for whom no one has assumed responsibility for disposition and no legally responsible individual has been identified. Pursuant to section 327-32, the department shall review the written description of the efforts used in making the determination that a dead human body is unclaimed and approve the determination for purposes of payment of the mortuary, crematory, [or] hydrolysis facility, or natural organic reduction facility services, if it meets the department's requirements." SECTION 8.  Section 531B-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding two new definitions to be appropriately inserted and to read as follows: ""Natural organic reduction" means the contained, accelerated conversion of human remains to soil.

SECTION 10.  Section 531B-7, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsections (b) and (c) to read as follows: "(b)  The following provisions shall apply to the court's determination under this section: (1)  If two or more persons with the same priority class hold the right of disposition and cannot agree by majority vote regarding the disposition of the decedent's remains, or there are any persons who claim to have priority over any other person, any of these persons or a funeral establishment, cemetery, mortuary, crematory, [or] hydrolysis facility, or natural organic reduction facility with custody of the remains may file a petition asking the probate court to make a determination in the matter; and (2)  In making a determination in a case where there are two or more persons with the same priority class who cannot agree by majority vote, the probate court may consider the following: (A)  The reasonableness and practicality of the proposed funeral arrangements and disposition; (B)  The degree of the personal relationship between the decedent and each of the persons claiming the right of disposition; (C)  The desires of the person or persons who are ready, able, and willing to pay the cost of the funeral arrangements and disposition; (D)  The convenience and needs of other families and friends wishing to pay respects; (E)  The desires of the decedent; and (F)  The degree to which the funeral arrangements would allow maximum participation by all wishing to pay respect.

This section shall not be construed to require or impose a duty upon a funeral establishment, cemetery, mortuary, crematory, [or] hydrolysis facility, or natural organic reduction facility to bring an action under this section. A funeral establishment, cemetery, mortuary, crematory, [or] hydrolysis facility, or natural organic reduction facility and its officers, directors, managers, members, partners, or employees may not be held criminally or civilly liable for choosing not to bring an action under this section."
