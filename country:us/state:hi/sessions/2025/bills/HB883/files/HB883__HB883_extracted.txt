HB883 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 883 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to emergency management. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that despite Hawaii's increasing risk of experiencing extreme weather events, information consolidation and sharing is lacking as it relates to locations where the public can shelter at a moment's notice. In addition, few public buildings meet minimum requirements for hurricane sheltering while demand for public evacuation shelter space is likely to exceed available inventory. The legislature finds it is critical to take a more focused approach towards shelter retrofitting and strengthen communication of available shelters amongst government entities and the general public. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Require the Hawaii emergency management agency to inventory all designated emergency shelters statewide and their ability to withstand a category one hurricane or higher; (2)  Collaborate with the counties to publish a publicly available list of shelters and their respective hurricane rating; and (3)  Provide funding for the hurricane shelter retrofit program and establish a director position to manage its activities. SECTION 2.  Section 127A-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§127A-3  Hawaii emergency management agency.  (a) There is established within the department of defense the Hawaii emergency management agency.  The adjutant general shall serve as the director of Hawaii emergency management and, subject to the direction and control of the governor, shall oversee the agency.

(c)  The administrator may, from funds allotted therefor, employ technical, clerical, administrative, and other personnel and make such expenditures as may be necessary. (d)  The administrator shall coordinate the activities of the agency with all county emergency management agencies, other state agencies, other states, or federal agencies involved in emergency management activities, and all organizations for emergency management within the State, whether public or private, and shall maintain liaison and cooperate with all county emergency management agencies, other state agencies, other states, or federal agencies involved in emergency management activities as provided in this chapter.
