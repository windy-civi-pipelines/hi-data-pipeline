BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that effective and efficient water resource management requires continuous and experienced leadership, especially given the climate crisis and the urgent necessity to properly steward water resources to meet the affordable housing needs of local residents. On December 28, 1994, the review commission on the state water code submitted its final report to the legislature pursuant to Act 45, Session Laws of Hawaii 1987. The review commission determined that amendments to the state water code were necessary to enable the commission on water resource management to more effectively carry out its mandate pursuant to article XI, section 7, of the Hawaii State Constitution to "set overall water conservation, quality and use policies; define beneficial and reasonable uses; protect ground and surface water resources, watersheds and natural stream environments; establish criteria for water use priorities while assuring appurtenant rights and existing correlative and riparian uses and establish procedures for regulating all uses of Hawaii's water resources." Therefore, further clarification of the commission on water resource management's purpose, including its leadership structure and composition of the commission's board, will provide greater accountability and protection of the State's waters.

SECTION 2.  Chapter 174C, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part IV to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§174C- Public trust purpose.  The commission shall act upon water use permit applications, filed in accordance with sections 174C-51, 174C-52, and 174C-53, for both existing and new public trust purposes before acting upon water use permit applications for other existing or new uses, or both, filed in accordance with sections 174C-51, 174C-52, and 174C-53.  Proceedings for applications for public trust purposes shall be held first and separate from proceedings for all other applications filed in accordance with sections 174C-51, 174C-52, and 174C-53."
