STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO POSITIONS AT THE JOHN A. BURNS SCHOOL OF MEDICINE.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the basic mission of
2 the university of Hawaii John A. Burns school of medicine
3 (JABSOM) is to teach and train high-quality physicians,
4 biomedical scientists, and allied health workers for Hawaii and
5 the Pacific. JABSOM's major purpose is to provide an
6 opportunity for a medical education previously unavailable to
7 residents of Hawaii and other Pacific nations. JABSOM is
8 committed to educating current and future health care
9 professionals and leaders, delivering high-quality health care,
10 and conducting research and translating discoveries into
11 practice in Hawaii and the Asia-Pacific region.
12 The legislature further finds that additional faculty
13 positions in cardiovascular biology, tropical medicine, and
14 quantitative health biostatistics will strengthen JABSOM's
15 biomedical and health disparities translational "bench to
16 bedside" research strategy. This directly benefits the Hawaii
17 and Asia-Pacific regions' ecological and human health by
2025-3406 HB718 GDI HMSO

C.D. 1
1 addressing linkages between cardiovascular disease and
2 treatments, environmental factors, and human health, and
3 includes biostatistical data collection and health analytics
4 focused on the people of Hawaii and the Asia-Pacific region.
5 The legislature also finds that advancement of JABSOM's
6 research mission enables the health care community to understand
7 better potential health disparities across a wide spectrum of
8 conditions and diseases commonly experienced by many in Hawaii
9 who are already at a higher risk for disease or suffer
10 disproportionately. The basic science position in
11 cardiovascular biology will help further foundational knowledge
12 that can then be used by JABSOM's clinicians, researchers in the
13 department of Native Hawaiian health, and community partners to
14 develop better risk reduction strategies or new interventions
15 that will reduce cardiovascular diseases among individuals of
16 Native Hawaiian and Pacific Island descent.
17 A senior faculty member in JABSOM's tropical medicine
18 department will advance the department's education and research
19 of globally significant infectious diseases of vital interest to
20 Hawaii and the Asia-Pacific region. The department's importance
21 in addressing diseases of far-reaching consequences became known

1 during the COVID-19 pandemic when it was vital to develop
2 diagnostics and vaccines to preserve the health of Hawaii's
3 residents efficiently and effectively, given Hawaii's remote
4 location and isolated communities.
5 Biostatisticians play a pivotal role in providing reguired
6 education to medical students, residents, and other trainees,
7 enriching the academic environment and facilitating student
8 success. Biostatisticians are also critical members of research
9 teams, especially in this era of big data sets and utilizing
10 artificial intelligence tools to perform analyses more quickly,
11 which means that the data can be used to drive policy, programs,
12 or new strategies more quickly. Together, all three faculty
13 positions enable JABSOM to further innovate and fulfill long­
14 term goals to eliminate health disparities in Hawaii and the
15 Asia-Pacific region.
16 The legislature additionally finds that the Kakaako health
17 and wellness medical school buildings opened in 2005. Since
18 opening, the Honolulu board of water supply (BWS) has provided
19 JABSOM's chilled water service operations, equipment
20 maintenance, and injection well testing, and fulfilled reporting
21 requirements. BWS' twenty-year contract will end on

1 September 15, 2025, and BWS has elected not to renew the
2 contract. JABSOM must contract a chiller plant-cooling system
3 servicer to maintain uninterrupted operations and emergency
4 services twenty-four hours a day, seven days per week for most
5 of the chiller plant deferred maintenance and data processing.
6 Additionally, a new administrative, professional, and technical
7 staff position, specifically an environmental health and safety
8 officer, is needed to perform all the required daily, quarterly,
9 semi-annual, and annual testing of the injection wells, and
10 reporting duties.
11 The purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds to the
12 university of Hawaii John A. Burns school of medicine for:
13 (1) Faculty positions in the fields of cardiovascular
14 biology, tropical medicine, and quantitative health
15 biostatistics; and
16 (2) An environmental health and safety officer staff
17 position.
18 SECTION 2. There is appropriated out of the general
19 revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $763,000 or so much
20 thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the
21 same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year
