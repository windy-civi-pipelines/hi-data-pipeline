In accordance with section 9 of article VII of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii and sections 37-91 and 37-93, Hawaii Revised Statutes, the legislature has determined that at the beginning of the regular session of 2025, the general fund expenditure ceiling for fiscal year 2024-2025 was exceeded by $8,551,795, or one per cent.  The appropriations contained in Act 1, Session Laws of Hawaii 2025, caused the general fund expenditure ceiling for fiscal year 2024-2025 to be further exceeded by an additional $30,334,159. Therefore, the general fund expenditure ceiling for fiscal year 2024-2025 has already been exceeded by $38,885,954, or one per cent.

PART V SECTION 5. The sums hereinabove may be paid to the respective persons, firms, corporations, or entities for the satisfaction or settlement of the respectively identified cases, and in several amounts hereinabove set forth or in lesser amounts deemed appropriate, upon checks issued by the comptroller; provided that departments shall obtain the approval of the attorney general before payment of any claim may be made. SECTION 6. Notwithstanding the sums hereinabove stated as interest upon judgments against the State, payment of interest shall be limited to the period from the date of the judgment, if applicable, to thirty days after the effective date of this Act, as provided in section 662-8, Hawaii Revised Statutes, for those cases to which the statute applies. SECTION 7. All unexpended and unencumbered balances of the appropriations made in this Act as of the close of business on June 30, 2026, shall lapse. SECTION 8. If any provision of this Act, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the Act that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this Act are severable. SECTION 9. This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
