Section 1:
SB809 SD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 809 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the State's existing campaign finance law prohibits companies who receive state and county contracts from making campaign contributions.  The prohibition against state and county contractors does not extend to any owners, officers, or family members of the contractor, meaning that those individuals can still make contributions to election campaigns. The legislature also finds that there are no campaign contribution prohibitions on organizations that receive grants from the State or counties.  These grantees receive public funds appropriated by a legislative body, similar to state or county contractors. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to reduce the potential for donations to unduly influence policy-making and to improve actual and perceived standards of conduct by expanding the prohibition against contributions to candidate and noncandidate committees to include contributions from state and county grantees and the officers and immediate family members of a state or county contractor or grantee. SECTION 2.  Section 11-355, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "[[]§11-355[]] Contributions [by state and county contractors]; state or county contractors; state or county grantees; officers and immediate family members of state or county contractors or grantees; prohibited.  (a)  It shall be unlawful for any person who enters into any contract with the State, any of the counties, or any department or agency thereof either for the rendition of personal services, the buying of property, or furnishing of any material, supplies, or equipment to the State, any of the counties, any department or agency thereof, or for selling any land or building to the State, any of the counties, or any department or agency thereof, if payment for the performance of the contract or payment for material, supplies, equipment, land, property, or building is to be made in whole or in part from funds appropriated by the legislative body, at any time between the execution of the contract through the completion of the contract, to: (1)  Directly or indirectly make any contribution, or promise expressly or impliedly to make any contribution to any candidate committee or noncandidate committee, or to any candidate or to any person for any political purpose or use; or (2)  Knowingly solicit any contribution from any person for any purpose during any period. (b) It shall be unlawful for the owners, officers, and any immediate family member of any state or county contractor under subsection (a), at any time between the execution of the contract through the completion of the contract pursuant to subsection (a), to directly or indirectly make any contribution to any candidate committee or noncandidate committee. (c)  It shall be unlawful for any person who receives a grant or subsidy from the State pursuant to chapter 42F, or from a county pursuant to a county charter or code, at any time between the execution of the contract through the completion of the contract for the grant or subsidy to: (1)  Directly or indirectly make any contribution, or promise expressly or impliedly to make any contribution to any candidate committee or noncandidate committee, or to any candidate or to any person for any political purpose or use; or (2)  Knowingly solicit any contribution from any person for any purpose during any period.

[(b)] (g)  Except as provided in [subsection] subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d), this section does not prohibit or make unlawful the establishment or administration of, or the solicitation of contributions to, any noncandidate committee by any person other than the state or county contractor, the state or county grantee, or the owners, officers, and immediate family members of a state or county contractor or grantee, for the purpose of influencing the nomination for election, or the election of any person to office.
