Section 1:
HB1115 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1115 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO UNIVERSAL IMMUNIZATION FUNDING PROGRAM. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that fourteen states have adopted programs known as "Universal Purchase" or "Universal Select" (collectively, UP), providing state-purchased access to some or all recommended immunizations to children and adults in those states.  UP immunization purchases occur at a discounted price through contracts otherwise intended for more established and familiar immunization purchasing programs such as the Vaccines For Children Program (Pub. L. 103-66) and Public Health Services Act, Section 317 Immunization Program (Pub. L. 78-410).  Other varied state approaches include superseding private sources of coverage and assessing health insurance plans for the cost of the program and disallowing provider use of private immunization stock. The legislature further finds that states with UP programs that allow state health officials to manage the supply of immunizations lowered health care providers' administrative costs and ensured that the states can quickly supply immunizations to vulnerable patient groups during emergencies or immunization shortages.  The potential benefits to Hawaii's health care and public health system make investment in a UP program worthwhile. SECTION 2. Chapter 321, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "PART    . UNIVERSAL IMMUNIZATION FUNDING PROGRAM §321-     Definitions.  As used in this part, unless  the context otherwise requires: "Adult covered lives" means all adults under the age of sixty-five who have immunizations covered: (1)  By an individual health insurance policy issued or delivered in the State; (2)  By a group health insurance policy issued or delivered in the State; (3)  By a group health insurance policy evidenced by a certificate of insurance issued or delivered to an individual residing in the State; (4)  By an employee benefit plan of a self-insured entity or a government plan for any employer or government entity that has an office or other worksite located in the State or has two or more employees; or (5)  As a participant or beneficiary of a health cost sharing program.

"Immunization" means any preparation of killed microorganisms, living attenuated organisms, or living fully virulent organisms of mRNA or any other injectable treatment intended to trigger an immune response that is authorized by the United States Food and Drug Administration and recommended by the national Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and has been authorized for purchase by the director for the purposes of producing or artificially increasing immunity to particular diseases.  For purposes of this part, "immunization" shall include any other substance designated as such by order of the director. "Provider" means a person licensed by the State to administer immunizations or provide health care services or a partnership or corporation or other entity made up of those persons. §321-     Universal immunization purchase special fund; established.  (a)  There is established in the state treasury the universal immunization purchase special fund into which shall be deposited fees, fines, and cost reimbursements paid by assessed entities.  The fund shall be administered and expended by the department.

(b)  No later than forty-five days following the close of the state fiscal year, the department shall provide an accounting of immunization purchase funds not covered by any state or other program to determine the final amount needed to cover the prior fiscal year. Unless determined by the director, any assessed entity that would otherwise be responsible for reimbursement to any provider for any immunization administration shall be responsible for reporting the child covered life and adult covered life and for payment of the corresponding assessment to the department. (c)  At any time after one full calendar year of operation under subsections (a) and (b), the director may make changes to the assessment collection mechanism.  Any such changes shall be reflected in an updated plan of operation available to the public.
