Section 1:
SB409 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 409 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to the department of education. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that ultraviolet (UV) rays present in sunlight pose a threat to the wellbeing of Hawaii's people.  Long-term exposure to UV rays play a significant role in the development of sunburns, skin aging, and skin cancers, including malignant melanoma.  Providing protection from direct sunlight by installing shading over playgrounds would protect Hawaii's keiki and thereby benefit the overall public health of the State's residents.

Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds to the department of education for the design and construction of photovoltaic panels over all playgrounds on department of education schools. SECTION 2. There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the design and construction of photovoltaic panels over all playgrounds on department of education schools.
