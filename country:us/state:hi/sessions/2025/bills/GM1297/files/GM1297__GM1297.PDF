STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO RED HILL.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAH:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the United States
2 Navy’s Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility consists of twenty
3 steel-lined underground storage tanks that were built from 1940
4 to 1943. Each tank can store 12.5 million gallons of fuel; in
5 total, the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility can store up to
6 two hundred fifty million gallons. The tanks are located only
7 about one hundred feet above the United States Environmental
8 Protection Agency's designated sole-source groundwater aquifer
9 that provides drinking water to approximately four hundred
10 thousand residents of the island of Oahu. Over the past eighty
11 years, numerous spills have occurred at Red Hill. Specifically,
12 on November 20, 2021, about ninety-three thousand individuals
13 served by the United States Navy's potable water system for
14 Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam were directly affected when the
15 United States Navy’s Red Hill shaft was contaminated by the
16 release of up to nineteen thousand gallons of fuel, including
17 JP-5 jet fuel, older fuels stored at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel

1 Storage Facility, and any additives used. Over six thousand
2 individuals sought medical attention, and one thousand were
3 forced to leave their homes due to the contamination. Much of
4 the fuel released from the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility
5 remains in the environment, trapped within the complex
6 geological formations beneath and near the tanks.
7 The legislature further finds that on May 9, 2023,
8 officials from the State and city and county of Honolulu signed
9 a unified statement on Red Hill, recognizing the stewardship
10 responsibility to ensure that there is clean water on Oahu for
11 future generations. The Red Hill Water Alliance Initiative
12 (WAI), a working group, met regularly in 2023 after the signing
13 of the unified statement. The Red Hill WAI posed questions,
14 conducted research, listened to subject-matter experts, and
15 formulated recommended policies.
16 The legislature also finds that the Red Hill WAI's approach
17 of total stewardship responsibility required a stance of
18 extending beyond statutory roles, specific responsibilities,
19 tenure in those roles, and even personal lifetimes. Its inquiry
20 included the pursuit of critical questions for which there may

1 currently be no answers. Thus, the pursuit of those answers is
2 part of the ongoing work.
3 The legislature notes that besides its regulatory functions
4 under federal and state environmental laws, the State also has
5 unique public trust responsibilities set forth in the Hawaii
6 State Constitution, which establishes an affirmative duty of the
7 State to preserve and protect public trust resources, including
8 water resources.
9 The legislature additionally finds that the focus of the
10 Red Hill WAI’s inquiry is the remediation needs after the
11 defueling of the tanks and removal of residual fuel and
12 contaminants from the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility. In
13 particular, the Red Hill WAI is concerned with the unknowns
14 posed by fuel contaminants already in the ground, as well as the
15 residuals of the fuel plume in the aquifer as a result of the
16 spill that occurred on November 20, 2021. In fact, there may be
17 as many as 1,940,000 gallons of fuel constituents in the ground
18 that have leaked or spilled over eight decades. Pursuant to a
19 proactive approach, the Red Hill WAI seeks to describe the
20 remediation it believes necessary for the future well-being of
21 the aquifer in which there is a negligible risk to current and

1 future water sources, including the Halawa Shaft, Halawa wells,
2 and Aiea wells; the water distribution system; and the
3 ecosystem, including springs, streams, and nearshore waters.
4 After much diligent work, the Red Hill WAI issued a public
5 report in November 2023 that set forth its findings and
6 recommendations. Some of the recommendations can only be
7 addressed by the federal government, while other recommendations
8 can be undertaken by the State and city and county of Honolulu.
9 Moreover, the legislature finds that there must be no delay in
10 adopting the recommendations of the Red Hill WAI, especially
11 those that can be implemented at the state and county levels.
12 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish:
13 (1) A Red Hill Water Alliance Initiative (WAI) policy
14 coordinator to coordinate WAI initiatives across state
15 and county agencies and appropriate federal entities;
16 and
17 (2) The Red Hill remediation special fund.
18 SECTION 2. The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by
19 adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read
20 as follows:
