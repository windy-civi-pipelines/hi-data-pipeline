Section 1:
SB1231 HD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1231 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO PARENTAGE. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the State's existing parentage laws need to be updated to include current concepts of families, parenthood, conception, gestation, and parental rights.  The legislature further finds that the Uniform Parentage Act of 2017, among other things, ensures the equal treatment of children born to same-gender couples, adds an additional status of functional parent as a legal parent, and includes provisions that reflect developments in surrogacy and assisted reproductive technology. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to adopt portions of the Uniform Parentage Act of 2017 to update existing law. SECTION 2.  The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Chapter uniform parentage act Part i. General provisions §   -101  Short title.  This chapter may be cited as the Uniform Parentage Act. §   -102  Definitions.  As used in this chapter: "Acknowledged parent" means an individual who has established a parent-child relationship under part IV. "Adjudicated parent" means an individual who has been adjudicated to be a parent of a child by a court with jurisdiction. "Alleged genetic parent" means an individual who is alleged to be, or alleges that the individual is, a genetic parent or possible genetic parent of a child whose parentage has not been adjudicated.  "Alleged genetic parent" does not include a presumed parent; an individual whose parental rights have been terminated or declared not to exist; or a donor. "Assisted reproduction" means a method of causing pregnancy other than sexual intercourse.  "Assisted reproduction" includes intrauterine or intracervical insemination, donation of gametes, donation of embryos, in vitro fertilization and transfer of embryos, and intracytoplasmic sperm injection. "Birth" includes but is not limited to stillbirth. "Birthing center" means any facility, other than a hospital or facility associated with a hospital, that provides maternity services.

"Embryo" means the fertilized product of a sperm and egg, including the zygote stage of early embryo development after fertilization. "Ethnic or racial group" means for the purpose of genetic testing, a recognized group that an individual identifies as the individual's ancestry or part of the individual's ancestry or that is identified by other information. "Fertility clinic" means a medical facility that specializes in diagnosing and treating infertility and the use of assisted reproductive technology. "Functional parent" means an individual who meets the criteria set out in section -603(d). "Gamete" means sperm, egg, or any part of a sperm or egg. "Genetic parent" means an individual whose relationship to a child has been determined by genetic testing or based on a statement by the physician who oversaw the in vitro process by which the embryo was created and transferred.

"Presumed parent" means an individual who under section    -303 is presumed to be a parent of a child, unless the presumption is overcome in a judicial proceeding, a valid denial of parentage is made under part VI, or a court adjudicates the individual to be a parent. "Probability of parentage" means, for the ethnic or racial group to which an individual alleged to be a parent belongs, the probability that a hypothesized genetic relationship is supported, compared to the probability that a genetic relationship is supported between the child and a random individual of the ethnic or racial group used in the hypothesized genetic relationship, expressed as a percentage incorporating the combined relationship index and a prior probability. "Record" means information that is written or printed, or that is stored in an electronic or other medium and is retrievable in a perceivable form.

PART II. JURISDICTION §   -201  Jurisdiction; venue.  (a)  Without limiting the jurisdiction of any other court, the family court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought under this chapter, chapter 576B, or chapter 583A.  The action may be joined with an action for divorce, annulment, separate maintenance, or support. (b)  An individual who has sexual intercourse, undergoes or consents to assisted reproductive technology, or consents to an assisted reproductive or surrogacy technology agreement in this State thereby submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of this State as to an action brought under this chapter with respect to a child who may have been conceived by that act of intercourse or assisted reproductive technology, regardless of where the child is born.  A court of this State with jurisdiction to adjudicate parentage may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident individual, or a guardian or conservator of the individual, if the conditions prescribed in section 576B-201 are satisfied.  In addition to any other method provided by statute, personal jurisdiction over a resident and nonresident individual may be acquired by personal service within or outside this State or by service by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, with return receipt requested. (c)  In addition to any other method of service provided by statute or court rule, if the respondent is not found within the circuit, service may be effectuated by certified or registered mail, with request for a return receipt and direction to deliver to addressee only.  The return receipt signed by the respondent shall be prima facie evidence that the respondent accepted delivery of the complaint and summons on the date set forth on the receipt.  For service effectuated by certified or registered mail, an electronic copy or facsimile of the signature of the served individual or certified mailers provided by the United States Postal Service shall constitute valid proof of service on the individual.  Actual receipt by the respondent of the complaint and summons sent by certified or registered mail shall be the equivalent to personal service on the respondent by an authorized process server as of the date of the receipt. (d)  If it appears that the respondent has refused to accept service by certified or registered mail or is concealing the respondent's self or evading service, or the petitioner does not know the address or residence of the respondent and has not been able to ascertain the same after reasonable and due inquiry and search, the court may authorize notice of the parentage action and the time and date of hearing by publication or by any other manner that is reasonably calculated to give the party actual notice of proceedings and an opportunity to be heard, including the following: (1)  When publication is authorized, the summons shall be published once a week for four consecutive weeks in a publication of general circulation in the circuit.  The publication of general circulation shall be designated by the court in the order for publication of the summons.  Notice by publication shall have the same force and effect as the individual having been personally served with the summons; provided that the date of the last publication shall be set no less than twenty-one days before the return date stated in the summons.  Proof of service shall be satisfied by an affidavit or declaration by the authorized representative for the publication that the notice was given in the manner prescribed by the court; (2)  When posting to an online publication website is authorized, proof of service shall be satisfied by an affidavit or declaration by the authorized representative for the publication that the notice was given in the manner prescribed by the court; (3)  When service by electronic mail or posting to a social networking account is authorized, proof of service shall be satisfied by an affidavit or declaration by the process server that the notice was given in the manner prescribed by the court; and (4)  When service is made by posting to a public bulletin board, proof of service shall be satisfied by an affidavit or declaration by the process server that the notice was given in the manner prescribed by the court. (e)  The action may be brought in the county in which: (1)  The child, or any parent, alleged genetic parent, functional parent, or presumed parent resides or is found; (2)  The child was born; (3)  Proceedings for probate of the parent's estate have been or could be commenced, if a parent is deceased; or (4)  Assisted reproductive technology was performed, or as specified in an assisted reproduction or surrogacy agreement, if any. §   -202  Parentage determinations from other states and territories.  Parentage determinations from other states and territories, whether established through voluntary acknowledgment or through administrative or judicial processes, shall be treated the same as a parentage adjudication in this State.  A determination addressing only parentage in another state shall not preclude a court in this State from addressing other related issues. §   -203  Who may bring action; when action may be brought; process, warrant, bond.  (a)  A child or guardian ad litem of the child, an individual who is the child's parent under this chapter, an individual whose parentage of the child is to be adjudicated, a personal representative of a deceased parent of the child, a personal representative of a deceased individual who otherwise would be entitled to maintain a proceeding, or the child support enforcement agency may bring an action for the purpose of declaring the existence or nonexistence of a parent‑child relationship in accordance with the following: (1)  If the child is the subject of an adoption proceeding, an action may be brought: (A)  Within thirty days after the date of the child's birth in any case when a parent relinquishes the child for adoption during the thirty-day period; or (B)  Any time before the date of execution by a parent of a valid consent to the child's adoption, or before placement of the child with adoptive parents; (2)  If the child has not become the subject of an adoption proceeding, within three years after the child reaches the age of majority or any time after that for good cause; provided that any period of time during which the individual whose parentage is to be adjudicated is absent from the State or is openly cohabitating with a parent of the child or is contributing to the support of the child, shall not be computed; (3)  This section shall not extend the time within which a right of inheritance or a right to a succession may be asserted beyond the time otherwise provided by law relating to distribution and closing of decedents' estates or to the determination of heirship; and (4)  A personal representative for purposes of this section may be appointed by the court upon a filing of an ex parte motion by one of the parties entitled to file a parentage action.  Probate requirements need not be met.  Appointment of a personal representative in this section shall be limited to representation in proceedings under this chapter. (b)  When an action is brought under this section, process shall issue in the form of a summons and an order directed to the individual whose parentage of the child is to be adjudicated, requiring each party to appear and to show cause why the action should not be brought.  The court, in its discretion, may waive a hearing on an uncontested parentage complaint submitted by an individual who gave birth to a child, an alleged genetic parent of the child, a presumed parent of the child, or a functional parent of the child with proof provided by affidavit. If, at any stage of the proceedings, there appears probable cause to believe that the individual whose parentage of the child is to be adjudicated will fail to appear in response to the summons or will flee the jurisdiction of the court, the court may issue a warrant directed to the sheriff, deputy sheriff, or any police officer within the circuit, requiring the individual to be arrested and brought for pretrial proceedings before the family court.  Upon the pretrial proceedings, the court may require the individual to enter into bond with good sureties to the State in a sum to be fixed by the court for each individual's appearance and the trial of the proceeding in the family court.  If the individual whose parentage of the child is to be adjudicated fails to give the bond required, the court may immediately commit that individual to the custody of the chief of police of the county, there to remain until that individual enters into the required bond or otherwise is discharged by due process of law.  If the individual whose parentage of the child is to be adjudicated fails to appear in any proceeding under this chapter, any bond for that individual's appearance in any proceeding under this chapter shall be forfeited; provided that the trial of, or other proceedings in, the action shall proceed as though that individual were present, and the court shall make orders as it deems proper upon the findings as though that individual were in court. In case of forfeiture of any appearance bond, the money collected upon the forfeiture shall be applied in payment of the judgment against the individual if they are adjudicated to be a parent under this chapter. (c)  Regardless of its terms, an agreement, other than an agreement approved by the court in accordance with section   ‑502(a)(2), between a parent and the individual whose parentage of the child is to be adjudicated shall not bar an action under this section. (d)  Except as otherwise provided in section -910, if an action under this section is brought before the birth of the child, all proceedings shall be stayed until after the birth except service of process and the taking of depositions to perpetuate testimony. (e)  Subject to the requirements of section -303(a), with respect to a child who was not conceived through assisted reproduction, where a married individual has not had sexual contact with the married individual's spouse nor resided in the same house with the spouse for at least three hundred days before the birth of the child and the spouse cannot be contacted after due diligence, the court may accept an affidavit by the married individual, attesting to the married individual's diligent efforts to contact the married individual's spouse and providing clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption of the parentage of the subject child, and upon the court's satisfaction, notice of the spouse may be waived and the spouse need not be made a party in the parentage proceedings.  The court, after receiving evidence, may also enter a finding of non-parentage of the spouse. (f)  With respect to a child who was not conceived through assisted reproduction, where a married individual has not had sexual contact with the married individual's spouse nor resided in the same house with the spouse for at least three hundred days before the birth of the child, and the biological parent is known, parentage in the married spouse may be disestablished by submission of affidavits of both spouses and the biological parent stating the name and birth date of the child and acknowledgment that the spouse is not the parent and that the biological parent should be adjudicated as the legal parent. §   -204  Representation of child; action if public assistance moneys are paid; child support enforcement agency.  The child may be made a party to the action and may be represented by the child's general guardian or a guardian ad litem appointed by the court.  The child's parent shall not represent the child as guardian or otherwise.  Subject to section    ‑203, each individual presumed to be a parent under section    ‑303 and the child support enforcement agency, if public moneys are or have been paid for the support of the subject child, shall be made parties, or, if not subject to the jurisdiction of the court, shall be given notice of the action in a manner prescribed by the court and an opportunity to be heard. PART III. PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP §   -301  Establishment of parent-child relationship.  A parent-child relationship is established between an individual and a child if: (1)  The individual gives birth to the child, except as otherwise provided in part IX; (2)  There is a presumption under section -303 of the individual's parentage of the child, unless the presumption is overcome in a judicial proceeding or a valid denial of parentage is made under part VI; (3)  The individual is adjudicated as a parent of the child under part V; (4)  The individual adopts the child; (5)  The individual acknowledges parentage of the child under part IV, unless the acknowledgment is rescinded under section    -403(f) or successfully challenged under part IV or V; (6)  The individual's parentage of the child is established under part VIII; or (7)  The individual's parentage of the child is established under part IX. §   -302  Relationship not dependent on marriage.  A parent-child relationship extends equally to every child and parent, regardless of the marital status of the parent. §   -303  Presumption of parentage.  (a)  An individual is presumed to be a parent of a child if: (1)  Except as otherwise provided under part IX or the law of this State other than this chapter: (A)  The prospective presumed parent and the individual who gave birth to the child are married to each other and the child is born during the marriage, regardless of whether the marriage is or could be declared invalid and regardless of the gender of the two individuals; (B)  The prospective presumed parent and the individual who gave birth to the child were married to each other and the child is born no later than three hundred days after the marriage is terminated by death, divorce, or annulment, or after a decree of separation, regardless of whether the marriage is or could be declared invalid; or (C)  The prospective presumed parent and the individual who gave birth to the child married each other after the birth of the child, regardless of whether the marriage is or could be declared invalid, the prospective presumed parent at any time asserted parentage of the child, and: (i)  The assertion is in an acknowledgment of parentage as defined in part IV that is filed with the department of health; or (ii)  The prospective presumed parent agreed to be and is named as a parent of the child on the birth certificate of the child; (2)  The individual resided in the same household with the child before the child reached the age of majority and openly held out the child as the individual's child; or (3)  Pursuant to section -702, the prospective presumed parent submits to court-ordered genetic testing and the results, as stated in a report prepared by the testing laboratory, do not exclude the possibility of the prospective presumed parent's parentage of the child; provided that the results of the testing disclose: (A)  The individual has at least a ninety-nine per cent probability of parentage, using a prior probability of 0.50 as calculated by using the combined relationship index obtained in the testing; and (B)  A combined relationship index of at least one hundred to one. (b)  A presumption of parentage under this section may be overcome, and competing claims to parentage may be resolved, only by an adjudication under part V or VI or a valid denial of parentage under part VI. PART IV. VOLUNTARY ESTABLISHMENT OF PARENTAGE §   -401  Acknowledgment of parentage.  An individual who gave birth to a child and an alleged genetic parent of the child, intended parent under part VIII, or presumed parent may sign an acknowledgment of parentage to establish the parentage of the child. §   -402  Execution of acknowledgment of parentage.  (a)  An acknowledgment of parentage under section    -401 shall: (1)  Be in a record signed by the individual who gave birth to the child and by the other individual seeking to establish a parent-child relationship; provided that the signatures shall be attested by a notarial officer or witnessed; (2)  State that the child whose parentage is being acknowledged does not have: (A)  A presumed parent other than the individual seeking to establish the parent-child relationship; and (B)  Another acknowledged parent or adjudicated parent, or individual who is a parent of the child under part VIII or IX other than the individual who gave birth to the child; and (3)  State that the signatories understand that the acknowledgment is the equivalent of an adjudication of parentage of the child and that a challenge to the acknowledgment is permitted only under limited circumstances and is barred two years after the effective date of the acknowledgment. (b)  An acknowledgment of parentage shall be void if, at the time of signing: (1)  An individual, other than the individual seeking to establish parentage, is a presumed parent; or (2)  An individual, other than the individual who gave birth to the child or the individual seeking to establish parentage, is an acknowledged parent or adjudicated parent or a parent under part VIII or IX. §   -403  Expedited process of parentage.  (a)  To expedite the establishment of parentage, each public or private birthing hospital or birthing center, the child support enforcement agency, midwives, and the department of health shall provide parents the opportunity to voluntarily acknowledge the parentage of a child during the period immediately before or following the child's birth; provided that an individual who is a presumed parent under section -303(a)(1)(C) or (2) may only submit that individual's voluntary acknowledgment directly to the department of health.  The voluntary acknowledgment of parentage shall be in writing and shall consist of a single form signed under oath, by the individual who gave birth to the child, the individual seeking to establish a parent-child relationship, and a witness. The voluntary acknowledgment of parentage form shall include the social security numbers, dates of birth, places of birth, and ethnic backgrounds of each signatory.  An electronic version of the voluntary acknowledgment of parentage form may be used. (b)  Before the signing of the voluntary acknowledgment of parentage form, designated staff members of a facility at which a voluntary acknowledgment may be submitted shall provide to both the individual who gave birth to the child and the other signatory, if either are present at the facility: (1)  Written materials regarding parentage establishment; (2)  Forms necessary to voluntarily acknowledge parentage; (3)  Oral, video, audio, or written descriptions of the alternatives to, the legal consequences of, and the rights and responsibilities of acknowledging parentage, including, if one parent is a minor, any right afforded due to minority status; and (4)  The opportunity to speak with staff, either by telephone or in person, who are trained to clarify information and answer questions about parentage establishment. (c)  The completed voluntary acknowledgment forms shall clearly identify the name and position of the staff member who provides information to the parents regarding parentage establishment.  The provision by designated staff members of the facility of the information required by this section shall not constitute the unauthorized practice of law. Birthing hospital and birthing center staff, midwives, child support enforcement agency staff, and department of health staff shall not be subject to civil, criminal, or administrative liability for a negligent act or omission relative to the accuracy of the information provided or for filing the declaration with the appropriate state or local agencies.  Each facility shall send to the department of health the original acknowledgment of parentage form, or an electronic version, containing the social security numbers, dates of birth, places of birth, and ethnic backgrounds of both signatories, with any other information required by the department of health so that the birth certificate issued includes the names of the signatories.  The birth certificate shall be promptly recorded by the department of health. (d)  The child support enforcement agency shall: (1)  Provide to any individual or facility the necessary: (A)  Materials and forms and a written description of the rights and responsibilities related to voluntary acknowledgment of parentage; and (B)  Training, guidance, and written instructions regarding voluntary acknowledgment of parentage; (2)  Annually assess each facility's parentage establishment program; and (3)  Determine if a voluntary acknowledgment has been filed with the department of health whenever it receives an application for parentage establishment services. (e)  Notwithstanding sections 338-17.7 and 338-18(b), the department of health shall disclose to the child support enforcement agency, upon request, all voluntary acknowledgment of parentage forms on file with the department of health. (f)  The signed voluntary acknowledgment of parentage shall constitute a legal finding of parentage, subject to the right of any signatory to rescind the acknowledgment: (1)  Within sixty days of signature; or (2)  Before the date of an administrative or judicial proceeding relating to the child, including a proceeding to establish a support order to which the signatory is a party, whichever is sooner. (g)  Following the sixty-day period pursuant to subsection (f), a signed voluntary acknowledgment of parentage may be challenged in court only on the basis of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact, with the burden of proof on the challenger.  The legal responsibilities of any signatory arising from the acknowledgment, including child support obligations, shall not be suspended during the challenge, except for good cause shown. (h)  The courts and office of child support hearings of this State shall give full faith and credit to affidavits for the voluntary acknowledgment of parentage signed in any other state and made in compliance with the law of that state, and these affidavits shall constitute legal findings of parentage subject to subsections (f) and (g). (i)  Judicial and administrative proceedings shall not be required or permitted to ratify an unchallenged acknowledgment of parentage.  A voluntary acknowledgment of parentage signed by the individuals and filed with the department of health shall be the basis for establishing and enforcing a support obligation through a judicial or administrative proceeding. PART V. PROCEEDING TO ADJUDICATE PARENTAGE §   -501  Pretrial hearings.  (a)  As soon as practicable after an action to declare the existence or nonexistence of a parent-child relationship has been brought, an informal hearing shall be held.  The public shall be barred from the hearing.  A record of the proceeding or any portion thereof shall be kept if any party requests, or the court orders.  Rules of evidence need not be observed. (b)  The court, in its discretion, may waive a hearing on an uncontested parentage complaint submitted by an individual who gave birth to a child, an alleged genetic parent of the child, a presumed parent of the child, or a functional parent of the child with proof provided by affidavit. §   -502  Pretrial recommendations.  (a)  On the basis of the information produced at the pretrial hearing held pursuant to section -501, the judge conducting the hearing shall evaluate the probability of determining the existence or nonexistence of the parent-child relationship in a trial and whether a judicial declaration of the relationship would be in the best interest of the child pursuant to section 571-46(b).  On the basis of the evaluation, an appropriate recommendation for settlement shall be made to the parties, which may include any of the following: (1)  That the action be dismissed with or without prejudice; (2)  That the matter be compromised by an agreement among the birth parent and the individual who is seeking to have parentage adjudicated, and the child, in which the individual seeking to be adjudicated to be a parent is not adjudicated to be a parent but in which a defined economic obligation is undertaken in favor of the child and, if appropriate, in favor of the parent, subject to approval by the judge conducting the hearing.  In reviewing the obligation undertaken by the individual whose parentage is to be adjudicated in a compromise agreement, the judge conducting the hearing shall consider the best interest of the child, in light of the factors enumerated in section 576D‑7(a), discounted by the improbability, as it appears to the judge, of establishing the parentage or non-parentage of the individual whose parentage is to be adjudicated in a trial of the action; or (3)  That the individual whose parentage is to be adjudicated voluntarily acknowledges parentage of the child. (b)  If the parties accept a recommendation made in accordance with subsection (a), judgment shall be entered accordingly. (c)  If a party refuses to accept the final recommendation made under subsection (a) and genetic tests have not been taken, the court may order the parties to submit to genetic tests, if practicable.  Thereafter the judge shall make an appropriate final recommendation.  If a party refuses to accept the final recommendation, the action shall be set for trial. (d)  A guardian ad litem appointed for the child may accept or refuse to accept a recommendation under this section. (e)  The pretrial hearing may be terminated and the action set for trial if the judge conducting the hearing finds it unlikely that all parties would accept a recommendation the judge may make under subsection (a) or (c). §   -503  Civil action.  (a) An action under this chapter shall be a civil action governed by the Hawaii family court rules or the Hawaii rules of civil procedure.  The individual who gave birth to the child and the individual whose parentage is to be adjudicated shall be competent to testify and may be compelled to testify; provided that no criminal prosecution, other than a prosecution for perjury, shall afterwards be commenced against the individual who gave birth to the child or the individual whose parentage is to be adjudicated on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which they may testify or produce evidence under this chapter, documentary or otherwise.  Part VII shall apply in any action brought under this chapter. (b)  Testimony relating to sexual access to the individual who gave birth to the child by an unidentified person at any time or by an identified person at a time other than the probable time of conception of the child shall be inadmissible in evidence, unless offered by the individual who gave birth to the child. (c)  Notwithstanding the limitation on the admission of evidence stated in subsection (b), evidence offered with respect to an individual who is not subject to the jurisdiction of the court concerning sexual intercourse or assisted reproduction with the individual who gave birth to the child at or about the probable time of conception of the child shall be admissible in evidence only if the individual offering the evidence has undergone and made available to the court genetic tests, including genetic tests the results of which do not exclude the possibility of the individual's parentage of the child. §   -504  Judgment or order.  (a) The judgment or order of the court determining the existence or nonexistence of the parent-child relationship shall be determinative for all purposes. (b)  If the judgment or order of the court is at variance with the child's birth certificate, the court shall order that a new birth certificate be issued pursuant to section    -510. (c)  The judgment or order may contain any other provision directed against the appropriate party to the proceeding, concerning the duty of support, the custody and guardianship of the child, visitation privileges with the child, the furnishing of bond or other security for the payment of the judgment, or any other matter in the best interest of the child.  Upon neglect or refusal to give this security, or upon default of a parent or a parent's surety in compliance with the terms of the judgment, the court may order the forfeiture of the security and the application of the proceeds thereof toward the payment of any sums due under the terms of the judgment and may also sequester a parent's personal estate, and the rents and profits of a parent's real estate, and may appoint a receiver thereof, and may cause a parent's personal estate, including any salaries, wages, commissions, or other moneys owed to the parent and the rents and profits of the parent's real estate, to be applied toward the meeting of the terms of the judgment, to the extent that the court, from time to time, deems just and reasonable.  The judgment or order may direct a parent to pay the reasonable expenses of the pregnancy and childbirth, including but not limited to medical insurance premiums, such as for  MedQuest, that cover the periods of pregnancy and childbirth.  The court may further order the noncustodial parent to reimburse the custodial parent, the child, or any public agency for reasonable expenses incurred before entry of judgment, including support, maintenance, education, and funeral expenses expended for the benefit of the child. (d)  Support judgments or orders ordinarily shall be for periodic payments that may vary in amount.  In the best interest of the child, a lump sum payment or the purchase of an annuity may be ordered in lieu of periodic payments of support.  The court may limit the obligor parent's liability for past support of the child to the proportion of the expenses already incurred that the court deems just. (e)  In determining the amount to be paid by a parent for support of the child and the period during which the duty of support is owed, a court enforcing the obligation of support shall use the guidelines established under section 576D-7. Provision may be made for the support, maintenance, and education of an adult or minor child and an incompetent adult child, regardless of whether the petition is made before or after the child has attained the age of majority. (f)  Whenever a parent of a child is a minor, unmarried, and not able to provide full support, the court may order one or both parents of the minor to support the child until the minor reaches the age of majority, is otherwise emancipated, or is financially able to fully support the child, whichever occurs first.  For the purposes of this subsection: (1)  The judgment or order for support shall be made against the parent or parents of the minor to the extent that the minor is unable to support the child; (2)  The resources, standard of living, and earning ability of the parent or parents of the minor shall be considered under subsection (d) in determining the amount of support; and (3)  The parent or parents of the minor shall be an obligor under this chapter and chapter 571 and any action against the obligor to collect support may be pursued against the parent or parents of the minor. §   -505  Costs. The court may order reasonable fees of counsel, experts, and the child's guardian ad litem, and other costs of the action and pretrial proceedings, including genetic tests, subject to section -703, to be paid by the parties in proportions and at times determined by the court. §   -506  Enforcement of judgment or order.  (a) If existence of the parent-child relationship is declared, or parentage or a duty of support has been acknowledged or adjudicated under this chapter or under prior law, the obligation of a parent may be enforced in the same or other proceedings by the other parent, the child, the public authority that has furnished or may furnish the reasonable expenses of pregnancy, childbirth, education, support, or funeral, or by any other individual, including a private agency, to the extent the individual has furnished or is furnishing these expenses. (b)  The court may order support payments to be made to a parent or an adult child, or through the child support enforcement agency as its rules permit, or through an individual, corporation, or agency designated to administer support payments for the benefit of the child under the supervision of the court. (c)  Wilful failure to obey the judgment or order of the court shall be a civil contempt of the court.  All remedies for the enforcement of judgments shall apply to this chapter.  When a court of competent jurisdiction issues an order compelling a parent to furnish support, including child support, medical support, or other remedial care, for the parent's child, it shall constitute prima facie evidence of a civil contempt of court upon proof that: (1)  The order was made, filed, and served on the parent or proof that the parent was present in court at the time the order was pronounced; and (2)  The parent did not comply with the order. An order of civil contempt of court based on prima facie evidence under this subsection shall clearly state that the failure to comply with the order of civil contempt of court may subject the parent to a penalty that may include imprisonment or, if imprisonment is immediately ordered, the conditions that must be met for release from imprisonment. A party may also prove civil contempt of court by means other than prima facie evidence under this subsection. §   -507  Modification of judgment or order.  (a) The court shall have continuing jurisdiction to modify or revoke a judgment or order: (1)  For future education and support; and (2)  With respect to matters listed in section   ‑504(c) and (d) and    -506(b); provided that a court entering a judgment or order for the payment of a lump sum or the purchase of an annuity under section   -504(d) may specify that the judgment or order may not be modified or revoked. (b)  In those cases where child support payments are to continue due to the adult child's pursuance of education, the child support enforcement agency, at least three months before the adult child's nineteenth birthday, shall send notice by regular mail to the adult child and the custodial parent that prospective child support will be suspended unless proof is provided by the custodial parent or adult child, to the child support enforcement agency, before the child's nineteenth birthday, that the child is presently enrolled as a full-time student in school or has been accepted into and plans to attend a post-high school university, college, or vocational school as a full-time student for the next semester. If the custodial parent or adult child fails to do so, prospective child support payments may be automatically suspended by the child support enforcement agency, hearings officer, or court. In addition, if applicable, the child support enforcement agency, hearings officer, or court may issue an order terminating existing assignments against the responsible parent's income and income assignment orders. (c)  The need to provide for the child's health care needs through health insurance or other means shall be a basis for petitioning for a modification of the support order. §   -508  Hearings and records; confidentiality.  (a) Notwithstanding any other law concerning public hearings and records, unless the court orders otherwise, any hearing or trial in a case filed on or before January 1, 2021, under chapter 584, before its repeal, and any hearing or trial held to establish parentage under part VIII or IX shall be held in closed court without admittance of any individual other than those individuals necessary to the action or proceeding.  All papers and records pertaining to the action or proceeding, whether part of the permanent record of the court or of a file of the department of health or elsewhere shall not be open to inspection by any individual other than the parties to the proceeding, the child who is the subject of the proceeding, their attorneys, and the department of health, unless consent is given by the court and all interested persons, or inspection is authorized by an order of the court for good cause shown.  The individual seeking to inspect the document may be required to pay the expense of preparing a copy of the document to be inspected. (b)  Upon parentage being established, the confidentiality requirement shall not extend to the judgment and all subsequently filed documents that are used in good faith for support and medical expenses, insurance, or enforcement purposes; provided that the confidentiality requirement shall continue to apply to any references to a non-adjudicated alleged or presumed parent. §   -509  Court filings; minutes of proceedings; posting requirement.  The judiciary shall post on its website the titles of all court filings and the minutes of court proceedings in cases brought under this chapter except for actions filed pursuant to part VIII or IX; provided that the judiciary shall redact information that has been made confidential by any statute, rule of court, or court order; provided further that, on request of a party and for good cause, the court may close a proceeding and records to the public; provided further that the titles of all court filings for the case and the contents of a final order shall be available for public inspection, with other papers and records available for public inspection, only with the consent of the parties or by court order. §   -510  Birth records.  (a)  Upon order of a court of this State or upon request or order of a court of another state, or following acknowledgment as provided in section    -401, the department of health shall prepare a new birth certificate consistent with the findings of the court or in cases of acknowledgment under section    -401, consistent with the acknowledgment, and shall substitute the new birth certificate for the original birth certificate. (b)  The fact that a parent-child relationship was declared or acknowledged after the child's birth shall not be ascertainable from the new birth certificate, but the actual place and date of birth shall be shown. (c)  Unless the court orders otherwise, the evidence upon which the new birth certificate was made and the original birth certificate shall not be open to inspection by any individual other than the parties to the proceeding, the child who is the subject of the birth certificate, their attorneys, and the department of health.  A court shall only authorize an individual to inspect the evidence upon which the new birth certificate was made for good cause shown.  The individual seeking to inspect the document may be required to pay the expense of preparing a copy of the document to be inspected. §   -511  Parentage judgment, acknowledgment, support order; social security number.  The social security number of any individual who is subject to a parentage judgment or acknowledgment, or a support order issued under this chapter, shall be placed in the records relating to the matter in compliance with any other court rule or law. §   -512  Filing of acknowledgments and adjudications with department of health. All voluntary acknowledgments and adjudications of parentage by judicial process shall be filed with the department of health for comparison with information in the state case registry established pursuant to section 576D‑6(a)(12).  Filing of the adjudications of parentage shall be the responsibility of the natural parent or individual or agency as the court shall direct. PART VI.  SPECIAL RULES FOR PROCEEDINGS §   -601  Adjudicating parentage of child with alleged genetic parent.  (a)  A proceeding to determine whether an alleged genetic parent who is not a presumed parent is a parent of a child may be commenced: (1)  Before the child becomes an adult; or (2)  After the child becomes an adult, but only if the child initiates the proceeding. (b)  Except as otherwise provided by law, this subsection shall apply in a proceeding described in subsection (a) if the individual who gave birth to the child is the only other individual with a claim to parentage of the child.  The court shall adjudicate an alleged genetic parent to be a parent of the child if the alleged genetic parent: (1)  Is identified under section -705 as a genetic parent of the child and the identification is not successfully challenged under section    -705; (2)  Admits parentage in a pleading, when making an appearance, or during a hearing; the court accepts the admission; and the court determines the alleged genetic parent to be a parent of the child; (3)  Declines to submit to genetic testing ordered by the court or the child support enforcement agency, in which case the court may adjudicate the alleged genetic parent to be a parent of the child even if the alleged genetic parent denies a genetic relationship with the child; (4)  Is in default after service of process and the court determines the alleged genetic parent to be a parent of the child; or (5)  Is neither identified nor excluded as a genetic parent by genetic testing and, based on other evidence, the court determines the alleged genetic parent to be a parent of the child. (c)  If in a proceeding involving an alleged genetic parent at least one other individual in addition to the individual who gave birth to the child has a claim to parentage of the child, the court shall adjudicate parentage under section    -607, unless a valid denial of parentage is filed in accordance with section    -608. §   -602  Adjudicating parentage of child with presumed parent.  (a)  A proceeding to determine whether a presumed parent is a parent of a child may be commenced: (1)  Before the child becomes an adult; or (2)  After the child becomes an adult, but only if the child initiates the proceeding. (b)  A presumption of parentage under section -303 cannot be overcome after the child attains two years of age unless the court determines: (1)  The presumed parent is not a genetic parent, never resided with the child, and never held out the child as the presumed parent's child; or (2)  The child has more than one presumed parent. (c)  Except as otherwise provided by law, the following rules shall apply in a proceeding to adjudicate a presumed parent's parentage of a child if the individual who gave birth to the child is the only other individual with a claim to parentage of the child: (1)  If no party to the proceeding challenges the presumed parent's parentage of the child, the court shall adjudicate the presumed parent to be a parent of the child; (2)  If the presumed parent is identified under section    -705 as a genetic parent of the child and that identification is not successfully challenged under section     -705, the court shall adjudicate the presumed parent to be a parent of the child; and (3)  If the presumed parent is not identified under section    -705 as a genetic parent of the child and the presumed parent or the individual who gave birth to the child challenges the presumed parent's parentage of the child, the court shall adjudicate the parentage of the child in the best interest of the child based on the factors under sections    -607(a) and    -607(b). (d)  If in a proceeding to adjudicate a presumed parent's parentage of a child, another individual in addition to the individual who gave birth to the child asserts a claim to parentage of the child, the court shall adjudicate parentage under section    -607, unless a valid denial of parentage is filed in accordance with section -608. §   -603  Adjudicating claim of functional parentage of a child.  (a)  A proceeding to establish parentage of a child under this section may be commenced only by an individual who: (1)  Is alive when the proceeding is commenced; and (2)  Claims to be a functional parent of the child. (b)  An individual who claims to be a functional parent of a child shall commence a proceeding to establish parentage of a child under this section: (1)  Before the child attains eighteen years of age; and (2)  While the child is alive. (c)  The following rules shall govern standing of an individual who claims to be a functional parent of a child to maintain a proceeding under this section: (1)  The individual shall file an initial verified pleading alleging specific facts that support the claim to parentage of the child asserted under this section. The verified pleading shall be served on all parents and legal guardians of the child and any other party to the proceeding; (2)  An adverse party, parent, or legal guardian may file a pleading in response to the pleading filed under paragraph (1).  A responsive pleading shall be verified and must be served on parties to the proceeding; and (3)  Unless the court finds a hearing is necessary to determine disputed facts material to the issue of standing, the court shall determine, based on the pleadings under paragraphs (1) and (2), whether the individual has alleged facts sufficient to satisfy by a preponderance of the evidence the requirements of subsection (d).  If the court holds a hearing under this subsection, the hearing shall be held on an expedited basis. (d)  In a proceeding to adjudicate parentage of an individual who claims to be a functional parent of the child, if there is only one other individual who is a parent or has a claim to parentage of the child, the court shall adjudicate the individual who claims to be a functional parent to be a parent of the child if the individual demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that: (1)  The individual resided with the child as a regular member of the child's household for a significant period; (2)  The individual engaged in consistent caretaking of the child; (3)  The individual undertook full and permanent responsibilities of a parent of the child without expectation of financial compensation; (4)  The individual held out the child as the individual's child; (5)  The individual established a bonded and dependent relationship with the child that is parental in nature; (6)  Another parent of the child fostered or supported the bonded and dependent relationship required under paragraph (5); and (7)  Continuing the relationship between the individual and the child is in the best interest of the child. (e)  Subject to other limitations in this part, if in a proceeding to adjudicate parentage of an individual who claims to be a functional parent of the child, there is more than one other individual who is a parent or has a claim to parentage of the child and the court determines that the requirements of subsection (d) are satisfied, the court shall adjudicate parentage under section    -607, unless a valid denial of parentage is filed in accordance with section    -608. §   -604  Adjudicating parentage of child with acknowledged parent.  (a)  If a child has an acknowledged parent, a proceeding to challenge the acknowledgment of parentage, brought by a signatory to the acknowledgment, shall be governed by section    -403(g). (b)  If a child has an acknowledged parent, the following rules shall apply in a proceeding to challenge the acknowledgment of parentage brought by an individual, other than the child, who has standing under section    -203 and was not a signatory to the acknowledgment: (1)  The individual shall commence the proceeding no later than two years after the effective date of the acknowledgment, unless good cause is shown; (2)  The court may permit the proceeding only if the court finds permitting the proceeding is in the best interest of the child pursuant to section 571-46(b); and (3)  If the court permits the proceeding, the court shall adjudicate parentage under section    -607. §   -605  Adjudicating parentage of child with adjudicated parent.  (a)  If a child has an adjudicated parent, a proceeding to challenge the adjudication, brought by an individual who was a party to the adjudication or received notice under section -201, shall be governed by the rules governing a collateral attack on a judgment. (b)  If a child has an adjudicated parent, the following rules shall apply to a proceeding to challenge the adjudication of parentage brought by an individual, other than the child, who has standing under section    -203 and was not a party to the adjudication and did not receive notice under section    -201: (1)  The individual shall commence the proceeding no later than two years after the effective date of the adjudication, unless good cause is shown; (2)  The court may permit the proceeding only if the court finds permitting the proceeding is in the best interest of the child pursuant to section 571-46(b); and (3)  If the court permits the proceeding, the court shall adjudicate parentage under section    -607. §   -606  Adjudicating parentage of a child of assisted reproduction.  (a)  An individual who is a parent under part VIII or the individual who gave birth to the child may bring a proceeding to adjudicate parentage.  If the court determines the individual is a parent under part VIII, the court shall adjudicate the individual to be a parent of the child. (b)  In a proceeding to adjudicate an individual's parentage of a child under this section, if another individual other than the individual who gave birth to the child is a parent under part VIII, the court shall adjudicate the individual's parentage of the child under section -607. §   -607  Adjudicating competing claims of parentage.  (a) Except as otherwise provided by law, in a proceeding to adjudicate competing claims of, or challenges under section    ‑601,    ‑602, -603,    -604,    -605, or -606 to, parentage of a child by two or more individuals, the court shall adjudicate parentage in the best interest of the child, based on: (1)  The age of the child; (2)  The length of time during which each individual assumed the role of parent of the child; (3)  The nature of the relationship between the child and each individual; (4)  The harm to the child if the relationship between the child and each individual is not recognized; (5)  The basis for each individual's claim to parentage of the child; and (6)  Other equitable factors arising from the disruption of the relationship between the child and each individual or the likelihood of other harm to the child. (b)  If an individual challenges parentage based on the results of genetic testing, in addition to the factors listed in subsection (a), the court shall consider: (1)  The facts surrounding the discovery that the individual might not be a genetic parent of the child; and (2)  The length of time between the time that the individual was placed on notice that the individual might not be a genetic parent and the commencement of the proceeding. (c)  The court may adjudicate a child to have more than two parents under this chapter if the court finds that failure to recognize more than two parents would be detrimental to the child.  A finding of detriment to the child shall not require a finding of unfitness of any parent or individual seeking an adjudication of parentage.  In determining detriment to the child, the court shall consider all relevant factors, including the harm if the child is removed from a stable placement with an individual who has fulfilled the child's physical needs and psychological needs for care and affection and has assumed the role for a substantial period. §   -608  Denial of parentage.  An alleged genetic parent or presumed parent may sign a denial of parentage in a record filed with the court.  The denial of parentage shall be valid only if: (1)  Another individual other than the individual who gave birth to the child agrees to have that other individual's parentage of the child established under this part, and the agreement is in an affidavit filed with the court; (2)  The signature of the alleged genetic parent or presumed parent is attested by a notarial officer or witnesses; and (3)  The alleged genetic parent or presumed parent has not previously: (A)  Completed a valid acknowledgment of parentage, unless the previous acknowledgment was rescinded under section -403(f) or challenged successfully under section -403(g); or (B)  Been adjudicated to be a parent of the child. PART VII. GENETIC TESTING §   -701  Scope of part; limitation on use of genetic testing.  (a)  This part shall govern genetic testing of an individual in a proceeding to adjudicate parentage, whether the individual: (1)  Voluntarily submits to testing; or (2)  Is tested under an order of the court or the child support enforcement agency. (b)  Genetic testing shall not be used to: (1)  Challenge the parentage of an individual who is a parent under part VIII or IX; or (2)  Establish the parentage of an individual who is a donor. §   -702  Authority to order or deny genetic testing.  (a) Except as otherwise provided in this part or part V, in a proceeding under this chapter to determine parentage, the court shall order the child and any other individual to submit to genetic testing if a request for testing is supported by the sworn statement of a party: (1)  Alleging a reasonable possibility that the individual is the child's genetic parent; or (2)  Denying genetic parentage of the child and stating facts establishing a reasonable possibility that the individual is not a genetic parent. (b)  The child support enforcement agency may order genetic testing only if there is no presumed parent, acknowledged parent, or adjudicated parent of a child other than the individual who gave birth to the child. (c)  The court or the child support enforcement agency shall not order in utero genetic testing. (d)  If two or more individuals are subject to court‑ordered genetic testing, the court may order that testing be completed concurrently or sequentially. (e)  Genetic testing of an individual who gave birth to a child shall not be a condition precedent to testing of the child and an individual whose genetic parentage of the child is being determined.  If the individual who gave birth to the child is unavailable or declines to submit to genetic testing, the court may order genetic testing of the child and each individual whose genetic parentage of the child is being adjudicated. (f)  In a proceeding to adjudicate the parentage of a child having a presumed parent or an individual who claims to be a parent under section    -602, or to challenge an acknowledgment of parentage, the court may deny a motion for genetic testing of the child and any other individual after considering the factors in section -607(a) and (b). (g)  If an individual requesting genetic testing is barred under section    -402(a),    -403(g), -604(b), or    -605(b) from establishing the individual's parentage, the court shall deny the request for genetic testing. (h)  An order under this section for genetic testing shall be enforceable by contempt. §   -703  Requirements for genetic testing.  (a) Genetic testing shall be of a type reasonably relied on by experts in the field of genetic testing and performed in a testing laboratory accredited by: (1)  The AABB, formerly known as the American Association of Blood Banks, or a successor to its functions; or (2)  An accrediting body designated by the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. (b)  A specimen used in genetic testing may consist of a sample or a combination of samples of blood, buccal cells, bone, hair, or other body tissue or fluid.  The specimen used in the testing need not be of the same kind for each individual undergoing genetic testing. (c)  Based on the ethnic or racial group of an individual undergoing genetic testing, a testing laboratory shall determine the databases from which to select frequencies for use in calculating a relationship index.  If an individual or the child support enforcement agency objects to the laboratory's choice, the following rules shall apply: (1)  No later than thirty days after receipt of the report of the test, the objecting individual or the child support enforcement agency may request the court to require the laboratory to recalculate the relationship index using an ethnic or racial group different from that used by the laboratory; (2)  The individual or the child support enforcement agency objecting to the laboratory's choice under this subsection shall: (A)  If the requested frequencies are not available to the laboratory for the ethnic or racial group requested, provide the requested frequencies compiled in a manner recognized by accrediting bodies; or (B)  Engage another laboratory to perform the calculations; and (3)  The laboratory may use its own statistical estimate if there is a question as to which ethnic or racial group is appropriate.  The laboratory shall calculate the frequencies using statistics, if available, for any other ethnic or racial group requested. (d)  If, after recalculation of the relationship index under subsection (c) using a different ethnic or racial group, genetic testing under section    -705 does not identify an individual as a genetic parent of a child, the court may require an individual who has been tested to submit to additional genetic testing to identify a genetic parent. §   -704  Report of genetic testing.  (a)  In any hearing or trial brought under this chapter, a report of the facts and results of genetic tests ordered by the court under this chapter shall be admissible in evidence by affidavit of the person whose name is signed to the report, attesting to the procedures followed in obtaining the report.  A report of the facts and results of genetic tests shall be admissible as evidence of parentage without the need for foundation testimony or other proof of authenticity or accuracy, unless objection is made. (b)  Documentation from a testing laboratory of the following information shall be sufficient to establish a reliable chain of custody and allow the results of genetic testing to be admissible without testimony: (1)  The name and photograph of each individual whose specimen has been taken; (2)  The name of the individual who collected each specimen; (3)  The place and date each specimen was collected; (4)  The name of the individual who received each specimen in the testing laboratory; and (5)  The date each specimen was received. (c)  An alleged genetic parent or party to the parentage action who objects to the admission of the report concerning the genetic test results shall file a motion no later than twenty days after receiving a copy of the report and shall show good cause as to why a witness is necessary to lay the foundation for the admission of the report as evidence.  The court may, sua sponte or at a hearing on the motion, determine whether a witness shall be required to lay the foundation for the admission of the report as evidence.  The right to call witnesses to rebut the report shall be reserved to all parties. §   -705  Report of genetic testing.  (a) Subject to a challenge under subsection (b), an individual is identified under this chapter as a genetic parent of a child if genetic testing complies with this part and the results of the testing disclose: (1)  The individual has at least a ninety-nine per cent probability of parentage, using a prior probability of 0.50, as calculated by using the combined relationship index obtained in the testing; and (2)  A combined relationship index of at least one hundred to one. (b)  An individual identified under subsection (a) as a genetic parent of the child may challenge the genetic testing results only by other genetic testing satisfying the requirements of this part that: (1)  Excludes the individual as a genetic parent of the child; or (2)  Identifies another individual as a possible genetic parent of the child other than the individual: (A)  Who gave birth to the child; or (B)  Identified under subsection (a). (c)  If more than one individual other than the individual who gave birth is identified by genetic testing as a possible genetic parent of the child, the court shall order each individual to submit to further genetic testing to identify a genetic parent. (d)  If an original test result is contested, the court shall order further genetic testing with payment of the testing to be advanced and paid for by the contesting party. §   -706  Genetic testing when specimen not available.  (a) Subject to subsection (b), if a genetic-testing specimen is not available from an alleged genetic parent of a child, an individual seeking genetic testing demonstrates good cause, and the court finds that the circumstances are just, the court may order any of the following individuals to submit specimens for genetic testing: (1)  A parent of the alleged genetic parent; (2)  A sibling of the alleged genetic parent; (3)  Another child of the alleged genetic parent and the individual who gave birth to the other child; and (4)  Another relative of the alleged genetic parent necessary to complete genetic testing. (b)  To issue an order under this section, the court shall find that a need for genetic testing outweighs the legitimate interests of the individual sought to be tested. §   -707  Deceased individual.  If an individual seeking genetic testing demonstrates good cause, the court may order genetic testing of a deceased individual. PART VIII.  ASSISTED REPRODUCTION §   -801  Scope of part.  This part shall not apply to the birth of a child conceived by sexual intercourse or assisted reproduction under a surrogacy agreement under part IX. §   -802  Parental status of donor.  A donor is not a parent of a child conceived by assisted reproduction. §   -803  Parentage of child of assisted reproduction.  An individual who consents under section -804 to assisted reproduction by another individual with the intent to be a parent of a child conceived by the assisted reproduction is a parent of the child. §   -804  Consent to assisted reproduction.  (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), the consent described in section    -803 shall be in a record signed by an individual giving birth to a child conceived by assisted reproduction and the other individual who intends to be a parent of the child. (b)  Failure to consent in a record as required by subsection (a), before, on, or after the birth of the child shall not preclude the court from finding consent to parentage if: (1)  The individual giving birth to a child or the other individual proves by clear and convincing evidence the existence of an express agreement entered into before conception that the individual giving birth and the other individual intended they both would be parents of the child; or (2)  The individual giving birth to the child and the other individual for the first two years of the child's life, including any period of temporary absence, resided together in the same household with the child and both openly held out the child as the individual's child; provided that if an individual dies or becomes incapacitated before the child attains two years of age or the child dies before the child attains two years of age, the court may find consent under this subsection to parentage if a party proves by clear and convincing evidence that the individual giving birth to the child and the other individual intended to reside together in the same household with the child and both intended the individual would openly hold out the child as the individual's child, but the individual was prevented from carrying out that intent by death or incapacity. §   -805  Limitation on spouse's dispute of parentage.  (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), an individual who, at the time of the child's birth, is the spouse of an individual who gave birth to the child by assisted reproduction may not challenge the individual's own parentage of the child unless: (1)  No later than two years after the birth of the child or the date of which the individual first learns of the birth of the child, whichever is later, the individual commences a proceeding to adjudicate the individual's parentage of the child; and (2)  The court finds the individual did not consent to the assisted reproduction, before, on, or after the birth of the child, or withdrew consent under section   ‑807. (b)  A proceeding to adjudicate a spouse's parentage of a  child born by assisted reproduction may be commenced at any time if the court determines: (1)  The spouse neither provided a gamete for, nor consented to, the assisted reproduction; (2)  The spouse and the individual who gave birth to the child have not cohabited since the probable time of assisted reproduction; and (3)  The spouse never openly held out the child as the spouse's child. (c)  This section shall apply to a spouse's dispute of parentage even if the spouse's marriage is declared invalid after assisted reproduction occurs. §   -806  Effect of certain legal proceedings regarding marriage.  If a marriage of an individual who gives birth to a child conceived by assisted reproduction is terminated through divorce or dissolution, subject to legal separation or separate maintenance, declared invalid, or annulled before transfer of gametes or embryos to said individual, a former spouse of said individual is not a parent of the child unless the former spouse consented in a record that the former spouse would be a parent of the child if assisted reproduction were to occur after a divorce, dissolution, legal separation, separate maintenance, declaration of invalidity, or annulment, and the former spouse did not withdraw consent under section    -807. §   -807  Withdrawal of consent.  (a)  An individual who consents under section    -804 to assisted reproduction may withdraw consent any time before a transfer by giving notice in a record of the withdrawal of consent to the individual who agreed to give birth to a child conceived by assisted reproduction and to any fertility clinic or health care provider facilitating the assisted reproduction.  Failure to give notice to the fertility clinic or health care provider shall not affect a determination of parentage under this part. (b)  An individual who withdraws consent under subsection (a) is not a parent of the child under this part. §   -808  Parental status of deceased individual.  (a)  If an individual who intends to be a parent of a child conceived by assisted reproduction dies during the period between the transfer of a gamete or embryo and the birth of the child, the individual's death shall not preclude the establishment of the individual's parentage of the child if the individual otherwise would be a parent of the child under this chapter. (b)  If an individual who consented in a record to assisted reproduction by an individual who agreed to give birth to a child dies before a transfer of gametes or embryos, the deceased individual is a parent of a child conceived by the assisted reproduction only if: (1)  Either: (A)  The individual consented in a record that if assisted reproduction were to occur after the death of the individual, the individual would be a parent of the child; or (B)  The individual's intent to be a parent of a child conceived by assisted reproduction after the individual's death is established by clear and convincing evidence; and (2)  Either: (A)  The embryo is in utero no later than thirty-six months after the individual's death; or (B)  The child is born no later than forty-five months after the individual's death. PART IX. SURROGACY AGREEMENT A.

(i)  If a married couple is divorced before placement of eggs, sperm, or embryos, a child resulting from the assisted reproduction shall not be treated as a child of the birth mother's former spouse, unless the former spouse consented in a record that, if assisted reproduction were to occur after divorce, the child would be treated as the former spouse's child. (j)  If, in a record, an individual withdraws consent to assisted reproduction before placement of eggs, sperm, or embryos, a child resulting from the assisted reproduction shall not be treated as a child of that individual, unless the individual subsequently satisfies subsection (f). (k)  If, under this section, an individual is a parent of a child of assisted reproduction who is conceived after the individual's death, the child shall be treated as in gestation at the individual's death for purposes of section 560:2-104(b)(2) if the child is: (1)  In utero no later than thirty-six months after the individual's death; or (2)  Born no later than forty-five months after the individual's death.] Except as otherwise provided under section 560:2-127, parentage of an individual conceived by assisted reproduction shall be determined under part VIII of chapter    , other than section    -808(b)(2)."

SB1231 HD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1231 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO PARENTAGE. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the State's existing parentage laws need to be updated to include current concepts of families, parenthood, conception, gestation, and parental rights.  The legislature further finds that the Uniform Parentage Act of 2017, among other things, ensures the equal treatment of children born to same-gender couples, adds an additional status of functional parent as a legal parent, and includes provisions that reflect developments in surrogacy and assisted reproductive technology. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to adopt portions of the Uniform Parentage Act of 2017 to update existing law. SECTION 2.  The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Chapter uniform parentage act Part i. General provisions §   -101  Short title.  This chapter may be cited as the Uniform Parentage Act. §   -102  Definitions.  As used in this chapter: "Acknowledged parent" means an individual who has established a parent-child relationship under part IV.

"Probability of parentage" means, for the ethnic or racial group to which an individual alleged to be a parent belongs, the probability that a hypothesized genetic relationship is supported, compared to the probability that a genetic relationship is supported between the child and a random individual of the ethnic or racial group used in the hypothesized genetic relationship, expressed as a percentage incorporating the combined relationship index and a prior probability. "Record" means information that is written or printed, or that is stored in an electronic or other medium and is retrievable in a perceivable form.

PART II. JURISDICTION §   -201  Jurisdiction; venue.  (a)  Without limiting the jurisdiction of any other court, the family court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought under this chapter, chapter 576B, or chapter 583A.  The action may be joined with an action for divorce, annulment, separate maintenance, or support. (b)  An individual who has sexual intercourse, undergoes or consents to assisted reproductive technology, or consents to an assisted reproductive or surrogacy technology agreement in this State thereby submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of this State as to an action brought under this chapter with respect to a child who may have been conceived by that act of intercourse or assisted reproductive technology, regardless of where the child is born.  A court of this State with jurisdiction to adjudicate parentage may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident individual, or a guardian or conservator of the individual, if the conditions prescribed in section 576B-201 are satisfied.  In addition to any other method provided by statute, personal jurisdiction over a resident and nonresident individual may be acquired by personal service within or outside this State or by service by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, with return receipt requested. (c)  In addition to any other method of service provided by statute or court rule, if the respondent is not found within the circuit, service may be effectuated by certified or registered mail, with request for a return receipt and direction to deliver to addressee only.  The return receipt signed by the respondent shall be prima facie evidence that the respondent accepted delivery of the complaint and summons on the date set forth on the receipt.  For service effectuated by certified or registered mail, an electronic copy or facsimile of the signature of the served individual or certified mailers provided by the United States Postal Service shall constitute valid proof of service on the individual.  Actual receipt by the respondent of the complaint and summons sent by certified or registered mail shall be the equivalent to personal service on the respondent by an authorized process server as of the date of the receipt. (d)  If it appears that the respondent has refused to accept service by certified or registered mail or is concealing the respondent's self or evading service, or the petitioner does not know the address or residence of the respondent and has not been able to ascertain the same after reasonable and due inquiry and search, the court may authorize notice of the parentage action and the time and date of hearing by publication or by any other manner that is reasonably calculated to give the party actual notice of proceedings and an opportunity to be heard, including the following: (1)  When publication is authorized, the summons shall be published once a week for four consecutive weeks in a publication of general circulation in the circuit.  The publication of general circulation shall be designated by the court in the order for publication of the summons.  Notice by publication shall have the same force and effect as the individual having been personally served with the summons; provided that the date of the last publication shall be set no less than twenty-one days before the return date stated in the summons.  Proof of service shall be satisfied by an affidavit or declaration by the authorized representative for the publication that the notice was given in the manner prescribed by the court; (2)  When posting to an online publication website is authorized, proof of service shall be satisfied by an affidavit or declaration by the authorized representative for the publication that the notice was given in the manner prescribed by the court; (3)  When service by electronic mail or posting to a social networking account is authorized, proof of service shall be satisfied by an affidavit or declaration by the process server that the notice was given in the manner prescribed by the court; and (4)  When service is made by posting to a public bulletin board, proof of service shall be satisfied by an affidavit or declaration by the process server that the notice was given in the manner prescribed by the court. (e)  The action may be brought in the county in which: (1)  The child, or any parent, alleged genetic parent, functional parent, or presumed parent resides or is found; (2)  The child was born; (3)  Proceedings for probate of the parent's estate have been or could be commenced, if a parent is deceased; or (4)  Assisted reproductive technology was performed, or as specified in an assisted reproduction or surrogacy agreement, if any. §   -202  Parentage determinations from other states and territories.  Parentage determinations from other states and territories, whether established through voluntary acknowledgment or through administrative or judicial processes, shall be treated the same as a parentage adjudication in this State.  A determination addressing only parentage in another state shall not preclude a court in this State from addressing other related issues. §   -203  Who may bring action; when action may be brought; process, warrant, bond.  (a)  A child or guardian ad litem of the child, an individual who is the child's parent under this chapter, an individual whose parentage of the child is to be adjudicated, a personal representative of a deceased parent of the child, a personal representative of a deceased individual who otherwise would be entitled to maintain a proceeding, or the child support enforcement agency may bring an action for the purpose of declaring the existence or nonexistence of a parent‑child relationship in accordance with the following: (1)  If the child is the subject of an adoption proceeding, an action may be brought: (A)  Within thirty days after the date of the child's birth in any case when a parent relinquishes the child for adoption during the thirty-day period; or (B)  Any time before the date of execution by a parent of a valid consent to the child's adoption, or before placement of the child with adoptive parents; (2)  If the child has not become the subject of an adoption proceeding, within three years after the child reaches the age of majority or any time after that for good cause; provided that any period of time during which the individual whose parentage is to be adjudicated is absent from the State or is openly cohabitating with a parent of the child or is contributing to the support of the child, shall not be computed; (3)  This section shall not extend the time within which a right of inheritance or a right to a succession may be asserted beyond the time otherwise provided by law relating to distribution and closing of decedents' estates or to the determination of heirship; and (4)  A personal representative for purposes of this section may be appointed by the court upon a filing of an ex parte motion by one of the parties entitled to file a parentage action.  Probate requirements need not be met.  Appointment of a personal representative in this section shall be limited to representation in proceedings under this chapter. (b)  When an action is brought under this section, process shall issue in the form of a summons and an order directed to the individual whose parentage of the child is to be adjudicated, requiring each party to appear and to show cause why the action should not be brought.  The court, in its discretion, may waive a hearing on an uncontested parentage complaint submitted by an individual who gave birth to a child, an alleged genetic parent of the child, a presumed parent of the child, or a functional parent of the child with proof provided by affidavit. If, at any stage of the proceedings, there appears probable cause to believe that the individual whose parentage of the child is to be adjudicated will fail to appear in response to the summons or will flee the jurisdiction of the court, the court may issue a warrant directed to the sheriff, deputy sheriff, or any police officer within the circuit, requiring the individual to be arrested and brought for pretrial proceedings before the family court.  Upon the pretrial proceedings, the court may require the individual to enter into bond with good sureties to the State in a sum to be fixed by the court for each individual's appearance and the trial of the proceeding in the family court.  If the individual whose parentage of the child is to be adjudicated fails to give the bond required, the court may immediately commit that individual to the custody of the chief of police of the county, there to remain until that individual enters into the required bond or otherwise is discharged by due process of law.  If the individual whose parentage of the child is to be adjudicated fails to appear in any proceeding under this chapter, any bond for that individual's appearance in any proceeding under this chapter shall be forfeited; provided that the trial of, or other proceedings in, the action shall proceed as though that individual were present, and the court shall make orders as it deems proper upon the findings as though that individual were in court. In case of forfeiture of any appearance bond, the money collected upon the forfeiture shall be applied in payment of the judgment against the individual if they are adjudicated to be a parent under this chapter. (c)  Regardless of its terms, an agreement, other than an agreement approved by the court in accordance with section   ‑502(a)(2), between a parent and the individual whose parentage of the child is to be adjudicated shall not bar an action under this section. (d)  Except as otherwise provided in section -910, if an action under this section is brought before the birth of the child, all proceedings shall be stayed until after the birth except service of process and the taking of depositions to perpetuate testimony. (e)  Subject to the requirements of section -303(a), with respect to a child who was not conceived through assisted reproduction, where a married individual has not had sexual contact with the married individual's spouse nor resided in the same house with the spouse for at least three hundred days before the birth of the child and the spouse cannot be contacted after due diligence, the court may accept an affidavit by the married individual, attesting to the married individual's diligent efforts to contact the married individual's spouse and providing clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption of the parentage of the subject child, and upon the court's satisfaction, notice of the spouse may be waived and the spouse need not be made a party in the parentage proceedings.  The court, after receiving evidence, may also enter a finding of non-parentage of the spouse. (f)  With respect to a child who was not conceived through assisted reproduction, where a married individual has not had sexual contact with the married individual's spouse nor resided in the same house with the spouse for at least three hundred days before the birth of the child, and the biological parent is known, parentage in the married spouse may be disestablished by submission of affidavits of both spouses and the biological parent stating the name and birth date of the child and acknowledgment that the spouse is not the parent and that the biological parent should be adjudicated as the legal parent. §   -204  Representation of child; action if public assistance moneys are paid; child support enforcement agency.  The child may be made a party to the action and may be represented by the child's general guardian or a guardian ad litem appointed by the court.  The child's parent shall not represent the child as guardian or otherwise.  Subject to section    ‑203, each individual presumed to be a parent under section    ‑303 and the child support enforcement agency, if public moneys are or have been paid for the support of the subject child, shall be made parties, or, if not subject to the jurisdiction of the court, shall be given notice of the action in a manner prescribed by the court and an opportunity to be heard. PART III. PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP §   -301  Establishment of parent-child relationship.  A parent-child relationship is established between an individual and a child if: (1)  The individual gives birth to the child, except as otherwise provided in part IX; (2)  There is a presumption under section -303 of the individual's parentage of the child, unless the presumption is overcome in a judicial proceeding or a valid denial of parentage is made under part VI; (3)  The individual is adjudicated as a parent of the child under part V; (4)  The individual adopts the child; (5)  The individual acknowledges parentage of the child under part IV, unless the acknowledgment is rescinded under section    -403(f) or successfully challenged under part IV or V; (6)  The individual's parentage of the child is established under part VIII; or (7)  The individual's parentage of the child is established under part IX. §   -302  Relationship not dependent on marriage.  A parent-child relationship extends equally to every child and parent, regardless of the marital status of the parent. §   -303  Presumption of parentage.  (a)  An individual is presumed to be a parent of a child if: (1)  Except as otherwise provided under part IX or the law of this State other than this chapter: (A)  The prospective presumed parent and the individual who gave birth to the child are married to each other and the child is born during the marriage, regardless of whether the marriage is or could be declared invalid and regardless of the gender of the two individuals; (B)  The prospective presumed parent and the individual who gave birth to the child were married to each other and the child is born no later than three hundred days after the marriage is terminated by death, divorce, or annulment, or after a decree of separation, regardless of whether the marriage is or could be declared invalid; or (C)  The prospective presumed parent and the individual who gave birth to the child married each other after the birth of the child, regardless of whether the marriage is or could be declared invalid, the prospective presumed parent at any time asserted parentage of the child, and: (i)  The assertion is in an acknowledgment of parentage as defined in part IV that is filed with the department of health; or (ii)  The prospective presumed parent agreed to be and is named as a parent of the child on the birth certificate of the child; (2)  The individual resided in the same household with the child before the child reached the age of majority and openly held out the child as the individual's child; or (3)  Pursuant to section -702, the prospective presumed parent submits to court-ordered genetic testing and the results, as stated in a report prepared by the testing laboratory, do not exclude the possibility of the prospective presumed parent's parentage of the child; provided that the results of the testing disclose: (A)  The individual has at least a ninety-nine per cent probability of parentage, using a prior probability of 0.50 as calculated by using the combined relationship index obtained in the testing; and (B)  A combined relationship index of at least one hundred to one. (b)  A presumption of parentage under this section may be overcome, and competing claims to parentage may be resolved, only by an adjudication under part V or VI or a valid denial of parentage under part VI. PART IV. VOLUNTARY ESTABLISHMENT OF PARENTAGE §   -401  Acknowledgment of parentage.  An individual who gave birth to a child and an alleged genetic parent of the child, intended parent under part VIII, or presumed parent may sign an acknowledgment of parentage to establish the parentage of the child. §   -402  Execution of acknowledgment of parentage.  (a)  An acknowledgment of parentage under section    -401 shall: (1)  Be in a record signed by the individual who gave birth to the child and by the other individual seeking to establish a parent-child relationship; provided that the signatures shall be attested by a notarial officer or witnessed; (2)  State that the child whose parentage is being acknowledged does not have: (A)  A presumed parent other than the individual seeking to establish the parent-child relationship; and (B)  Another acknowledged parent or adjudicated parent, or individual who is a parent of the child under part VIII or IX other than the individual who gave birth to the child; and (3)  State that the signatories understand that the acknowledgment is the equivalent of an adjudication of parentage of the child and that a challenge to the acknowledgment is permitted only under limited circumstances and is barred two years after the effective date of the acknowledgment. (b)  An acknowledgment of parentage shall be void if, at the time of signing: (1)  An individual, other than the individual seeking to establish parentage, is a presumed parent; or (2)  An individual, other than the individual who gave birth to the child or the individual seeking to establish parentage, is an acknowledged parent or adjudicated parent or a parent under part VIII or IX. §   -403  Expedited process of parentage.  (a)  To expedite the establishment of parentage, each public or private birthing hospital or birthing center, the child support enforcement agency, midwives, and the department of health shall provide parents the opportunity to voluntarily acknowledge the parentage of a child during the period immediately before or following the child's birth; provided that an individual who is a presumed parent under section -303(a)(1)(C) or (2) may only submit that individual's voluntary acknowledgment directly to the department of health.  The voluntary acknowledgment of parentage shall be in writing and shall consist of a single form signed under oath, by the individual who gave birth to the child, the individual seeking to establish a parent-child relationship, and a witness. The voluntary acknowledgment of parentage form shall include the social security numbers, dates of birth, places of birth, and ethnic backgrounds of each signatory.  An electronic version of the voluntary acknowledgment of parentage form may be used. (b)  Before the signing of the voluntary acknowledgment of parentage form, designated staff members of a facility at which a voluntary acknowledgment may be submitted shall provide to both the individual who gave birth to the child and the other signatory, if either are present at the facility: (1)  Written materials regarding parentage establishment; (2)  Forms necessary to voluntarily acknowledge parentage; (3)  Oral, video, audio, or written descriptions of the alternatives to, the legal consequences of, and the rights and responsibilities of acknowledging parentage, including, if one parent is a minor, any right afforded due to minority status; and (4)  The opportunity to speak with staff, either by telephone or in person, who are trained to clarify information and answer questions about parentage establishment. (c)  The completed voluntary acknowledgment forms shall clearly identify the name and position of the staff member who provides information to the parents regarding parentage establishment.  The provision by designated staff members of the facility of the information required by this section shall not constitute the unauthorized practice of law. Birthing hospital and birthing center staff, midwives, child support enforcement agency staff, and department of health staff shall not be subject to civil, criminal, or administrative liability for a negligent act or omission relative to the accuracy of the information provided or for filing the declaration with the appropriate state or local agencies.  Each facility shall send to the department of health the original acknowledgment of parentage form, or an electronic version, containing the social security numbers, dates of birth, places of birth, and ethnic backgrounds of both signatories, with any other information required by the department of health so that the birth certificate issued includes the names of the signatories.  The birth certificate shall be promptly recorded by the department of health. (d)  The child support enforcement agency shall: (1)  Provide to any individual or facility the necessary: (A)  Materials and forms and a written description of the rights and responsibilities related to voluntary acknowledgment of parentage; and (B)  Training, guidance, and written instructions regarding voluntary acknowledgment of parentage; (2)  Annually assess each facility's parentage establishment program; and (3)  Determine if a voluntary acknowledgment has been filed with the department of health whenever it receives an application for parentage establishment services. (e)  Notwithstanding sections 338-17.7 and 338-18(b), the department of health shall disclose to the child support enforcement agency, upon request, all voluntary acknowledgment of parentage forms on file with the department of health. (f)  The signed voluntary acknowledgment of parentage shall constitute a legal finding of parentage, subject to the right of any signatory to rescind the acknowledgment: (1)  Within sixty days of signature; or (2)  Before the date of an administrative or judicial proceeding relating to the child, including a proceeding to establish a support order to which the signatory is a party, whichever is sooner. (g)  Following the sixty-day period pursuant to subsection (f), a signed voluntary acknowledgment of parentage may be challenged in court only on the basis of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact, with the burden of proof on the challenger.  The legal responsibilities of any signatory arising from the acknowledgment, including child support obligations, shall not be suspended during the challenge, except for good cause shown. (h)  The courts and office of child support hearings of this State shall give full faith and credit to affidavits for the voluntary acknowledgment of parentage signed in any other state and made in compliance with the law of that state, and these affidavits shall constitute legal findings of parentage subject to subsections (f) and (g). (i)  Judicial and administrative proceedings shall not be required or permitted to ratify an unchallenged acknowledgment of parentage.  A voluntary acknowledgment of parentage signed by the individuals and filed with the department of health shall be the basis for establishing and enforcing a support obligation through a judicial or administrative proceeding. PART V. PROCEEDING TO ADJUDICATE PARENTAGE §   -501  Pretrial hearings.  (a)  As soon as practicable after an action to declare the existence or nonexistence of a parent-child relationship has been brought, an informal hearing shall be held.  The public shall be barred from the hearing.  A record of the proceeding or any portion thereof shall be kept if any party requests, or the court orders.  Rules of evidence need not be observed. (b)  The court, in its discretion, may waive a hearing on an uncontested parentage complaint submitted by an individual who gave birth to a child, an alleged genetic parent of the child, a presumed parent of the child, or a functional parent of the child with proof provided by affidavit. §   -502  Pretrial recommendations.  (a)  On the basis of the information produced at the pretrial hearing held pursuant to section -501, the judge conducting the hearing shall evaluate the probability of determining the existence or nonexistence of the parent-child relationship in a trial and whether a judicial declaration of the relationship would be in the best interest of the child pursuant to section 571-46(b).  On the basis of the evaluation, an appropriate recommendation for settlement shall be made to the parties, which may include any of the following: (1)  That the action be dismissed with or without prejudice; (2)  That the matter be compromised by an agreement among the birth parent and the individual who is seeking to have parentage adjudicated, and the child, in which the individual seeking to be adjudicated to be a parent is not adjudicated to be a parent but in which a defined economic obligation is undertaken in favor of the child and, if appropriate, in favor of the parent, subject to approval by the judge conducting the hearing.  In reviewing the obligation undertaken by the individual whose parentage is to be adjudicated in a compromise agreement, the judge conducting the hearing shall consider the best interest of the child, in light of the factors enumerated in section 576D‑7(a), discounted by the improbability, as it appears to the judge, of establishing the parentage or non-parentage of the individual whose parentage is to be adjudicated in a trial of the action; or (3)  That the individual whose parentage is to be adjudicated voluntarily acknowledges parentage of the child. (b)  If the parties accept a recommendation made in accordance with subsection (a), judgment shall be entered accordingly. (c)  If a party refuses to accept the final recommendation made under subsection (a) and genetic tests have not been taken, the court may order the parties to submit to genetic tests, if practicable.  Thereafter the judge shall make an appropriate final recommendation.  If a party refuses to accept the final recommendation, the action shall be set for trial. (d)  A guardian ad litem appointed for the child may accept or refuse to accept a recommendation under this section. (e)  The pretrial hearing may be terminated and the action set for trial if the judge conducting the hearing finds it unlikely that all parties would accept a recommendation the judge may make under subsection (a) or (c). §   -503  Civil action.  (a) An action under this chapter shall be a civil action governed by the Hawaii family court rules or the Hawaii rules of civil procedure.  The individual who gave birth to the child and the individual whose parentage is to be adjudicated shall be competent to testify and may be compelled to testify; provided that no criminal prosecution, other than a prosecution for perjury, shall afterwards be commenced against the individual who gave birth to the child or the individual whose parentage is to be adjudicated on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which they may testify or produce evidence under this chapter, documentary or otherwise.  Part VII shall apply in any action brought under this chapter. (b)  Testimony relating to sexual access to the individual who gave birth to the child by an unidentified person at any time or by an identified person at a time other than the probable time of conception of the child shall be inadmissible in evidence, unless offered by the individual who gave birth to the child. (c)  Notwithstanding the limitation on the admission of evidence stated in subsection (b), evidence offered with respect to an individual who is not subject to the jurisdiction of the court concerning sexual intercourse or assisted reproduction with the individual who gave birth to the child at or about the probable time of conception of the child shall be admissible in evidence only if the individual offering the evidence has undergone and made available to the court genetic tests, including genetic tests the results of which do not exclude the possibility of the individual's parentage of the child. §   -504  Judgment or order.  (a) The judgment or order of the court determining the existence or nonexistence of the parent-child relationship shall be determinative for all purposes. (b)  If the judgment or order of the court is at variance with the child's birth certificate, the court shall order that a new birth certificate be issued pursuant to section    -510. (c)  The judgment or order may contain any other provision directed against the appropriate party to the proceeding, concerning the duty of support, the custody and guardianship of the child, visitation privileges with the child, the furnishing of bond or other security for the payment of the judgment, or any other matter in the best interest of the child.  Upon neglect or refusal to give this security, or upon default of a parent or a parent's surety in compliance with the terms of the judgment, the court may order the forfeiture of the security and the application of the proceeds thereof toward the payment of any sums due under the terms of the judgment and may also sequester a parent's personal estate, and the rents and profits of a parent's real estate, and may appoint a receiver thereof, and may cause a parent's personal estate, including any salaries, wages, commissions, or other moneys owed to the parent and the rents and profits of the parent's real estate, to be applied toward the meeting of the terms of the judgment, to the extent that the court, from time to time, deems just and reasonable.  The judgment or order may direct a parent to pay the reasonable expenses of the pregnancy and childbirth, including but not limited to medical insurance premiums, such as for  MedQuest, that cover the periods of pregnancy and childbirth.  The court may further order the noncustodial parent to reimburse the custodial parent, the child, or any public agency for reasonable expenses incurred before entry of judgment, including support, maintenance, education, and funeral expenses expended for the benefit of the child. (d)  Support judgments or orders ordinarily shall be for periodic payments that may vary in amount.  In the best interest of the child, a lump sum payment or the purchase of an annuity may be ordered in lieu of periodic payments of support.  The court may limit the obligor parent's liability for past support of the child to the proportion of the expenses already incurred that the court deems just. (e)  In determining the amount to be paid by a parent for support of the child and the period during which the duty of support is owed, a court enforcing the obligation of support shall use the guidelines established under section 576D-7. Provision may be made for the support, maintenance, and education of an adult or minor child and an incompetent adult child, regardless of whether the petition is made before or after the child has attained the age of majority. (f)  Whenever a parent of a child is a minor, unmarried, and not able to provide full support, the court may order one or both parents of the minor to support the child until the minor reaches the age of majority, is otherwise emancipated, or is financially able to fully support the child, whichever occurs first.  For the purposes of this subsection: (1)  The judgment or order for support shall be made against the parent or parents of the minor to the extent that the minor is unable to support the child; (2)  The resources, standard of living, and earning ability of the parent or parents of the minor shall be considered under subsection (d) in determining the amount of support; and (3)  The parent or parents of the minor shall be an obligor under this chapter and chapter 571 and any action against the obligor to collect support may be pursued against the parent or parents of the minor. §   -505  Costs. The court may order reasonable fees of counsel, experts, and the child's guardian ad litem, and other costs of the action and pretrial proceedings, including genetic tests, subject to section -703, to be paid by the parties in proportions and at times determined by the court. §   -506  Enforcement of judgment or order.  (a) If existence of the parent-child relationship is declared, or parentage or a duty of support has been acknowledged or adjudicated under this chapter or under prior law, the obligation of a parent may be enforced in the same or other proceedings by the other parent, the child, the public authority that has furnished or may furnish the reasonable expenses of pregnancy, childbirth, education, support, or funeral, or by any other individual, including a private agency, to the extent the individual has furnished or is furnishing these expenses. (b)  The court may order support payments to be made to a parent or an adult child, or through the child support enforcement agency as its rules permit, or through an individual, corporation, or agency designated to administer support payments for the benefit of the child under the supervision of the court. (c)  Wilful failure to obey the judgment or order of the court shall be a civil contempt of the court.  All remedies for the enforcement of judgments shall apply to this chapter.  When a court of competent jurisdiction issues an order compelling a parent to furnish support, including child support, medical support, or other remedial care, for the parent's child, it shall constitute prima facie evidence of a civil contempt of court upon proof that: (1)  The order was made, filed, and served on the parent or proof that the parent was present in court at the time the order was pronounced; and (2)  The parent did not comply with the order. An order of civil contempt of court based on prima facie evidence under this subsection shall clearly state that the failure to comply with the order of civil contempt of court may subject the parent to a penalty that may include imprisonment or, if imprisonment is immediately ordered, the conditions that must be met for release from imprisonment. A party may also prove civil contempt of court by means other than prima facie evidence under this subsection. §   -507  Modification of judgment or order.  (a) The court shall have continuing jurisdiction to modify or revoke a judgment or order: (1)  For future education and support; and (2)  With respect to matters listed in section   ‑504(c) and (d) and    -506(b); provided that a court entering a judgment or order for the payment of a lump sum or the purchase of an annuity under section   -504(d) may specify that the judgment or order may not be modified or revoked. (b)  In those cases where child support payments are to continue due to the adult child's pursuance of education, the child support enforcement agency, at least three months before the adult child's nineteenth birthday, shall send notice by regular mail to the adult child and the custodial parent that prospective child support will be suspended unless proof is provided by the custodial parent or adult child, to the child support enforcement agency, before the child's nineteenth birthday, that the child is presently enrolled as a full-time student in school or has been accepted into and plans to attend a post-high school university, college, or vocational school as a full-time student for the next semester. If the custodial parent or adult child fails to do so, prospective child support payments may be automatically suspended by the child support enforcement agency, hearings officer, or court. In addition, if applicable, the child support enforcement agency, hearings officer, or court may issue an order terminating existing assignments against the responsible parent's income and income assignment orders. (c)  The need to provide for the child's health care needs through health insurance or other means shall be a basis for petitioning for a modification of the support order. §   -508  Hearings and records; confidentiality.  (a) Notwithstanding any other law concerning public hearings and records, unless the court orders otherwise, any hearing or trial in a case filed on or before January 1, 2021, under chapter 584, before its repeal, and any hearing or trial held to establish parentage under part VIII or IX shall be held in closed court without admittance of any individual other than those individuals necessary to the action or proceeding.  All papers and records pertaining to the action or proceeding, whether part of the permanent record of the court or of a file of the department of health or elsewhere shall not be open to inspection by any individual other than the parties to the proceeding, the child who is the subject of the proceeding, their attorneys, and the department of health, unless consent is given by the court and all interested persons, or inspection is authorized by an order of the court for good cause shown.  The individual seeking to inspect the document may be required to pay the expense of preparing a copy of the document to be inspected. (b)  Upon parentage being established, the confidentiality requirement shall not extend to the judgment and all subsequently filed documents that are used in good faith for support and medical expenses, insurance, or enforcement purposes; provided that the confidentiality requirement shall continue to apply to any references to a non-adjudicated alleged or presumed parent. §   -509  Court filings; minutes of proceedings; posting requirement.  The judiciary shall post on its website the titles of all court filings and the minutes of court proceedings in cases brought under this chapter except for actions filed pursuant to part VIII or IX; provided that the judiciary shall redact information that has been made confidential by any statute, rule of court, or court order; provided further that, on request of a party and for good cause, the court may close a proceeding and records to the public; provided further that the titles of all court filings for the case and the contents of a final order shall be available for public inspection, with other papers and records available for public inspection, only with the consent of the parties or by court order. §   -510  Birth records.  (a)  Upon order of a court of this State or upon request or order of a court of another state, or following acknowledgment as provided in section    -401, the department of health shall prepare a new birth certificate consistent with the findings of the court or in cases of acknowledgment under section    -401, consistent with the acknowledgment, and shall substitute the new birth certificate for the original birth certificate. (b)  The fact that a parent-child relationship was declared or acknowledged after the child's birth shall not be ascertainable from the new birth certificate, but the actual place and date of birth shall be shown. (c)  Unless the court orders otherwise, the evidence upon which the new birth certificate was made and the original birth certificate shall not be open to inspection by any individual other than the parties to the proceeding, the child who is the subject of the birth certificate, their attorneys, and the department of health.  A court shall only authorize an individual to inspect the evidence upon which the new birth certificate was made for good cause shown.  The individual seeking to inspect the document may be required to pay the expense of preparing a copy of the document to be inspected. §   -511  Parentage judgment, acknowledgment, support order; social security number.  The social security number of any individual who is subject to a parentage judgment or acknowledgment, or a support order issued under this chapter, shall be placed in the records relating to the matter in compliance with any other court rule or law. §   -512  Filing of acknowledgments and adjudications with department of health. All voluntary acknowledgments and adjudications of parentage by judicial process shall be filed with the department of health for comparison with information in the state case registry established pursuant to section 576D‑6(a)(12).  Filing of the adjudications of parentage shall be the responsibility of the natural parent or individual or agency as the court shall direct. PART VI.  SPECIAL RULES FOR PROCEEDINGS §   -601  Adjudicating parentage of child with alleged genetic parent.  (a)  A proceeding to determine whether an alleged genetic parent who is not a presumed parent is a parent of a child may be commenced: (1)  Before the child becomes an adult; or (2)  After the child becomes an adult, but only if the child initiates the proceeding. (b)  Except as otherwise provided by law, this subsection shall apply in a proceeding described in subsection (a) if the individual who gave birth to the child is the only other individual with a claim to parentage of the child.  The court shall adjudicate an alleged genetic parent to be a parent of the child if the alleged genetic parent: (1)  Is identified under section -705 as a genetic parent of the child and the identification is not successfully challenged under section    -705; (2)  Admits parentage in a pleading, when making an appearance, or during a hearing; the court accepts the admission; and the court determines the alleged genetic parent to be a parent of the child; (3)  Declines to submit to genetic testing ordered by the court or the child support enforcement agency, in which case the court may adjudicate the alleged genetic parent to be a parent of the child even if the alleged genetic parent denies a genetic relationship with the child; (4)  Is in default after service of process and the court determines the alleged genetic parent to be a parent of the child; or (5)  Is neither identified nor excluded as a genetic parent by genetic testing and, based on other evidence, the court determines the alleged genetic parent to be a parent of the child. (c)  If in a proceeding involving an alleged genetic parent at least one other individual in addition to the individual who gave birth to the child has a claim to parentage of the child, the court shall adjudicate parentage under section    -607, unless a valid denial of parentage is filed in accordance with section    -608. §   -602  Adjudicating parentage of child with presumed parent.  (a)  A proceeding to determine whether a presumed parent is a parent of a child may be commenced: (1)  Before the child becomes an adult; or (2)  After the child becomes an adult, but only if the child initiates the proceeding. (b)  A presumption of parentage under section -303 cannot be overcome after the child attains two years of age unless the court determines: (1)  The presumed parent is not a genetic parent, never resided with the child, and never held out the child as the presumed parent's child; or (2)  The child has more than one presumed parent. (c)  Except as otherwise provided by law, the following rules shall apply in a proceeding to adjudicate a presumed parent's parentage of a child if the individual who gave birth to the child is the only other individual with a claim to parentage of the child: (1)  If no party to the proceeding challenges the presumed parent's parentage of the child, the court shall adjudicate the presumed parent to be a parent of the child; (2)  If the presumed parent is identified under section    -705 as a genetic parent of the child and that identification is not successfully challenged under section     -705, the court shall adjudicate the presumed parent to be a parent of the child; and (3)  If the presumed parent is not identified under section    -705 as a genetic parent of the child and the presumed parent or the individual who gave birth to the child challenges the presumed parent's parentage of the child, the court shall adjudicate the parentage of the child in the best interest of the child based on the factors under sections    -607(a) and    -607(b). (d)  If in a proceeding to adjudicate a presumed parent's parentage of a child, another individual in addition to the individual who gave birth to the child asserts a claim to parentage of the child, the court shall adjudicate parentage under section    -607, unless a valid denial of parentage is filed in accordance with section -608. §   -603  Adjudicating claim of functional parentage of a child.  (a)  A proceeding to establish parentage of a child under this section may be commenced only by an individual who: (1)  Is alive when the proceeding is commenced; and (2)  Claims to be a functional parent of the child. (b)  An individual who claims to be a functional parent of a child shall commence a proceeding to establish parentage of a child under this section: (1)  Before the child attains eighteen years of age; and (2)  While the child is alive. (c)  The following rules shall govern standing of an individual who claims to be a functional parent of a child to maintain a proceeding under this section: (1)  The individual shall file an initial verified pleading alleging specific facts that support the claim to parentage of the child asserted under this section. The verified pleading shall be served on all parents and legal guardians of the child and any other party to the proceeding; (2)  An adverse party, parent, or legal guardian may file a pleading in response to the pleading filed under paragraph (1).  A responsive pleading shall be verified and must be served on parties to the proceeding; and (3)  Unless the court finds a hearing is necessary to determine disputed facts material to the issue of standing, the court shall determine, based on the pleadings under paragraphs (1) and (2), whether the individual has alleged facts sufficient to satisfy by a preponderance of the evidence the requirements of subsection (d).  If the court holds a hearing under this subsection, the hearing shall be held on an expedited basis. (d)  In a proceeding to adjudicate parentage of an individual who claims to be a functional parent of the child, if there is only one other individual who is a parent or has a claim to parentage of the child, the court shall adjudicate the individual who claims to be a functional parent to be a parent of the child if the individual demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that: (1)  The individual resided with the child as a regular member of the child's household for a significant period; (2)  The individual engaged in consistent caretaking of the child; (3)  The individual undertook full and permanent responsibilities of a parent of the child without expectation of financial compensation; (4)  The individual held out the child as the individual's child; (5)  The individual established a bonded and dependent relationship with the child that is parental in nature; (6)  Another parent of the child fostered or supported the bonded and dependent relationship required under paragraph (5); and (7)  Continuing the relationship between the individual and the child is in the best interest of the child. (e)  Subject to other limitations in this part, if in a proceeding to adjudicate parentage of an individual who claims to be a functional parent of the child, there is more than one other individual who is a parent or has a claim to parentage of the child and the court determines that the requirements of subsection (d) are satisfied, the court shall adjudicate parentage under section    -607, unless a valid denial of parentage is filed in accordance with section    -608. §   -604  Adjudicating parentage of child with acknowledged parent.  (a)  If a child has an acknowledged parent, a proceeding to challenge the acknowledgment of parentage, brought by a signatory to the acknowledgment, shall be governed by section    -403(g). (b)  If a child has an acknowledged parent, the following rules shall apply in a proceeding to challenge the acknowledgment of parentage brought by an individual, other than the child, who has standing under section    -203 and was not a signatory to the acknowledgment: (1)  The individual shall commence the proceeding no later than two years after the effective date of the acknowledgment, unless good cause is shown; (2)  The court may permit the proceeding only if the court finds permitting the proceeding is in the best interest of the child pursuant to section 571-46(b); and (3)  If the court permits the proceeding, the court shall adjudicate parentage under section    -607. §   -605  Adjudicating parentage of child with adjudicated parent.  (a)  If a child has an adjudicated parent, a proceeding to challenge the adjudication, brought by an individual who was a party to the adjudication or received notice under section -201, shall be governed by the rules governing a collateral attack on a judgment. (b)  If a child has an adjudicated parent, the following rules shall apply to a proceeding to challenge the adjudication of parentage brought by an individual, other than the child, who has standing under section    -203 and was not a party to the adjudication and did not receive notice under section    -201: (1)  The individual shall commence the proceeding no later than two years after the effective date of the adjudication, unless good cause is shown; (2)  The court may permit the proceeding only if the court finds permitting the proceeding is in the best interest of the child pursuant to section 571-46(b); and (3)  If the court permits the proceeding, the court shall adjudicate parentage under section    -607. §   -606  Adjudicating parentage of a child of assisted reproduction.  (a)  An individual who is a parent under part VIII or the individual who gave birth to the child may bring a proceeding to adjudicate parentage.  If the court determines the individual is a parent under part VIII, the court shall adjudicate the individual to be a parent of the child. (b)  In a proceeding to adjudicate an individual's parentage of a child under this section, if another individual other than the individual who gave birth to the child is a parent under part VIII, the court shall adjudicate the individual's parentage of the child under section -607. §   -607  Adjudicating competing claims of parentage.  (a) Except as otherwise provided by law, in a proceeding to adjudicate competing claims of, or challenges under section    ‑601,    ‑602, -603,    -604,    -605, or -606 to, parentage of a child by two or more individuals, the court shall adjudicate parentage in the best interest of the child, based on: (1)  The age of the child; (2)  The length of time during which each individual assumed the role of parent of the child; (3)  The nature of the relationship between the child and each individual; (4)  The harm to the child if the relationship between the child and each individual is not recognized; (5)  The basis for each individual's claim to parentage of the child; and (6)  Other equitable factors arising from the disruption of the relationship between the child and each individual or the likelihood of other harm to the child. (b)  If an individual challenges parentage based on the results of genetic testing, in addition to the factors listed in subsection (a), the court shall consider: (1)  The facts surrounding the discovery that the individual might not be a genetic parent of the child; and (2)  The length of time between the time that the individual was placed on notice that the individual might not be a genetic parent and the commencement of the proceeding. (c)  The court may adjudicate a child to have more than two parents under this chapter if the court finds that failure to recognize more than two parents would be detrimental to the child.  A finding of detriment to the child shall not require a finding of unfitness of any parent or individual seeking an adjudication of parentage.  In determining detriment to the child, the court shall consider all relevant factors, including the harm if the child is removed from a stable placement with an individual who has fulfilled the child's physical needs and psychological needs for care and affection and has assumed the role for a substantial period. §   -608  Denial of parentage.  An alleged genetic parent or presumed parent may sign a denial of parentage in a record filed with the court.  The denial of parentage shall be valid only if: (1)  Another individual other than the individual who gave birth to the child agrees to have that other individual's parentage of the child established under this part, and the agreement is in an affidavit filed with the court; (2)  The signature of the alleged genetic parent or presumed parent is attested by a notarial officer or witnesses; and (3)  The alleged genetic parent or presumed parent has not previously: (A)  Completed a valid acknowledgment of parentage, unless the previous acknowledgment was rescinded under section -403(f) or challenged successfully under section -403(g); or (B)  Been adjudicated to be a parent of the child. PART VII. GENETIC TESTING §   -701  Scope of part; limitation on use of genetic testing.  (a)  This part shall govern genetic testing of an individual in a proceeding to adjudicate parentage, whether the individual: (1)  Voluntarily submits to testing; or (2)  Is tested under an order of the court or the child support enforcement agency. (b)  Genetic testing shall not be used to: (1)  Challenge the parentage of an individual who is a parent under part VIII or IX; or (2)  Establish the parentage of an individual who is a donor. §   -702  Authority to order or deny genetic testing.  (a) Except as otherwise provided in this part or part V, in a proceeding under this chapter to determine parentage, the court shall order the child and any other individual to submit to genetic testing if a request for testing is supported by the sworn statement of a party: (1)  Alleging a reasonable possibility that the individual is the child's genetic parent; or (2)  Denying genetic parentage of the child and stating facts establishing a reasonable possibility that the individual is not a genetic parent. (b)  The child support enforcement agency may order genetic testing only if there is no presumed parent, acknowledged parent, or adjudicated parent of a child other than the individual who gave birth to the child. (c)  The court or the child support enforcement agency shall not order in utero genetic testing. (d)  If two or more individuals are subject to court‑ordered genetic testing, the court may order that testing be completed concurrently or sequentially. (e)  Genetic testing of an individual who gave birth to a child shall not be a condition precedent to testing of the child and an individual whose genetic parentage of the child is being determined.  If the individual who gave birth to the child is unavailable or declines to submit to genetic testing, the court may order genetic testing of the child and each individual whose genetic parentage of the child is being adjudicated. (f)  In a proceeding to adjudicate the parentage of a child having a presumed parent or an individual who claims to be a parent under section    -602, or to challenge an acknowledgment of parentage, the court may deny a motion for genetic testing of the child and any other individual after considering the factors in section -607(a) and (b). (g)  If an individual requesting genetic testing is barred under section    -402(a),    -403(g), -604(b), or    -605(b) from establishing the individual's parentage, the court shall deny the request for genetic testing. (h)  An order under this section for genetic testing shall be enforceable by contempt. §   -703  Requirements for genetic testing.  (a) Genetic testing shall be of a type reasonably relied on by experts in the field of genetic testing and performed in a testing laboratory accredited by: (1)  The AABB, formerly known as the American Association of Blood Banks, or a successor to its functions; or (2)  An accrediting body designated by the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. (b)  A specimen used in genetic testing may consist of a sample or a combination of samples of blood, buccal cells, bone, hair, or other body tissue or fluid.  The specimen used in the testing need not be of the same kind for each individual undergoing genetic testing. (c)  Based on the ethnic or racial group of an individual undergoing genetic testing, a testing laboratory shall determine the databases from which to select frequencies for use in calculating a relationship index.  If an individual or the child support enforcement agency objects to the laboratory's choice, the following rules shall apply: (1)  No later than thirty days after receipt of the report of the test, the objecting individual or the child support enforcement agency may request the court to require the laboratory to recalculate the relationship index using an ethnic or racial group different from that used by the laboratory; (2)  The individual or the child support enforcement agency objecting to the laboratory's choice under this subsection shall: (A)  If the requested frequencies are not available to the laboratory for the ethnic or racial group requested, provide the requested frequencies compiled in a manner recognized by accrediting bodies; or (B)  Engage another laboratory to perform the calculations; and (3)  The laboratory may use its own statistical estimate if there is a question as to which ethnic or racial group is appropriate.  The laboratory shall calculate the frequencies using statistics, if available, for any other ethnic or racial group requested. (d)  If, after recalculation of the relationship index under subsection (c) using a different ethnic or racial group, genetic testing under section    -705 does not identify an individual as a genetic parent of a child, the court may require an individual who has been tested to submit to additional genetic testing to identify a genetic parent. §   -704  Report of genetic testing.  (a)  In any hearing or trial brought under this chapter, a report of the facts and results of genetic tests ordered by the court under this chapter shall be admissible in evidence by affidavit of the person whose name is signed to the report, attesting to the procedures followed in obtaining the report.  A report of the facts and results of genetic tests shall be admissible as evidence of parentage without the need for foundation testimony or other proof of authenticity or accuracy, unless objection is made. (b)  Documentation from a testing laboratory of the following information shall be sufficient to establish a reliable chain of custody and allow the results of genetic testing to be admissible without testimony: (1)  The name and photograph of each individual whose specimen has been taken; (2)  The name of the individual who collected each specimen; (3)  The place and date each specimen was collected; (4)  The name of the individual who received each specimen in the testing laboratory; and (5)  The date each specimen was received. (c)  An alleged genetic parent or party to the parentage action who objects to the admission of the report concerning the genetic test results shall file a motion no later than twenty days after receiving a copy of the report and shall show good cause as to why a witness is necessary to lay the foundation for the admission of the report as evidence.  The court may, sua sponte or at a hearing on the motion, determine whether a witness shall be required to lay the foundation for the admission of the report as evidence.  The right to call witnesses to rebut the report shall be reserved to all parties. §   -705  Report of genetic testing.  (a) Subject to a challenge under subsection (b), an individual is identified under this chapter as a genetic parent of a child if genetic testing complies with this part and the results of the testing disclose: (1)  The individual has at least a ninety-nine per cent probability of parentage, using a prior probability of 0.50, as calculated by using the combined relationship index obtained in the testing; and (2)  A combined relationship index of at least one hundred to one. (b)  An individual identified under subsection (a) as a genetic parent of the child may challenge the genetic testing results only by other genetic testing satisfying the requirements of this part that: (1)  Excludes the individual as a genetic parent of the child; or (2)  Identifies another individual as a possible genetic parent of the child other than the individual: (A)  Who gave birth to the child; or (B)  Identified under subsection (a). (c)  If more than one individual other than the individual who gave birth is identified by genetic testing as a possible genetic parent of the child, the court shall order each individual to submit to further genetic testing to identify a genetic parent. (d)  If an original test result is contested, the court shall order further genetic testing with payment of the testing to be advanced and paid for by the contesting party. §   -706  Genetic testing when specimen not available.  (a) Subject to subsection (b), if a genetic-testing specimen is not available from an alleged genetic parent of a child, an individual seeking genetic testing demonstrates good cause, and the court finds that the circumstances are just, the court may order any of the following individuals to submit specimens for genetic testing: (1)  A parent of the alleged genetic parent; (2)  A sibling of the alleged genetic parent; (3)  Another child of the alleged genetic parent and the individual who gave birth to the other child; and (4)  Another relative of the alleged genetic parent necessary to complete genetic testing. (b)  To issue an order under this section, the court shall find that a need for genetic testing outweighs the legitimate interests of the individual sought to be tested. §   -707  Deceased individual.  If an individual seeking genetic testing demonstrates good cause, the court may order genetic testing of a deceased individual. PART VIII.  ASSISTED REPRODUCTION §   -801  Scope of part.  This part shall not apply to the birth of a child conceived by sexual intercourse or assisted reproduction under a surrogacy agreement under part IX. §   -802  Parental status of donor.  A donor is not a parent of a child conceived by assisted reproduction. §   -803  Parentage of child of assisted reproduction.  An individual who consents under section -804 to assisted reproduction by another individual with the intent to be a parent of a child conceived by the assisted reproduction is a parent of the child. §   -804  Consent to assisted reproduction.  (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), the consent described in section    -803 shall be in a record signed by an individual giving birth to a child conceived by assisted reproduction and the other individual who intends to be a parent of the child. (b)  Failure to consent in a record as required by subsection (a), before, on, or after the birth of the child shall not preclude the court from finding consent to parentage if: (1)  The individual giving birth to a child or the other individual proves by clear and convincing evidence the existence of an express agreement entered into before conception that the individual giving birth and the other individual intended they both would be parents of the child; or (2)  The individual giving birth to the child and the other individual for the first two years of the child's life, including any period of temporary absence, resided together in the same household with the child and both openly held out the child as the individual's child; provided that if an individual dies or becomes incapacitated before the child attains two years of age or the child dies before the child attains two years of age, the court may find consent under this subsection to parentage if a party proves by clear and convincing evidence that the individual giving birth to the child and the other individual intended to reside together in the same household with the child and both intended the individual would openly hold out the child as the individual's child, but the individual was prevented from carrying out that intent by death or incapacity. §   -805  Limitation on spouse's dispute of parentage.  (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), an individual who, at the time of the child's birth, is the spouse of an individual who gave birth to the child by assisted reproduction may not challenge the individual's own parentage of the child unless: (1)  No later than two years after the birth of the child or the date of which the individual first learns of the birth of the child, whichever is later, the individual commences a proceeding to adjudicate the individual's parentage of the child; and (2)  The court finds the individual did not consent to the assisted reproduction, before, on, or after the birth of the child, or withdrew consent under section   ‑807. (b)  A proceeding to adjudicate a spouse's parentage of a  child born by assisted reproduction may be commenced at any time if the court determines: (1)  The spouse neither provided a gamete for, nor consented to, the assisted reproduction; (2)  The spouse and the individual who gave birth to the child have not cohabited since the probable time of assisted reproduction; and (3)  The spouse never openly held out the child as the spouse's child. (c)  This section shall apply to a spouse's dispute of parentage even if the spouse's marriage is declared invalid after assisted reproduction occurs. §   -806  Effect of certain legal proceedings regarding marriage.  If a marriage of an individual who gives birth to a child conceived by assisted reproduction is terminated through divorce or dissolution, subject to legal separation or separate maintenance, declared invalid, or annulled before transfer of gametes or embryos to said individual, a former spouse of said individual is not a parent of the child unless the former spouse consented in a record that the former spouse would be a parent of the child if assisted reproduction were to occur after a divorce, dissolution, legal separation, separate maintenance, declaration of invalidity, or annulment, and the former spouse did not withdraw consent under section    -807. §   -807  Withdrawal of consent.  (a)  An individual who consents under section    -804 to assisted reproduction may withdraw consent any time before a transfer by giving notice in a record of the withdrawal of consent to the individual who agreed to give birth to a child conceived by assisted reproduction and to any fertility clinic or health care provider facilitating the assisted reproduction.  Failure to give notice to the fertility clinic or health care provider shall not affect a determination of parentage under this part. (b)  An individual who withdraws consent under subsection (a) is not a parent of the child under this part. §   -808  Parental status of deceased individual.  (a)  If an individual who intends to be a parent of a child conceived by assisted reproduction dies during the period between the transfer of a gamete or embryo and the birth of the child, the individual's death shall not preclude the establishment of the individual's parentage of the child if the individual otherwise would be a parent of the child under this chapter. (b)  If an individual who consented in a record to assisted reproduction by an individual who agreed to give birth to a child dies before a transfer of gametes or embryos, the deceased individual is a parent of a child conceived by the assisted reproduction only if: (1)  Either: (A)  The individual consented in a record that if assisted reproduction were to occur after the death of the individual, the individual would be a parent of the child; or (B)  The individual's intent to be a parent of a child conceived by assisted reproduction after the individual's death is established by clear and convincing evidence; and (2)  Either: (A)  The embryo is in utero no later than thirty-six months after the individual's death; or (B)  The child is born no later than forty-five months after the individual's death. PART IX. SURROGACY AGREEMENT A. General Provisions §   -901  Definitions.  As used in this part: "Genetic surrogate" means an individual who is capable of carrying a pregnancy to term and giving birth to a child, who is not an intended parent and who agrees to become pregnant through assisted reproduction using the individual's own gamete, under a genetic surrogacy agreement as provided in this part. "Gestational surrogate" means an individual who is capable of carrying a pregnancy to term and giving birth to a child, who is not an intended parent and who agrees to become pregnant through assisted reproduction using gametes that are not the individual's own, under a gestational surrogacy agreement as provided in this part.

(f)  Except as otherwise provided in subsections (g), (i), and (j), and unless a parent-child relationship is established under subsection (d) or (e), a parent-child relationship shall be deemed to exist between a child of assisted reproduction and an individual other than the birth mother who consented to assisted reproduction by the birth mother with the intent to be treated as the other parent of the child.  Consent to assisted reproduction by the birth mother with intent to be treated as the other parent of the child shall be established if the individual: (1)  Signed a record, before or after the child's birth, that, considering all the facts and circumstances, evidences the individual's consent; or (2)  In the absence of a signed record under paragraph (1): (A)  Functioned as a parent of the child no later than two years after the child's birth; (B)  Intended to function as a parent of the child no later than two years after the child's birth but was prevented from carrying out that intent by death, incapacity, or other circumstances; or (C)  Intended to be treated as a parent of a posthumously conceived child, if that intent is established by clear and convincing evidence. (g)  For the purpose of subsection (f)(1), neither an individual who signed a record more than two years after the birth of the child, nor a relative of that individual who is not also a relative of the birth mother, inherits from or through the child unless the individual functioned as a parent of the child before the child reached eighteen years of age.

(i)  If a married couple is divorced before placement of eggs, sperm, or embryos, a child resulting from the assisted reproduction shall not be treated as a child of the birth mother's former spouse, unless the former spouse consented in a record that, if assisted reproduction were to occur after divorce, the child would be treated as the former spouse's child. (j)  If, in a record, an individual withdraws consent to assisted reproduction before placement of eggs, sperm, or embryos, a child resulting from the assisted reproduction shall not be treated as a child of that individual, unless the individual subsequently satisfies subsection (f). (k)  If, under this section, an individual is a parent of a child of assisted reproduction who is conceived after the individual's death, the child shall be treated as in gestation at the individual's death for purposes of section 560:2-104(b)(2) if the child is: (1)  In utero no later than thirty-six months after the individual's death; or (2)  Born no later than forty-five months after the individual's death.] Except as otherwise provided under section 560:2-127, parentage of an individual conceived by assisted reproduction shall be determined under part VIII of chapter    , other than section    -808(b)(2)."

(d)  A parent, guardian, or next friend of a child whose legal custody has been transferred by the court to an institution, facility, agency, or person may petition the court for modification or revocation of the decree, on the ground that the legal custodian has wrongfully denied application for the release of the child or has failed to act upon it within a reasonable time, or has acted in an arbitrary manner not consistent with the welfare of the child or the public interest. An institution, facility, agency, or person vested with legal custody of a child may petition the court for a renewal, modification, or revocation of the custody order on the ground that the change is necessary for the welfare of the child or in the public interest.  The court may dismiss the petition if on preliminary investigation it finds the petition without substance.  If the court is of the opinion that the decree should be reviewed, it shall conduct a hearing on notice to all parties concerned, and may enter an order continuing, modifying, or terminating the decree.
