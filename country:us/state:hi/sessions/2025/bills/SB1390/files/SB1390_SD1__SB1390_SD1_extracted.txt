BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the department of education is responsible for submitting out an annual computer science legislative report by June 30 every year.  However, the department of education has recommended the inclusion of quarter four computer science data from the schools in the report, and the current June 30 due date prohibits the inclusion of that data.  Thus, the department of education prefers to delay the due date for the report to the end of the calendar year to provide a more robust computer science report.
