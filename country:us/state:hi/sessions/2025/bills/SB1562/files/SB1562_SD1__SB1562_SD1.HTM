SB1562 SD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1562 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO AGRICULTURE. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the high cost of agricultural land and housing in Hawaii presents significant barriers to individuals, particularly young and aspiring farmers, seeking to engage in bona fide agricultural activities. Traditional market dynamics often place land ownership and affordable housing out of reach, thereby hindering efforts to promote local food production and sustainable farming practices. The legislature further finds that a combined housing operational agriculture mobilization program, based upon proven strengths of community land trusts, which have successfully provided affordable housing in perpetuity by separating land ownership from housing ownership, can help to address Hawaii's need for housing and agriculture. The legislature also finds that offering secure, long-term access to land and affordable housing will: (1)  Empower new and young farmers by lowering financial barriers, encouraging a new generation of agricultural entrepreneurs; (2)  Promote sustainable agriculture, enabling investment in regenerative practices that enhance environmental stewardship; (3)  Strengthen local economies by supporting local food production and creating agricultural employment opportunities; and (4)  Ensure perpetual affordability by separating land ownership from housing ownership and implementing resale restrictions. This Act is declared a matter of statewide concern to preserve Hawaii's agricultural heritage, promote sustainable development, and ensure the viability of the agricultural sector. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish the combined housing operational agriculture mobilization program to provide both housing and farming opportunities to individuals engaged in bona fide agricultural activities. SECTION 2.  The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to title 11 to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Chapter COMBINED HOUSING OPERATIONAL AGRICULTURE MOBILIZATION §   -1  Definitions.
