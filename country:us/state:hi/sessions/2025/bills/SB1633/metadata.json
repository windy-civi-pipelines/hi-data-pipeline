Allows any hemp processor with a permit from the Department of Health to sell an edible or beverage cannabinoid product that contains a tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 2.5 milligrams per serving and not more than twenty-five servings per package.  Prohibits the sale of an edible or beverage cannabinoid product to any person less than twenty-one years of age.  Establishes child-resistant packaging requirements for edible cannabinoid products.  Clarifies the tetrahydrocannabinol concentration limit for a non-edible legacy cannabinoid product or manufactured hemp product shall be subject only to federal restrictions.  Amends the definition of \"hemp biomass\" to include stalks and foliage material.  Requires the Department of Health to establish a dedicated hemp program to regulate hemp that is separate from the regulatory process for cannabinoid products with a high concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol.  Effective 7/1/2050.  (SD1)"
