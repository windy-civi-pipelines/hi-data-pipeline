Section 1:
HB1227 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1227 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO FAMILY LEAVE. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii's working families are not adequately supported during times of caregiving and illness.  According to the 2022 Aloha United Way ALICE (Asset Limited Income Constrained Employed) Facts and Figures, nearly half of Hawaii families would not have enough money to cover expenses for four weeks.  An unexpected medical emergency would put families under significant financial strain.  While the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 allows twelve weeks of unpaid leave to employees who have worked at a business that employs fifty or more employees, the majority of Hawaii's workforce cannot afford to take unpaid leave to care for a new child or attend to the needs of a family member with a serious health condition. In Hawaii, 247,000 people serve as family caregivers.  Hawaii has the fastest growing population over the age of sixty-five in the nation, and that number is expected to grow by eighty-one per cent by the year 2030.  Nearly a third of those who need but do not have access to family leave will need the time off to care for a family member experiencing serious illness or requiring end-of-life care.  Women, as primary caregivers of infants, children, and elderly parents, are affected disproportionately by the absence of paid family and medical leave.  Further, father-infant bonding is important in the emotional, social, cognitive, and physical development of the newborn baby. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that state and county employees are provided family leave insurance benefits during times when they need to provide care for their families. SECTION 2.  Chapter 78, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part     .  Paid family leave §78-A  Definitions.  As used in this part, unless the context otherwise requires: "Child" means an individual who is a biological, adopted, hanai, or foster son or daughter; a stepchild; a legal ward of an employee; a grandchild; a child of a reciprocal beneficiary; or a child of an employee who stands in loco parentis. "Health care provider" means a physician as defined under section 386-1. "Parent" means a biological, foster, hanai or adoptive parent, a parent-in-law, a stepparent, a legal guardian, a grandparent, a grandparent-in-law, a parent or grandparent of a reciprocal beneficiary, or a person who stands in loco parentis for a minor child. "Qualified employee" means an employee who has completed at least 1,250 hours of service over at least twelve months of service as an employee. "Reduced leave schedule" means a leave schedule that reduces the usual number of hours per workweek or hours per workday of a qualified employee. "Serious health condition" means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves: (1)  Inpatient care at a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility; or (2)  Continuing treatment by a health care provider. "Sibling" means an individual who is a biological, adopted, hanai, or foster brother or sister; or a stepbrother or stepsister of an employee. §78-B Paid family leave; general requirements.  (a)  A qualified employee shall be entitled to a total of twelve weeks of paid leave during any twelve-month period for one or more of the following: (1)  The birth of a child of the qualified employee and in order to care for the child; (2)  The placement of a child with the qualified employee for adoption or foster care; or (3)  To care for the qualified employee's spouse, reciprocal beneficiary, child, grandchild, parent, or sibling if the spouse, reciprocal beneficiary, child, grandchild, parent, sibling, or a service member who is the qualified employees next of kin has a serious health condition. (b) The entitlement to leave under subsection (a)(1) or (2) shall expire at the end of the twelve-month period beginning on the date of birth or placement of the child.

(e) A qualified employee taking leave under this section may elect to use one of the following types of paid leave: (1)  Twelve administrative workweeks of paid family leave under this paragraph in connection with the birth or placement involved; or (2)  During the twelve-month period referred to in subsection (a), and in addition to the twelve administrative workweeks under paragraph (1), any leave accrued or accumulated by the qualified employee; provided that nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require that a qualified employee first use all or any portion of the leave described in paragraph (2) before being allowed to use the paid parental leave described in paragraph (1); provided further that nothing in this section shall require an employer to provide paid sick leave in any situation in which the employer would not normally provide paid leave. (f)  Paid family leave taken under subsection (e)(1): (1)  Shall be payable from any appropriation or fund available for salaries or expenses for positions within the employing agency; (2)  Shall not be considered to be vacation leave or any other type of leave; and (3)  If not used by the qualified employee before the end of the twelve-month period described in subsection (a) to which it relates, shall not accumulate for any subsequent use. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to modify the requirement that the qualified employee complete at least twelve months of service as an employee, as described in the definition of "qualified employee" in section 78-A, before becoming eligible to take leave pursuant to this part. (g) A qualified employee shall not take leave under subsection (e)(1) unless the qualified employee agrees in writing, before the leave commences, to work for the applicable employing agency for not less than a period of twelve weeks beginning on the date the leave concludes; provided that: (1)  The head of the agency shall waive this requirement in any instance where the qualified employee is unable to return to work because of the continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition, including a mental health condition, related to the applicable birth or placement of a child of the qualified employee or the child; and (2)  The head of the employing agency may require that a qualified employee who claims to be unable to return to work because of a health condition described under paragraph (1) provide certification supporting that claim by the health care provider of the qualified employee or the child, as the case may be.  The qualified employee shall provide the certification to the head in a timely manner. (h) If a qualified employee fails to return from paid leave provided under subsection (e)(1) after the date the leave concludes, the employing agency may recover from the qualified employee an amount equal to the total amount of government contributions paid by the agency on behalf of the qualified employee for maintaining the qualified employee's health coverage during the period of the leave; provided that this subsection shall not apply to a qualified employee who fails to return from leave due to: (1)  The continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition as described under, and consistent with the requirements of, subsection (g); or (2)  Any other circumstance beyond the control of the qualified employee.
