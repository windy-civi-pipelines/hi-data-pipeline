SB1526 CD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1526 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 1 C.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE DRUG AND ALCOHOL TOXICOLOGY TESTING LABORATORY. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the establishment of a state laboratory for drug and alcohol testing is crucial to ensuring the health and safety of the State's communities.  This effort requires close coordination between the department of health and county governments to create a facility that can deliver timely, accurate, and reliable toxicology testing services statewide.  The department of transportation recognizes the critical importance of implementing consistent standards and practices across the State to ensure the laboratory meets the needs of all counties effectively.  To achieve this, additional time is necessary to build, equip, and establish the laboratory, along with the administrative framework to support its operations. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to extend the timeline for the establishment and maintenance of the drug and alcohol toxicology testing laboratory. SECTION 2. Act 148, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023, is amended by amending section 13 to read as follows: "SECTION 13.  Any provision of this Act to the contrary notwithstanding, the [appropriation] appropriations for fiscal year 2023-2024 and fiscal year 2024-2025 authorized under section 12 of this Act shall not lapse at the end of the fiscal year for which the appropriation is made; provided that all moneys from the [appropriation] appropriations that are unencumbered as of [June 30, 2025,] June 30, 2028, shall lapse to the credit of the state highway fund as of that date." SECTION 3. Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 4. This Act shall take effect on June 29, 2025.
