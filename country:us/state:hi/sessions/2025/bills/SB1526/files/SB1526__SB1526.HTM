BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the establishment of a state laboratory for drug and alcohol testing is crucial to ensuring the health and safety of our communities.  This effort requires close coordination between the department of health and county governments to create a facility that can deliver timely, accurate, and reliable toxicology testing services statewide.  The department of transportation recognizes the critical importance of implementing consistent standards and practices across the state to ensure the laboratory meets the needs of all counties effectively.  To achieve this, additional time is necessary to build, equip, and establish the laboratory, along with the administrative framework to support its operations.
