Section 1:
HB959 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 959 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to taxation. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1. The legislature finds that tax equity is a cornerstone of economic prosperity.  According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, Hawaii places the second-highest tax burden on low-income households, with the State's lowest-income households paying approximately fifteen per cent of their income in state and local taxes.  In comparison, the State's highest earning households pay approximately nine per cent of their income in state and local taxes. The legislature further finds that the State's cost of living continues to be burdensome for residents.  According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition's "Out of Reach 2023" report, a minimum wage employee must work one hundred seven hours per week to afford a one-bedroom rental home at fair market prices.  To afford a two-bedroom residence without being cost burdened, the National Low Income Housing Coalition estimates that a person must earn $41.83 per hour. In addition to the rising cost of housing, the costs of utilities, groceries, and other everyday items have also increased significantly within the last five years.  Rising costs of these essential items can also increase the burden on lower-income families.  Eliminating the general excise tax on groceries and nonprescription drugs, for example, could ease the tax burden on residents, especially lower-income households. Further, money saved from a lower tax burden can be spent elsewhere in the local economy, creating a circular effect that will help many individuals and families statewide. The legislature additionally finds that on August 8, 2023, wildfires swept across Maui and killed at least one hundred two people, making it one of the deadliest natural disasters in United States history. The 2023 Maui wildfires destroyed over two thousand two hundred structures, including homes and businesses. Rebuilding after the devastating impacts of the wildfires on the island of Maui could cost more than $5 billion, according to a preliminary assessment prepared by the university of Hawaii pacific disaster center and local officials. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Exempt the sale of groceries and nonprescription drugs from the general excise tax; (2)  Incrementally increase the general excise tax over four years to six per cent, with the increased proceeds during certain fiscal years to be deposited into the general fund; (3)  Remove the state income tax on unemployment compensation benefits; (4)  Double the standard deduction for individuals earning less than $100,000 and joint returns earning less than $200,000; (5)  Repeal the incremental increases on standard income tax deduction amounts; (6)  Increase the minimum income threshold exemption amount for the low-income household renters' income tax credit; (7)  Remove the tax liability for the first $100,000 of individual income earned; and (8)  Establish a Maui recovery special fund for the impacts related to the 2023 Maui wildfires. PART II SECTION 2.  Chapter 237, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding two new sections to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§237-    Exemption for groceries.  There shall be exempted from, and excluded from the measure of, the taxes imposed by this chapter all of the gross proceeds or gross income received or derived from the sale of groceries. For purposes of this section, "groceries" means products eligible to be purchased with the United States Department of Agriculture's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits. §237-    Exemption for nonprescription drugs.  (a) There shall be exempted from, and excluded from the measure of, the taxes imposed by this chapter all of the gross proceeds or gross income received or derived from the sale of nonprescription drugs. (b)  For the purposes of this section: "Drug" means: (1)  Articles recognized in the official United States Pharmacopoeia, official United States Pharmacopoeia Dispensing Information, official Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States, or official National Formulary, or any supplement to any of these publications; (2)  Articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in humans or animals; (3)  Articles, other than food or clothing, intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of humans or animals; or (4)  Articles intended for use as a component of any article specified in paragraphs (1) through (3); provided that the term "drug" does not include devices or their components, parts or accessories, cosmetics, or liquor as defined in section 281-1. "Nonprescription drug" means any packaged, bottled, or nonbulk chemical, drug, or medicine that may be lawfully sold without a practitioner's order." PART III SECTION 3.  Section 237-13, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§237-13  Imposition of tax.  There is hereby levied and shall be assessed and collected annually privilege taxes against persons on account of their business and other activities in the State measured by the application of rates against values of products, gross proceeds of sales, or gross income, whichever is specified, as follows: (1)  Tax on manufacturers. (A)  Upon every person engaging or continuing within the State in the business of manufacturing, including compounding, canning, preserving, packing, printing, publishing, milling, processing, refining, or preparing for sale, profit, or commercial use, either directly or through the activity of others, in whole or in part, any article or articles, substance or substances, commodity or commodities, the amount of the tax to be equal to the value of the articles, substances, or commodities, manufactured, compounded, canned, preserved, packed, printed, milled, processed, refined, or prepared for sale, as shown by the gross proceeds derived from the sale thereof by the manufacturer or person compounding, preparing, or printing them, multiplied by one-half of one per cent. (B)  The measure of the tax on manufacturers is the value of the entire product for sale. (2)  Tax on business of selling tangible personal property; producing. (A)  Upon every person engaging or continuing in the business of selling any tangible personal property whatsoever, there is likewise hereby levied, and shall be assessed and collected, a tax equivalent to [four]: (i) per cent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025; (ii)        per cent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026; (iii)        per cent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2027; and (iv)        per cent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2028, of the gross proceeds of sales of the business; provided that, in the case of a wholesaler, the tax shall be equal to one-half of one per cent of the gross proceeds of sales of the business; [and] provided further that insofar as the sale of tangible personal property is a wholesale sale under section 237-4(a)(8), the tax shall be one-half of one per cent of the gross proceeds.  Upon every person engaging or continuing within this State in the business of a producer, the tax shall be equal to one-half of one per cent of the gross proceeds of sales of the business, or the value of the products, for sale. (B)  Gross proceeds of sales of tangible property in interstate and foreign commerce shall constitute a part of the measure of the tax imposed on persons in the business of selling tangible personal property, to the extent, under the conditions, and in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the United States and the Acts of the Congress of the United States [which] that may be now in force or may be hereafter adopted, and whenever there occurs in the State an activity to which, under the Constitution and Acts of Congress, there may be attributed gross proceeds of sales, the gross proceeds shall be so attributed. (C)  No manufacturer or producer, engaged in [such] business in the State and selling the manufacturer's or producer's products for delivery outside of the State (for example, consigned to a mainland purchaser via common carrier f.o.b. Honolulu), shall be required to pay the tax imposed in this chapter for the privilege of so selling the products, and the value or gross proceeds of sales of the products shall be included only in determining the measure of the tax imposed upon the manufacturer or producer. (D)  A manufacturer or producer, engaged in [such] business in the State, shall pay the tax imposed in this chapter for the privilege of selling its products in the State, and the value or gross proceeds of sales of the products, thus subjected to tax, may be deducted insofar as duplicated as to the same products by the measure of the tax upon the manufacturer or producer for the privilege of manufacturing or producing in the State; provided that no producer of agricultural products who sells the products to a purchaser who will process the products outside the State shall be required to pay the tax imposed in this chapter for the privilege of producing or selling those products. (E)  A taxpayer selling to a federal cost-plus contractor may make the election provided for by paragraph (3)(C), and in that case the tax shall be computed pursuant to the election, notwithstanding this paragraph or paragraph (1) to the contrary. (F)  The department, by rule, may require that a seller take from the purchaser of tangible personal property a certificate, in a form prescribed by the department, certifying that the sale is a sale at wholesale; provided that: (i)  Any purchaser who furnishes a certificate shall be obligated to pay to the seller, upon demand, the amount of the additional tax that is imposed upon the seller whenever the sale in fact is not at wholesale; and (ii)  The absence of a certificate in itself shall give rise to the presumption that the sale is not at wholesale unless the sales of the business are exclusively at wholesale. (3)  Tax upon contractors. (A)  Upon every person engaging or continuing within the State in the business of contracting, the tax shall be equal to [four]: (i) per cent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025; (ii)        per cent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026; (iii)        per cent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2027; and (iv)        per cent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2028, of the gross income of the business. (B)  In computing the tax levied under this paragraph, there shall be deducted from the gross income of the taxpayer so much thereof as has been included in the measure of the tax levied under subparagraph (A), on another taxpayer who is a contractor, as defined in section 237-6; provided that any person claiming a deduction under this paragraph shall be required to show in the person's return the name and general excise number of the person paying the tax on the amount deducted by the person. (C)  In computing the tax levied under this paragraph against any federal cost-plus contractor, there shall be excluded from the gross income of the contractor so much thereof as fulfills the following requirements: (i)  The gross income exempted shall constitute reimbursement of costs incurred for materials, plant, or equipment purchased from a taxpayer licensed under this chapter, not exceeding the gross proceeds of sale of the taxpayer on account of the transaction; and (ii)  The taxpayer making the sale shall have certified to the department that the taxpayer is taxable with respect to the gross proceeds of the sale, and that the taxpayer elects to have the tax on gross income computed the same as upon a sale to the state government. (D)  A person who, as a business or as a part of a business in which the person is engaged, erects, constructs, or improves any building or structure, of any kind or description, or makes, constructs, or improves any road, street, sidewalk, sewer, or water system, or other improvements on land held by the person (whether held as a leasehold, fee simple, or otherwise), upon the sale or other disposition of the land or improvements, even if the work was not done pursuant to a contract, shall be liable to the same tax as if engaged in the business of contracting, unless the person shows that at the time the person was engaged in making the improvements the person intended, and for the period of at least one year after completion of the building, structure, or other improvements the person continued to intend to hold and not sell or otherwise dispose of the land or improvements.  The tax in respect of the improvements shall be measured by the amount of the proceeds of the sale or other disposition that is attributable to the erection, construction, or improvement of such building or structure, or the making, constructing, or improving of the road, street, sidewalk, sewer, or water system, or other improvements.  The measure of tax in respect of the improvements shall not exceed the amount which would have been taxable had the work been performed by another, subject as in other cases to the deductions allowed by subparagraph (B). Upon the election of the taxpayer, this paragraph may be applied notwithstanding that the improvements were not made by the taxpayer, or were not made as a business or as a part of a business, or were made with the intention of holding the same.  However, this paragraph shall not apply in respect of any proceeds that constitute or are in the nature of rent, which shall be taxable under paragraph (9); provided that insofar as the business of renting or leasing real property under a lease is taxed under section 237-16.5, the tax shall be levied by section 237-16.5.

If, under the Constitution and laws of the United States, the entire gross income as determined under this paragraph of a business selling interstate or foreign common carrier telecommunication services cannot be included in the measure of the tax, the gross income shall be apportioned as provided in section 237-21; provided that the apportionment factor and formula shall be the same for all persons providing those services in the State.

Gross income shall not include: (i)  Gross receipts from mobile telecommunications services provided to a customer with a place of primary use outside this State; (ii)  Gross receipts from mobile telecommunications services that are subject to the tax imposed by chapter 239; (iii)  Gross receipts from mobile telecommunications services taxed under section 237-13.8; and (iv)  Gross receipts of a home service provider acting as a serving carrier providing mobile telecommunications services to another home service provider's customer.

As used in this subsection "tourism related services" means catamaran cruises, canoe rides, dinner cruises, lei greetings, transportation included in a tour package, sightseeing tours not subject to chapter 239, admissions to luaus, dinner shows, extravaganzas, cultural and educational facilities, and other services rendered directly to the customer or tourist, but only if the providers of the services other than air transportation are subject to a [four per cent] tax rate of: (1) per cent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025; (2)        per cent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026; (3)        per cent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2027; and (4)        per cent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2028, under this chapter or chapter 239."

Raw Text:
HB959 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 959 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to taxation. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1. The legislature finds that tax equity is a cornerstone of economic prosperity.  According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, Hawaii places the second-highest tax burden on low-income households, with the State's lowest-income households paying approximately fifteen per cent of their income in state and local taxes.  In comparison, the State's highest earning households pay approximately nine per cent of their income in state and local taxes. The legislature further finds that the State's cost of living continues to be burdensome for residents.  According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition's "Out of Reach 2023" report, a minimum wage employee must work one hundred seven hours per week to afford a one-bedroom rental home at fair market prices.  To afford a two-bedroom residence without being cost burdened, the National Low Income Housing Coalition estimates that a person must earn $41.83 per hour. In addition to the rising cost of housing, the costs of utilities, groceries, and other everyday items have also increased significantly within the last five years.  Rising costs of these essential items can also increase the burden on lower-income families.  Eliminating the general excise tax on groceries and nonprescription drugs, for example, could ease the tax burden on residents, especially lower-income households. Further, money saved from a lower tax burden can be spent elsewhere in the local economy, creating a circular effect that will help many individuals and families statewide. The legislature additionally finds that on August 8, 2023, wildfires swept across Maui and killed at least one hundred two people, making it one of the deadliest natural disasters in United States history. The 2023 Maui wildfires destroyed over two thousand two hundred structures, including homes and businesses. Rebuilding after the devastating impacts of the wildfires on the island of Maui could cost more than $5 billion, according to a preliminary assessment prepared by the university of Hawaii pacific disaster center and local officials. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Exempt the sale of groceries and nonprescription drugs from the general excise tax; (2)  Incrementally increase the general excise tax over four years to six per cent, with the increased proceeds during certain fiscal years to be deposited into the general fund; (3)  Remove the state income tax on unemployment compensation benefits; (4)  Double the standard deduction for individuals earning less than $100,000 and joint returns earning less than $200,000; (5)  Repeal the incremental increases on standard income tax deduction amounts; (6)  Increase the minimum income threshold exemption amount for the low-income household renters' income tax credit; (7)  Remove the tax liability for the first $100,000 of individual income earned; and (8)  Establish a Maui recovery special fund for the impacts related to the 2023 Maui wildfires. PART II SECTION 2.  Chapter 237, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding two new sections to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§237-    Exemption for groceries.  There shall be exempted from, and excluded from the measure of, the taxes imposed by this chapter all of the gross proceeds or gross income received or derived from the sale of groceries. For purposes of this section, "groceries" means products eligible to be purchased with the United States Department of Agriculture's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits. §237-    Exemption for nonprescription drugs.  (a) There shall be exempted from, and excluded from the measure of, the taxes imposed by this chapter all of the gross proceeds or gross income received or derived from the sale of nonprescription drugs. (b)  For the purposes of this section: "Drug" means: (1)  Articles recognized in the official United States Pharmacopoeia, official United States Pharmacopoeia Dispensing Information, official Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States, or official National Formulary, or any supplement to any of these publications; (2)  Articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in humans or animals; (3)  Articles, other than food or clothing, intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of humans or animals; or (4)  Articles intended for use as a component of any article specified in paragraphs (1) through (3); provided that the term "drug" does not include devices or their components, parts or accessories, cosmetics, or liquor as defined in section 281-1. "Nonprescription drug" means any packaged, bottled, or nonbulk chemical, drug, or medicine that may be lawfully sold without a practitioner's order." PART III SECTION 3.  Section 237-13, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§237-13  Imposition of tax.  There is hereby levied and shall be assessed and collected annually privilege taxes against persons on account of their business and other activities in the State measured by the application of rates against values of products, gross proceeds of sales, or gross income, whichever is specified, as follows: (1)  Tax on manufacturers. (A)  Upon every person engaging or continuing within the State in the business of manufacturing, including compounding, canning, preserving, packing, printing, publishing, milling, processing, refining, or preparing for sale, profit, or commercial use, either directly or through the activity of others, in whole or in part, any article or articles, substance or substances, commodity or commodities, the amount of the tax to be equal to the value of the articles, substances, or commodities, manufactured, compounded, canned, preserved, packed, printed, milled, processed, refined, or prepared for sale, as shown by the gross proceeds derived from the sale thereof by the manufacturer or person compounding, preparing, or printing them, multiplied by one-half of one per cent. (B)  The measure of the tax on manufacturers is the value of the entire product for sale. (2)  Tax on business of selling tangible personal property; producing. (A)  Upon every person engaging or continuing in the business of selling any tangible personal property whatsoever, there is likewise hereby levied, and shall be assessed and collected, a tax equivalent to [four]: (i) per cent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025; (ii)        per cent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026; (iii)        per cent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2027; and (iv)        per cent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2028, of the gross proceeds of sales of the business; provided that, in the case of a wholesaler, the tax shall be equal to one-half of one per cent of the gross proceeds of sales of the business; [and] provided further that insofar as the sale of tangible personal property is a wholesale sale under section 237-4(a)(8), the tax shall be one-half of one per cent of the gross proceeds.  Upon every person engaging or continuing within this State in the business of a producer, the tax shall be equal to one-half of one per cent of the gross proceeds of sales of the business, or the value of the products, for sale. (B)  Gross proceeds of sales of tangible property in interstate and foreign commerce shall constitute a part of the measure of the tax imposed on persons in the business of selling tangible personal property, to the extent, under the conditions, and in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the United States and the Acts of the Congress of the United States [which] that may be now in force or may be hereafter adopted, and whenever there occurs in the State an activity to which, under the Constitution and Acts of Congress, there may be attributed gross proceeds of sales, the gross proceeds shall be so attributed. (C)  No manufacturer or producer, engaged in [such] business in the State and selling the manufacturer's or producer's products for delivery outside of the State (for example, consigned to a mainland purchaser via common carrier f.o.b. Honolulu), shall be required to pay the tax imposed in this chapter for the privilege of so selling the products, and the value or gross proceeds of sales of the products shall be included only in determining the measure of the tax imposed upon the manufacturer or producer. (D)  A manufacturer or producer, engaged in [such] business in the State, shall pay the tax imposed in this chapter for the privilege of selling its products in the State, and the value or gross proceeds of sales of the products, thus subjected to tax, may be deducted insofar as duplicated as to the same products by the measure of the tax upon the manufacturer or producer for the privilege of manufacturing or producing in the State; provided that no producer of agricultural products who sells the products to a purchaser who will process the products outside the State shall be required to pay the tax imposed in this chapter for the privilege of producing or selling those products. (E)  A taxpayer selling to a federal cost-plus contractor may make the election provided for by paragraph (3)(C), and in that case the tax shall be computed pursuant to the election, notwithstanding this paragraph or paragraph (1) to the contrary. (F)  The department, by rule, may require that a seller take from the purchaser of tangible personal property a certificate, in a form prescribed by the department, certifying that the sale is a sale at wholesale; provided that: (i)  Any purchaser who furnishes a certificate shall be obligated to pay to the seller, upon demand, the amount of the additional tax that is imposed upon the seller whenever the sale in fact is not at wholesale; and (ii)  The absence of a certificate in itself shall give rise to the presumption that the sale is not at wholesale unless the sales of the business are exclusively at wholesale. (3)  Tax upon contractors. (A)  Upon every person engaging or continuing within the State in the business of contracting, the tax shall be equal to [four]: (i) per cent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025; (ii)        per cent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026; (iii)        per cent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2027; and (iv)        per cent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2028, of the gross income of the business. (B)  In computing the tax levied under this paragraph, there shall be deducted from the gross income of the taxpayer so much thereof as has been included in the measure of the tax levied under subparagraph (A), on another taxpayer who is a contractor, as defined in section 237-6; provided that any person claiming a deduction under this paragraph shall be required to show in the person's return the name and general excise number of the person paying the tax on the amount deducted by the person. (C)  In computing the tax levied under this paragraph against any federal cost-plus contractor, there shall be excluded from the gross income of the contractor so much thereof as fulfills the following requirements: (i)  The gross income exempted shall constitute reimbursement of costs incurred for materials, plant, or equipment purchased from a taxpayer licensed under this chapter, not exceeding the gross proceeds of sale of the taxpayer on account of the transaction; and (ii)  The taxpayer making the sale shall have certified to the department that the taxpayer is taxable with respect to the gross proceeds of the sale, and that the taxpayer elects to have the tax on gross income computed the same as upon a sale to the state government.

Gross income shall not include: (i)  Gross receipts from mobile telecommunications services provided to a customer with a place of primary use outside this State; (ii)  Gross receipts from mobile telecommunications services that are subject to the tax imposed by chapter 239; (iii)  Gross receipts from mobile telecommunications services taxed under section 237-13.8; and (iv)  Gross receipts of a home service provider acting as a serving carrier providing mobile telecommunications services to another home service provider's customer.
