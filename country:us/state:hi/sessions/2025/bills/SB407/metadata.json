Extends under certain conditions the temporary disability benefit payment period and family leave period for employees who are unable to perform their employment duties due to a preterm birth of a child who is required to stay in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or birth of a child who is required to stay in a NICU for more than eight weeks.  Defines \"kangaroo care\" and \"preterm birth\".  Requires the Department of Health to amend its rules to include neonatal care as related condition where the phrase \"pregnancy, childbirth, or other related condition\" is used."
