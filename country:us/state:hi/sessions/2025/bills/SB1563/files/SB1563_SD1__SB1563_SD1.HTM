SB1563 SD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1563 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO INSURANCE. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that policyholders often lack sufficient information about how insurance rates are determined.  This lack of transparency undermines consumer confidence and fosters distrust in the insurance industry.  Drawing inspiration from states that have implemented robust insurance rate regulation and transparency measures that have successfully balanced consumer protection with market stability, the legislature finds that these measures aim to empower consumers through enhanced access to information, strengthen advocacy for fair treatment, and protect against arbitrary or unfair rate-setting practices.  By fostering a more transparent and equitable insurance market, these provisions seek to promote greater trust and accountability within the industry. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Establish rate transparency requirements for insurance companies operating in the State; and (2)  Establish an office of insurance consumer affairs within the insurance division of the department of commerce and consumer affairs to provide oversight, information, and consumer advocacy.

"Office" means the office of insurance consumer affairs established by section    -2. "Policyholder" means any individual or entity holding an active insurance policy. "Rate calculation factors" means all variables, data points, and algorithms used by an insurance company to calculate a policyholder's premium. §   -2  Office of insurance consumer affairs; established.
