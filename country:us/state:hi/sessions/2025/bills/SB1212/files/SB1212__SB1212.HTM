BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the real estate commission is responsible for, among other things, overseeing condominium projects, condominium associations, managing agents, and condominium hotel operators.  The real estate commission is also responsible for administering the condominium education trust fund for educational purposes, including education and research in the field of condominium management.  Presently, there are approximately 1,668 condominium association registrations and twenty-nine condominium hotel operator registrations in the State.  The expertise of the real estate commission is therefore critical to ensuring accountability and compliance with existing condominium law.
