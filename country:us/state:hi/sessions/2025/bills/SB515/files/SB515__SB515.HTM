Section 1:
SB515 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 515 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to THE sugar-sweetened beverages FEE PROGRAM. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables is integral to a healthy diet and central to the prevention of obesity and chronic disease.  The legislature also finds that while every community should have access to fresh and healthy dietary options, the increasing cost of fresh produce in the State has made it difficult for residents to obtain high quality fresh produce. This challenge is felt acutely by participants in the federal supplemental nutrition assistance program, which serves a low-income population that struggles to afford healthy food. Presently, the State faces an estimated $83,000,000 in annual costs related to food insecurity and hunger.  Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and rising inflation, households in the State are facing increasing food costs, and spending the highest percentage of their annual budgets on food in the nation. The legislature further finds that Hawaii could expand access to healthy foods for low-income residents who are eligible for supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits through further utilization of the national Double Up Food Bucks Program.  Currently implemented in more than twenty-five states, the Double Up Food Bucks Program provides matching federal grant funds to state programs that incentivize the use of supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits for the purchase of fresh produce.  Provided by both the United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture and the United States Department of Agriculture food insecurity nutrition incentive grants program, these federal matching funds increase access to healthy dietary options while also invigorating local economies and addressing food insecurity. Act 153, Session Laws of Hawaii 2019, created the Hawaii healthy food incentive program, now commonly known as the DA BUX double up food bucks program.  The DA BUX double up food bucks program began with a pilot program in 2012 by Kokua Kalihi Valley Comprehensive Family Services on the island of Oahu and The Kohala Center on the island of Hawaii.  The program provides a dollar-for-dollar match to supplemental nutrition assistance program beneficiaries who purchase locally grown fruits, vegetables, and proteins at participating farmers' markets, grocery stores, and community-supported agriculture projects. By the end of 2021, the pilot program was available at fifty-seven food retailers across ninety-eight market sites and pick-up locations, including grocery stores, farmers' markets, community-supported agriculture programs, and other farm direct retailers. DA BUX is referred to as a triple win for the State, as it provides support for local families, local farmers, and the local economy.  From 2020 to 2021, DA BUX supported four hundred seventy farm producers and eight distributors.  Each dollar reimbursed to participating DA BUX food retailers for their issued discounts on local produce has an economic multiplier of 2.1, meaning that each program dollar issued for local produce incentives contributes $2.10 to the State's economy.  Additional funding will allow the statewide program coordinator, led by The Food Basket on the island of Hawaii, to obtain matching federal funds for continued support of the program. For example, a $3,000,000 investment by the State in this program  would allow for a federal funding match that will contribute over $12,000,000 to the local economy annually. The legislature further finds that sugar-sweetened beverages are the largest source of excess sugar in the American diet, contributing excess calories with little or no nutritional value.  Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption is associated with negative health effects including weight gain, obesity, prediabetes, diabetes, tooth decay and heart disease, costing the State an estimated $470,000,000 in obesity-related health care costs annually. The legislature finds that establishing a fee on the distribution and sale of sugar-sweetened beverages in the State and investing the proceeds into DA BUX would be a viable means to discourage excess consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and increase access to affordable fresh produce, thereby contributing to the health of the people of Hawaii. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish a sugar-sweetened beverages fee program to be administered by the department of agriculture that: (1)  Imposes a fee on the distribution and sale of sugar-sweetened beverages in the State; (2)  Establishes the sugar-sweetened beverages fee special fund, into which all sugar-sweetened beverages fees received by the department of agriculture shall be deposited; and (3)  Requires moneys in the sugar-sweetened beverages fee special fund to be expended for the Hawaii healthy food incentive program.

SB515 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 515 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to THE sugar-sweetened beverages FEE PROGRAM.

This challenge is felt acutely by participants in the federal supplemental nutrition assistance program, which serves a low-income population that struggles to afford healthy food. Presently, the State faces an estimated $83,000,000 in annual costs related to food insecurity and hunger.  Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and rising inflation, households in the State are facing increasing food costs, and spending the highest percentage of their annual budgets on food in the nation.

Act 153, Session Laws of Hawaii 2019, created the Hawaii healthy food incentive program, now commonly known as the DA BUX double up food bucks program.  The DA BUX double up food bucks program began with a pilot program in 2012 by Kokua Kalihi Valley Comprehensive Family Services on the island of Oahu and The Kohala Center on the island of Hawaii.  The program provides a dollar-for-dollar match to supplemental nutrition assistance program beneficiaries who purchase locally grown fruits, vegetables, and proteins at participating farmers' markets, grocery stores, and community-supported agriculture projects. By the end of 2021, the pilot program was available at fifty-seven food retailers across ninety-eight market sites and pick-up locations, including grocery stores, farmers' markets, community-supported agriculture programs, and other farm direct retailers. DA BUX is referred to as a triple win for the State, as it provides support for local families, local farmers, and the local economy.  From 2020 to 2021, DA BUX supported four hundred seventy farm producers and eight distributors.  Each dollar reimbursed to participating DA BUX food retailers for their issued discounts on local produce has an economic multiplier of 2.1, meaning that each program dollar issued for local produce incentives contributes $2.10 to the State's economy.  Additional funding will allow the statewide program coordinator, led by The Food Basket on the island of Hawaii, to obtain matching federal funds for continued support of the program. For example, a $3,000,000 investment by the State in this program  would allow for a federal funding match that will contribute over $12,000,000 to the local economy annually. The legislature further finds that sugar-sweetened beverages are the largest source of excess sugar in the American diet, contributing excess calories with little or no nutritional value.  Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption is associated with negative health effects including weight gain, obesity, prediabetes, diabetes, tooth decay and heart disease, costing the State an estimated $470,000,000 in obesity-related health care costs annually.

Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish a sugar-sweetened beverages fee program to be administered by the department of agriculture that: (1)  Imposes a fee on the distribution and sale of sugar-sweetened beverages in the State; (2)  Establishes the sugar-sweetened beverages fee special fund, into which all sugar-sweetened beverages fees received by the department of agriculture shall be deposited; and (3)  Requires moneys in the sugar-sweetened beverages fee special fund to be expended for the Hawaii healthy food incentive program.
