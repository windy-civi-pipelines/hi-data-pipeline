STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS TO SENATE BILL NO. 1102
Honorable Members
Thirty-Third Legislature
State of Hawaii
Pursuant to Section 16 of Article III of the Constitution of the State of
Hawaii, I am returning herewith, without my approval. Senate Bill No. 1102, entitled "A
Bill for an Act Relating to the Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting Unit."
The purpose of this bill is to specify the appointment process and term for
the Fire Chief of the Hawaii State Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting Unit (Fire Chief) within
the Department of Transportation Airports Division.
This bill is objectionable because the appointment process proposed in
the bill is inconsistent with the selection process for other department leadership
positions. Further, the need to obtain legislative approval for the appointment of the
Fire Chief may delay the appointment of this critical leadership position and impact
airport operations, safety, and readiness.
For the foregoing reasons, I am returning Senate Bill No. 1102 without my
approval.
Respectfully,
JOSH GREEN, M.D.
Governor of Hawaii’
