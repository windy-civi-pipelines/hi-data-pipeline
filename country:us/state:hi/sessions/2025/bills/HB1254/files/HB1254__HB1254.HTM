Section 1:
HB1254 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1254 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to solicitation of funds from the public. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Act 205, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024 (Act 205), was intended to regulate charitable fundraising platforms in order to ensure proper and transparent fundraising activities in the State.  Act 205 is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2026. However, the legislature finds that Act 205, while well-intended, has the potential to create undue burdens on charitable fundraising platforms, which may hamper and inhibit the ability of charitable organizations to respond to and fundraise in times of emergency and need. The legislature further finds that it would be prudent to amend Act 205 before its effective date, while retaining public protection, donor security, and transparency, and maintaining a balance that will not burden charitable fundraising platforms, charitable organizations, and the department of the attorney general. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to amend Act 205 by: (1)  Reducing undue burdens on charitable fundraising platforms and platform charities, including requirements related to good standing, reporting complaints, waivers of certain requirements, solicitation campaign records, and contracts; and (2)  Extending its effective date to June 30, 2026.
