Section 1:
SB1233 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1233 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT Relating to Workforce Development. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "State Internship and Workforce Development Act." SECTION 2. The legislature finds that state departments and agencies face significant challenges in filling vacant positions with qualified candidates.  These staff shortages lead to inefficiencies and prevent the State from optimally fulfilling its public duties. The legislature further finds that many individuals, particularly recent graduates and those pursuing new career paths, lack opportunities to gain hands-on work experience in public service roles.  This presents an opportunity for the State to support workforce development while addressing vacancies in public service positions.  The legislature recognizes that a structured, state-funded internship program can serve as a pipeline for recruiting and retaining skilled workers in state government. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish a state-funded internship program that provides participants with practical work experience, fosters interest in public service careers, and helps address workforce shortages in state departments and agencies. SECTION 3. Chapter 78, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§78-     State internship and workforce development program.  (a)  There is established within the department of human resources development the state internship and workforce development program.  The department shall administer the program in conjunction with a designated coordinating agency.  The program shall: (1)  Provide paid internship opportunities within various state departments and agencies; (2)  Prioritize placement in departments with significant workforce shortages; (3)  Offer internships ranging in length from eighty-nine days to no longer than twelve months; and (4)  Include comprehensive training, mentorship, and evaluation components. (b) The program shall be funded through annual appropriations by the legislature; provided that state departments utilizing interns shall contribute a portion of program costs based on the number of interns placed within the department, as determined by the department of human resources development. (c) Eligibility for the program shall be open to anyone who: (1)  Is a resident of the State; (2)  Is eighteen years of age or older; and (3)  Meets specific criteria established by the department of human resources development and respective coordinating agencies.
