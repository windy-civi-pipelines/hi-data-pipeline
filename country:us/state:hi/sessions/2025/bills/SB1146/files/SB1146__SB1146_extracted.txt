Section 1:
SB1146 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1146 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to the ala wai canal. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the Ala Wai canal was built in the 1920s and is the largest artificial waterway in the State. Floating debris in the canal has been a persistent problem, which severely harms recreational users and the State's aquatic habitats in nearshore waters.  In October 2024, heavy rain in the watershed area caused serious concerns for downstream tenants, including those at the Ala Wai small boat harbor. The legislature recognizes that the division of boating and ocean recreation management has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to collect and dispose of the floating debris at the Ala Wai small boat harbor.  However, more funding and assistance is needed to better manage the floating debris in the Ala Wai canal. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds to the university of Hawaii to: (1)  Develop an action plan and pre-engineering concept to help with debris management and water quality control issues in the Ala Wai watershed; and (2)  Establish two graduate assistant positions to assist with the action plan and pre-engineering concept plan. SECTION 2. There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $125,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 for: (1)  The development of an action plan and pre-engineering concept plan to help with debris management and water quality control in the Ala Wai watershed; (2)  The university of Hawaii to establish two graduate assistant positions to assist with the action plan and pre-engineering concept plan; and (3)  Partial summer overload support for faculty mentors providing oversight of the student project teams. The sums appropriated shall be expended by the university of Hawaii for the purposes of this Act. SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2025. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: UH; Ala Wai Canal; Debris Management; Water Quality; Appropriations Description: Appropriates funds to the University of Hawaii for the development of an action plan and pre-engineering concept plan to help with debris management and water quality control in the Ala Wai watershed.
