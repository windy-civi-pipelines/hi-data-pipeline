SB353 HD2 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 353 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 2 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the emergence of COVID-l9 and its variants created a great challenge to global health, the economy, and Hawaii's way of life.  The governor and county mayors had to exercise their emergency powers under chapter 127A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to impose rules aimed to control the spread of COVID-l9.  The enforcement of those rules was critical to efforts to limit the spread of COVID-l9, protect the health and safety of the community, manage medical resources, and promote economic recovery.  The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of clear legal frameworks for state and county emergency management to ensure that the State and counties are ready for any type of emergency. The legislature further finds that chapter 127A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, should clearly specify and articulate the bases for emergency actions.  To that end, this Act amends chapter 127A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to require specificity when suspending provisions of law during an emergency; clarify when and how Hawaii's emergency management system involves coordination between state and county emergency management functions; and clarify the legal framework governing the extension and termination of states of emergency. The purpose of this Act is to clarify state and county emergency management authority, ensure effective and adaptable emergency responses, and further the goals of transparency and democratic accountability within the State's constitutional system. SECTION 2.  Chapter 127A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§127A-     Suspension of certain record requests; prohibited.  (a)  The governor or mayor shall not, through any proclamation or declaration of emergency or any rule or order adopted pursuant to this chapter, suspend access to: (1)  Records pursuant to chapter 92F; or (2)  Vital records or statistics pursuant to section 338‑18. (b)  Due to extenuating circumstances, there may be a reasonable delay in an agency's response to a request; provided that an agency shall not reject a request at any time, regardless of whether an emergency has been declared." SECTION 3.  Section 127A-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new definition to be appropriately inserted and to read as follows: ""Severe weather warning" means the issuance by the National Weather Service, Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, United States Geological Survey, or other public authority of a public notification that a dangerous condition exists that could affect the State, or any portion of it, within a specified period of time.  "Severe weather warning" includes but is not limited to warnings of coastal inundation, high surf, flash flooding, volcanic activity, tsunami, or hurricane." SECTION 4.  Section 127A-13, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§127A-13  Additional powers in an emergency period.  (a)  In the event of a state of emergency declared by the governor pursuant to section 127A-14, the governor may exercise the following additional powers pertaining to emergency management during the emergency period: (1)  Provide for and require the quarantine or segregation of persons who are affected with or believed to have been exposed to any infectious, communicable, or other disease that is, in the governor's opinion, dangerous to the public health and safety, or persons who are the source of other contamination, in any case where, in the governor's opinion, the existing laws are not adequate to assure the public health and safety; provide for the care and treatment of the persons; supplement the provisions of sections 325-32 to 325-38 concerning compulsory immunization programs; provide for the isolation or closing of property that is a source of contamination or is in a dangerous condition in any case where, in the governor's opinion, the existing laws are not adequate to assure the public health and safety, and designate as public nuisances acts, practices, conduct, or conditions that are dangerous to the public health or safety or to property; authorize that public nuisances be summarily abated and, if need be, that the property be destroyed by any police officer or authorized person, or provide for the cleansing or repair of property, and if the cleansing or repair is to be at the expense of the owner, the procedure therefor shall follow as nearly as may be the provisions of section 322-2, which shall be applicable; and further, authorize without the permission of the owners or occupants, entry on private premises for any of these purposes; (2)  Relieve hardships and inequities, or obstructions to the public health, safety, or welfare, found by the governor to exist in the laws and to result from the operation of federal programs or measures taken under this chapter, by suspending the laws, in whole or in part, or by alleviating [the provisions of laws on], subject to terms and conditions [as] that the governor may [impose,] specify, the provisions of laws, including licensing laws, quarantine laws, and laws relating to labels, grades, and standards; (3)  [Suspend] Except as provided in section 127A-  , suspend any law that impedes or tends to impede or be detrimental to the expeditious and efficient execution of, or to conflict with, emergency functions, including laws that by this chapter specifically are made applicable to emergency personnel; provided that any suspension of law shall be no broader and last no longer than the governor deems necessary for the execution of emergency management functions, and any suspension of law shall identify the section of law suspended and, for each section, shall both specify the emergency management functions facilitated and justify the suspension based on protecting the public health, safety, and welfare; provided further that any suspension of any law that requires permits, authorizations, or approvals from any state or county agency may continue beyond the emergency period to allow for the completion of any repairs, reconstruction, rebuilding, or construction of any state or county infrastructure, facilities, or properties that would otherwise be delayed by any permit, authorization, or approval; (4)  Suspend the provisions of any regulatory law prescribing the procedures for out-of-state utilities to conduct business in the State including any licensing laws applicable to out-of-state utilities or their respective employees, as well as any order[,] or rule[, or regulation] of any state agency, if strict compliance with the provisions of any law, order[,] or rule[, or regulation] would in any way prevent, hinder, or delay necessary action of a state utility in coping with the emergency or disaster with assistance that may be provided under a mutual assistance agreement; (5)  In the event of a disaster or emergency beyond local control, [or] an event that in the opinion of the governor[, renders] makes state operational control or coordination necessary, or upon request of the local entity, assume direct operational control over all or any part of the emergency management functions within the affected area; (6)  Shut off water mains, gas mains, or electric power connections, or suspend other services; (7)  Direct and control the mandatory evacuation of the civilian population; (8)  Exercise additional emergency functions to the extent necessary to prevent hoarding, waste, or destruction of materials, supplies, commodities, accommodations, facilities, and services, to effectuate equitable distribution thereof, or to establish priorities therein as the public welfare may require; to investigate; and notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, to regulate or prohibit, by means of licensing, rationing, or otherwise, the storage, transportation, use, possession, maintenance, furnishing, sale, or distribution thereof, and any business or any transaction related thereto; (9)  Suspend section 8-1, relating to state holidays, except the last paragraph relating to holidays declared by the president, which shall remain unaffected, and in the event of the suspension, the governor may establish state holidays by proclamation; (10)  Adjust the hours for voting to take into consideration the working hours of the voters during the emergency period, and suspend those provisions of section 11-131 that fix the hours for voting, and fix other hours by stating the same in the election proclamation or notice, as the case may be;
