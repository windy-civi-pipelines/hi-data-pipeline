16 beneficiary, the spouse or reciprocal beneficiary

8 cease to apply when the member or former member provides the
9 system with current information as to the member's or former
10 member's marital or reciprocal beneficiary status and the age of
11 the member or former member's spouse or reciprocal beneficiary,
12 if any, on the member's or former member’s required beginning
13 date. The information shall be provided in a form satisfactory
14 to the system. At that time, the member’s or former member’s
15 retirement allowance shall be recomputed, retroactive to the
16 member’s or former member’s required beginning date, based on
17 the updated information; provided that, except as provided in
18 subsection [ (c)-/] (d) , the member or former member shall not be
19 permitted to change the member's or former member's retirement
20 allowance option election or beneficiary; provided further that

5 retirement allowance retroactive to the member's or former
6 member's required beginning date. The amount of any
7 underpayment resulting from recomputing the benefit shall bear
8 regular interest. If recomputing the benefit results in an
9 overpayment, payments shall be adjusted so that the actuarial
10 equivalent of the benefit to which the member or former member

12 (g) If the system cannot locate the member or former
13 member, the member's or former member's benefit shall be payable
14 only until the end of the member's or former member's life
15 expectancy, as determined at the member's or former member's

3 status, it shall be presumed that the member or former
4 member is married and that the spouse of the member or
5 former member is forty years younger than the member
6 or former member.
7 [-(^] (f) The presumptions in subsection shall
8 cease to apply when the member or former member provides the
9 system with current information as to the member's or former
10 member's marital or reciprocal beneficiary status and the age of
11 the member or former member's spouse or reciprocal beneficiary,
12 if any, on the member's or former member’s required beginning
13 date. The information shall be provided in a form satisfactory
14 to the system. At that time, the member’s or former member’s
15 retirement allowance shall be recomputed, retroactive to the
16 member’s or former member’s required beginning date, based on
17 the updated information; provided that, except as provided in
18 subsection [ (c)-/] (d) , the member or former member shall not be
19 permitted to change the member's or former member's retirement
20 allowance option election or beneficiary; provided further that

5 retirement allowance retroactive to the member's or former
6 member's required beginning date. The amount of any
7 underpayment resulting from recomputing the benefit shall bear
8 regular interest. If recomputing the benefit results in an
9 overpayment, payments shall be adjusted so that the actuarial
10 equivalent of the benefit to which the member or former member
11 was correctly entitled shall be paid.
12 (g) If the system cannot locate the member or former

15 expectancy, as determined at the member's or former member's
