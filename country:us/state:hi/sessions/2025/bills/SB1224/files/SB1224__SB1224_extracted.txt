Section 1:
SB1224 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1224 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to insurance. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that since the enactment of Act 39, Session Laws in Hawaii 2022, known and cited as the Gender Affirming Treatment Act, health insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, and mutual benefit societies (collectively referred to as "insurance carriers") have been continuing to deny transgender persons' coverage for gender transition-related medical care, according to reports of patient and providers in the State. The legislature further finds that the gender transition-related medical care being denied by insurance carriers is often known to be medically necessary, classified as the standard of care according to the World Professional Association for Transgender Health ("WPATH") Standards of Care, and supported by scientific evidence.  Moreover, these denials are routinely being overturned through the external review process. The legislature also finds that since the enactment of the Gender Affirming Treatment Act, WPATH has released Version 8 of its Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People ("SOC8") and these updated guidelines have generally been adopted by insurance carriers across the continental United States.  However, insurance carriers in Hawaiʻi have taken varying approaches with adopting SOC8, with some insurance carriers having reached near full adoption and others continuing to lag.  This has resulted in transgender persons in Hawaiʻi experiencing different coverage standards for gender affirming care. The legislature additionally finds that despite the enactment of the Gender Affirming Treatment Act and its transparency requirements, insurance carriers, when denying gender affirming care on the basis of medical necessity, are not consistently providing transparent and thorough information clearly explaining the reason the requested care was deemed not medically necessary. As well, the legislature finds that the transgender community faces numerous health disparities, among which include an alarmingly increased risk for suicide and suicidal ideation. Research has found that transgender youth are about 4.6 times more likely to attempt suicide and about 13.4 times more likely to have seriously considered suicide recently than cisgender youth.  Transgender adults have been found to be about 4.4 times more likely to attempt suicide and about twelve times more likely to have seriously considered suicide recently than cisgender adults.  Denials of gender transition-related medical coverage and care contribute to the likelihood of suicide and suicidal ideations.  A 2023 federal directive from the Office of Personnel Management underscores the importance of aligning health coverage policies with updated standards of care, including WPATH's latest guidelines. The legislature therefore finds that the intent of this Act is to better implement the 2022 Gender Affirming Treatment Act.  Because this Act does not establish new health insurance requirements, it is not subject to the section 23-51, Hawaii Revised Statutes, review. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Prohibit health insurers, mutual benefit societies, and health maintenance organizations from arbitrarily denying coverage requests for gender affirming care services when the requested care is known to be considered a standard of care for which scientific evidence exists; (2)  Improve transparency of medical necessity reviews by health insurers, mutual benefit societies, and health maintenance organizations and the relevant requirements; and (3)  Codify reasonable standards, protections, and best practices to ensure that the State's transgender and gender diverse population are afforded access to the health care coverage that they need to live and thrive. SECTION 2.  Section 431:10A-118.3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§431:10A-118.3  Nondiscrimination on the basis of actual gender identity or perceived gender identity; coverage for services.  (a)  No individual or group accident and health or sickness policy, contract, plan, or agreement that provides health care coverage shall discriminate with respect to participation and coverage under the policy, contract, plan, or agreement against any person on the basis of actual gender identity or perceived gender identity.

(d)  No health care service shall be denied coverage on the basis that it is cosmetic or not medically necessary unless a health care provider or mental health professional with current experience in prescribing or delivering gender affirming care services first reviews and confirms the appropriateness of the adverse benefit determination.  In the event of a denial of coverage on the basis that a service is cosmetic or not medically necessary, unless otherwise prohibited by law, the denial shall, without requiring a separate request, include the following: (1)  The training and expertise held by the individuals who determined the service to be cosmetic or not medically necessary; and (2)  A statement, in plain language, explaining the reason the service was determined to be cosmetic or not medically necessary that is specific to the person requesting the coverage.
