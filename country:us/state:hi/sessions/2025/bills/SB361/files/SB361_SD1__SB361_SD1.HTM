SB361 SD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 361 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE COMMUNITY OUTREACH COURT. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the worsening problem of homelessness on Oahu has led to residents being cited or arrested for drinking liquor in public, being in public parks after hours, trespassing, illegal camping on sidewalks and other public areas, and other non-violent or status offenses.  Many of those cited are unable to attend court or have misplaced their paperwork due to the transient and unstable nature of homelessness.  When a person fails to appear for court and has no known address, courts are left with no option but to issue a bench warrant. Under Act 55, Session Laws of Hawaii 2017, the judiciary, the office of the public defender, and the department of the prosecuting attorney of the city and county of Honolulu established a community outreach court project.  The goal of the community outreach court is to assist non-violent offenders who are charged with offenses that disproportionately impact the homeless community by making court attendance more accessible through holding court in community locations where offenders are found, resolving any active charges, and utilizing alternative sentences such as community service work in cases where prior court judgments could not be satisfied and offenders lack the present ability to pay fines and fees.  By resolving these cases, the participants are in a better position to obtain basic necessities such as jobs, income assistance, and housing. The community outreach court social worker assesses offenders for participation in programs deemed appropriate based upon an offender's need for mental health services, substance abuse treatment, sustenance, shelter, or other appropriate available social services and assists the offenders in obtaining and voluntarily participating in these referred services. The legislature finds that the community outreach court program has been successful. Since its inception, the program has addressed over ten thousand cases, recalled over nine hundred bench warrants, lifted more than seven thousand driver license stoppers, and provided assistance to over six hundred participants at community-based sites in the judicial districts where participants may live or have access to mental health services, substance abuse treatment, sustenance, shelter, or other social services and who have completed more than seven thousand community service work hours. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to permanently establish and appropriate funds for the community outreach court as a division of the district court of the first circuit. SECTION 2. The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Chapter COMMUNITY OUTREACH COURT §   -1  Definitions.  As used in this chapter: "Community outreach court" means a division of the district court of the first circuit that shall address cases brought before it for non-violent, nonfelony offenders in which the prosecuting attorney and public defender have reached plea agreements.

"Public defender" means the public defender and any deputy public defender of the office of the public defender, including any court-appointed private attorney appearing on behalf of a defendant based on a conflict with the office of the public defender. §   -2  Community outreach court; establishment.  (a) The community outreach court shall be established as a division of the district court of the first circuit.

(b)  In any case in which it has jurisdiction, the community outreach court shall exercise general equity powers as authorized by law.  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit the jurisdiction and authority of any judge designated as a judge of the community outreach court on matters within the scope of this chapter. §   -4 Principles and components of the court.

(b)  Only cases involving nonviolent, nonfelony offenses under state law and city ordinance shall be heard and disposed of by the community outreach court. (c)  The public defender shall engage a social service or health care professional to provide outreach services to defendants charged with nonviolent, nonfelony offenses who: (1)  Are willing to participate in the court; (2)  Are willing to be represented by the public defender; and (3)  May benefit from participation in the court. After consulting with the social service or health care professional, the public defender shall develop a list of the defendants who are potential participants in the court and transmit the list to the prosecuting attorney. (d)  The prosecuting attorney shall review the list and may select from the list those defendants who the prosecuting attorney determines may be appropriate for participation in the court.  The prosecuting attorney or representative of the attorney general shall enter into plea agreement negotiations with the public defender for disposition of defendants' cases that the prosecuting attorney determines are appropriate.

(f)  At the hearing, the court may finalize the plea agreement by court order or judgment; provided that the court shall not be bound by the proposed disposition in the plea agreement." SECTION 3.
