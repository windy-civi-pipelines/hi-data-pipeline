STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO CANNABIS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 . PART I
2 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that access for
3 qualifying patients and primary caregivers to medical cannabis
4 and particularly licensed medical cannabis dispensaries remains
5 challenging due to limited access to medical providers, delays
6 in obtaining allowed access to enter and purchase medical
7 cannabis, and the availability of cannabis through a thriving
8 illicit market.
9 The legislature further finds that registration for the
10 medical cannabis program has decreased in the last few years.
11 While the number of registered medical cannabis patients reached
12 its peak in August 2021, with 35,444 card-holding patients,
13 since then, the number of patients has decreased over fifteen
14 per cent to 30,035 by November 2024. This appears to indicate
15 that residents are shifting away from licensed medical cannabis
16 dispensaries, and instead are obtaining their medical cannabis
17 from elsewhere due to administrative barriers, delays in

C.D. 1
1 registering, and the ease and lower costs in obtaining cannabis
2 elsewhere•
3 The legislature also finds that this apparent shift away
4 from licensed medical cannabis dispensaries toward the illicit
5 market undermines the purposes of the medical cannabis program
6 in ensuring patient safety, product safety, and public safety.
7 The legislature additionally finds that Act 34, Session
8 Laws of Hawaii 2021, amended existing law governing physicians
9 by eliminating the requirement for a physician-patient
10 relationship to be established by an initial in-person
11 consultation, and authorized the relationship to be established
12 via telehealth.
13 The purpose of this part is to make various amendments to
14 the medical use of cannabis and medical cannabis dispensaries
15 laws by:
16 (1) Authorizing the department of health to inspect a
17 qualifying patient's medical records that are held by
18 the physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or
19 hospice provider who issued a written certification
20 for the qualifying patient;

4 (3) Clarifying the conditions of use for the medical use
5 of cannabis;
6 (4) Authorizing the establishment of a provider-patient
7 relationship via telehealth for purposes of issuing
8 written certifications and limiting the maximum fee a
9 provider may assess for issuing a written
10 certification;
11 (5) Authorizing the sale of hemp products and accessories
12 to the medical use of cannabis at retail dispensing
13 locations, except in the waiting room; and
14 (6) Clarifying the transportation requirements for certain
15 types of dispensary-to-dispensary purchases of
16 cannabis or manufactured cannabis products.
17 SECTION 2. Chapter 329, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
18 amended by adding a new section to part IX to be appropriately
19 designated and to read as follows:
20 "§329- Qualifying patient medical records; inspection
21 and enforcement; authority. (a) The department may inspect a

5 issue a written certification for any physician, advanced
6 practice registered nurse, or hospice provider who refuses
7 inspection of a qualifying patient's medical records by the
8 department pursuant to this section.
9 (c) The department may suspend or revoke the ability to
10 issue a written certification for any physician, advanced
11 practice registered nurse, or hospice provider whose medical
12 records do not comply with the requirements of this chapter."
13 SECTION 3. Section 329-121, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
14 amended as follows:
15 1. By adding a new definition to be appropriate inserted
16 and to read:

18 an advanced practice registered nurse located in, and with an
19 active unrestricted license to practice in, the State who,
20 within the physician's or advanced practice registered nurse's

13 opinion, the qualifying patient has a [debilitating medical

15 the medical use of cannabis would likely outweigh the health
16 risks for the qualifying patient. The department of health may
17 require, through its rulemaking authority, that all written
18 certifications comply with a designated form. "Written
19 certifications" are valid for one year from the time of signing;

Aloha President Kouchi, Speaker Nakamura, and Members of the Legislature:
This is to inform you that on June 27, 2025, the following bill was signed into law:
H.B. NO. 302, H.D. 2, RELATING TO CANNABIS.
S.D. 2, C.D. 1 ACT 241

Governor, State of Hawai'i

Approved by the Governor

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO.
THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO CANNABIS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 . PART I
2 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that access for
3 qualifying patients and primary caregivers to medical cannabis
4 and particularly licensed medical cannabis dispensaries remains
5 challenging due to limited access to medical providers, delays
6 in obtaining allowed access to enter and purchase medical
7 cannabis, and the availability of cannabis through a thriving
8 illicit market.
9 The legislature further finds that registration for the
10 medical cannabis program has decreased in the last few years.
11 While the number of registered medical cannabis patients reached
12 its peak in August 2021, with 35,444 card-holding patients,
13 since then, the number of patients has decreased over fifteen
14 per cent to 30,035 by November 2024. This appears to indicate
15 that residents are shifting away from licensed medical cannabis
16 dispensaries, and instead are obtaining their medical cannabis
17 from elsewhere due to administrative barriers, delays in
2025-3334 HB302 CDl HMSO

C.D. 1
1 registering, and the ease and lower costs in obtaining cannabis
2 elsewhere•
3 The legislature also finds that this apparent shift away
4 from licensed medical cannabis dispensaries toward the illicit
5 market undermines the purposes of the medical cannabis program
6 in ensuring patient safety, product safety, and public safety.
7 The legislature additionally finds that Act 34, Session
8 Laws of Hawaii 2021, amended existing law governing physicians
9 by eliminating the requirement for a physician-patient
10 relationship to be established by an initial in-person
11 consultation, and authorized the relationship to be established
12 via telehealth.
13 The purpose of this part is to make various amendments to
14 the medical use of cannabis and medical cannabis dispensaries
15 laws by:
16 (1) Authorizing the department of health to inspect a
17 qualifying patient's medical records that are held by
18 the physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or
19 hospice provider who issued a written certification
20 for the qualifying patient;

1 (2) Amending definitions of "qualifying patient" and
2 "written certification" and adding a definition of
3 "primary treating medical provider";
4 (3) Clarifying the conditions of use for the medical use
5 of cannabis;
6 (4) Authorizing the establishment of a provider-patient
7 relationship via telehealth for purposes of issuing
8 written certifications and limiting the maximum fee a
9 provider may assess for issuing a written
10 certification;
11 (5) Authorizing the sale of hemp products and accessories
12 to the medical use of cannabis at retail dispensing
13 locations, except in the waiting room; and
14 (6) Clarifying the transportation requirements for certain
15 types of dispensary-to-dispensary purchases of
16 cannabis or manufactured cannabis products.
17 SECTION 2. Chapter 329, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
18 amended by adding a new section to part IX to be appropriately
19 designated and to read as follows:
20 "§329- Qualifying patient medical records; inspection
21 and enforcement; authority. (a) The department may inspect a

1 qualifying patient's medical records held by the physician,
2 advanced practice registered nurse, or hospice provider who
3 issued a written certification for the qualifying patient.
4 (b) The department may suspend or revoke the ability to
5 issue a written certification for any physician, advanced
6 practice registered nurse, or hospice provider who refuses
7 inspection of a qualifying patient's medical records by the
8 department pursuant to this section.
9 (c) The department may suspend or revoke the ability to
10 issue a written certification for any physician, advanced
11 practice registered nurse, or hospice provider whose medical
12 records do not comply with the requirements of this chapter."
13 SECTION 3. Section 329-121, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
14 amended as follows:
15 1. By adding a new definition to be appropriate inserted
16 and to read:
17 ""Primary treating medical provider" means a physician or
18 an advanced practice registered nurse located in, and with an
19 active unrestricted license to practice in, the State who,
20 within the physician's or advanced practice registered nurse's

1 responsible for the treatment and ongoing care of the qualifying
2 patient and has determined that the potential benefits of the
3 medical use of cannabis are likely to outweigh the associated
4 health risks for the qualifying patient."
5 2. By amending the definition of "qualifying patient" to
6 read:
7 ""Qualifying patient" means a person who [ha&]j_
8 (1) Has been diagnosed [by a phyo-i-Gian or advanced
9 prae-tice rogiatcrcd nuroo] as having a debilitating

14 of the medical use of cannabis would likely outweigh
15 the health risks for the person;
16 (2) Has been diagnosed as having a condition other than a
17 debilitating medical condition by the person's primary
18 treating medical provider who has certified in writing

2 health risks for the person; or
3 (3) Is receiving hospice care and the hospice provider
4 licensed in the State has certified in writing that
5 the person is receiving hospice care."
6 3. By amending the definition of "written certification"
7 to read:
8 ""Written certification" means the qualifying patient’s
9 medical records or a statement signed by a qualifying patient's
10 physician [©£^1^ advanced practice registered nurse, or hospice
11 provider, stating that in the physician's advanced
12 practice registered nurse's, or hospice provider's professional
13 opinion, the qualifying patient has a [debilitating medical
14 condition—and] condition for which the potential benefits of
15 the medical use of cannabis would likely outweigh the health
16 risks for the qualifying patient. The department of health may
17 require, through its rulemaking authority, that all written
18 certifications comply with a designated form. "Written
19 certifications" are valid for one year from the time of signing;
20 provided that the department of health may allow for the
21 validity of any written certification for three years if the
