HR139 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.R. NO. 139 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII HOUSE RESOLUTION urging the DEPARTMENT of education, department of health, and other relevant stakeholders to collaborate and develop a strategic plan to prepare for Hawaii's pursuit of funding for and participation in the centers for disease control and prevention's public health surveillance for estimating autism prevalence. WHEREAS, autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects brain development and unfolds across an individual's lifespan, impacting social communication, behavior, and daily functioning; and WHEREAS, autism prevalence has increased dramatically, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now estimating that one in thirty-six children in the United States is affected, up from one in one hundred forty-nine in 2000; and WHEREAS, autism is estimated to cost the United States approximately $268,000,000,000 annually, covering medical, therapeutic, and educational expenses, as well as productivity losses for caregivers, with costs projected to increase significantly in the coming years; and WHEREAS, research suggests that Asians, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders have a higher prevalence of autism, with an estimated one in thirty affected, making it crucial for Hawaii to gather accurate data to address the needs of its communities; and WHEREAS, the CDC's Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network has been the primary source of autism prevalence data in the United States, but Hawaii has never been included in this national surveillance effort; and WHEREAS, the ADDM Network currently monitors autism prevalence at sixteen sites across the continental United States and Puerto Rico, using data from health and education records of four- and eight-year-olds, yet Hawaii is not included in this essential public health initiative; and WHEREAS, ADDM data collection has provided valuable insights into autism trends, disparities in identification, and gaps in access to services, and Hawaii's participation would allow for a more precise understanding of autism prevalence and impact among the State's diverse populations; and WHEREAS, discussions with the CDC have indicated that while funding for new ADDM sites is not currently available, the CDC is open to assisting in estimating autism prevalence across Hawaii and training local teams in established public health surveillance protocols; and WHEREAS, the federal Autism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education, and Support Act of 2024 (Autism CARES Act), signed into law on December 23, 2024, provides $2,000,000,000 over five years, including $28,000,000 annually for the CDC's Developmental Disabilities Surveillance and Research Program, increasing opportunities for Hawaii to seek future funding for autism prevalence monitoring; and WHEREAS, the Autism CARES Act also includes further provisions to address disparities in autism identification and access to services, ensuring that historically underserved populations, including those in Hawaii, receive necessary support; and WHEREAS, participation in the CDC's autism prevalence estimation requires a coordinated effort among state agencies, research institutions, health care providers, and education professionals to establish surveillance infrastructure, ensure data collection and reporting capabilities, and develop long-term strategies for improving autism-related services; and WHEREAS, Hawaii's participation in systematic autism monitoring should be recognized as an opportunity to attract national attention and additional funding, ensuring that families across the State can access the early intervention, educational, medical, and vocational services needed to support the success of children with autism; and WHEREAS, Hawaii also faces critical workforce shortages in early intervention providers, special educators, pediatricians, and broader allied health professionals, including speech language pathologists and occupational therapists, particularly on neighbor islands; and WHEREAS, an investment in training, recruitment, and retention is necessary to support children with autism and their families; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, that the Department of Education, Department of Health, and other relevant stakeholders are urged to collaborate and develop a strategic plan to prepare for Hawaii's pursuit of funding for and participation in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's public health surveillance for estimating autism prevalence; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of Education, Department of Health, and other relevant stakeholders are requested to: (1)  Identify necessary resources, training, and infrastructure improvements to support comprehensive data collection and analysis for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's autism prevalence estimation; and (2)  Engage community organizations, health care providers, and researchers to enhance autism-related services and interventions based on the data collected; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of Health and Department of Education are requested to establish public health surveillance agreements and work toward executing the necessary memorandums of understanding to facilitate autism data collection; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of Education and Department of Health are requested to provide a joint report outlining the steps taken and progress made toward participation in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's autism prevalence estimation to the Legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2026; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Governor, Superintendent of Education, and Director of Health who in turn is requested to transmit copies to autism advocacy organizations within the State.
