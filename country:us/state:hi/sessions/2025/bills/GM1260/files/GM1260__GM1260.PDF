A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO HISTORIC PRESERVATION.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that it is critically
2 important to preserve Hawaii's cultural resources, including
3 historic properties and burial sites, as integral elements of
4 the State's heritage. The legislature also recognizes the
5 pressing need to expedite housing development, particularly in
6 transit-oriented development areas, to address the housing
7 shortage and create more housing opportunities in close
8 proximity to transportation.
9 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
10 (1) Further empower lead agencies, including county
11 agencies, to make determinations on the potential
12 effects of a project;
13 (2) Create a ninety-day limit, or thirty-calendar-day
14 limit if no historic properties are affected, for the
15 department of land and natural resources to concur or
16 not concur with project effect determinations;

3 significant change to the project or additional
4 historic properties, aviation artifacts, or burial
5 sites are identified within the project area; and
6 (4) Create a process for expediting the review of
7 majority-residential mixed-use transit-oriented
8 development or residential transit-oriented
9 development on certain parcels and rights-of-way
10 within county-designated transit-oriented development
11 zones that have a low risk of affecting historically
12 significant resources.
