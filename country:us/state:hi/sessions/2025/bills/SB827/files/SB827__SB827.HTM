Section 1:
SB827 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 827 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to meat processing. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that there is a need for increased meat processing capacity in the State, as smaller ranchers and hunters compete for limited capacity, resulting in the loss of potential use of wild game meat. The legislature further finds that axis deer, an invasive species that poses a continuing threat to Hawaii's environment, and other wild game could provide significant quantities of meat as a protein source and enhance the State's food security.  However, there is a gap between the hunters and these non-profit services because the meat needs to be processed prior to distribution.  Other states have developed processes for this purpose, including licensing fees and funding managed by wildlife agencies or non-profits. The purpose of this Act is to require and appropriate funds for the department of business, economic development, and tourism to develop and implement a grant program to expand the meat processing capacity in the State. SECTION 2.  (a)  The department of business, economic development, and tourism shall develop and implement a grant program to expand the meat processing capacity in the State.  The grant program may include financial assistance to establish new meat processing facilities with a donation component or expand existing facilities to include a donation component to enable hunters to donate meat from axis deer and other wild game to these facilities. (b)  The department of business, economic development, and tourism may collaborate with the department of agriculture, department of land and natural resources' division of forestry and wildlife, and department of health's food safety branch in developing the grant program. (c)  The program shall provide grants to qualified applicants with the following terms and conditions: (1)  No grants shall be given unless money has been spent by the applicant toward expanding the meat processing capacity in the State; (2)  The total amount of a grant to any one applicant shall not exceed $          ; and (3)  No grant shall be given for costs that were incurred more than five years prior to the time the application for the grant is received by the department of business, economic development, and tourism. (d)  The department of business, economic development, and tourism shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to carry out the purposes of the grant program.  The grant applications shall be reviewed and approved by an administrative staff member of the department of business, economic development, and tourism. SECTION 3.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the grant program to expand the meat processing capacity in the State pursuant to this Act. The sums appropriated shall be expended by the department of business, economic development, and tourism for the purposes of this Act. SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2025.
