<p class=RegularParagraphs><a name="_Hlk114575812">     SECTION 1.  The
legislature finds that Act 156, Session Laws of Hawaii 2016, was enacted to
monetarily compensate individuals who had been wrongfully convicted and
imprisoned in the Hawaii criminal justice system.  The Act created chapter
661B, Hawaii Revised Statutes, which is entitled &quot;Redress for Wrongful
Conviction and Imprisonment&quot;, and through which the compensation scheme
has been effect for eight years.</a></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     In enacting Act 156, the legislature found that
individuals who were wrongfully convicted and imprisoned by the State deserved
&quot;an avenue of redress over and above the existing tort remedies to seek
compensation for damages from the jurisdiction that convicted and imprisoned
them&quot;.  Pursuant to section 661B&#8209;3(b), Hawaii Revised Statutes, if a
court finds that a person has proven a claim for wrongful conviction and
imprisonment, the court is to award the person $50,000 for each year of actual
confinement, including time spent awaiting trial.  The legislature recognizes
that although the process does not explicitly require a court trial to
determine if a petitioner is entitled to compensation and the amount of
compensation, in practice, petitioners have been subjected to lengthy trials.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature also recognizes the recent
Hawai<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&#699;</span>i supreme
court decision in <i>Jardine v. Hawai</i><i><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&#699;</span>i,
155 Haw. 60 (2024)</i>.  The court considered the language of section 661B-1,
Hawaii Revised Statutes, which in part requires that a petitioner's judgment of
conviction be reversed or vacated &quot;because the petitioner was actually
innocent of the crimes for which the petitioner was convicted, and the court
decision so states&quot;.  The supreme court held that the statute does not
require the exact words &quot;actual innocence&quot; to appear in the order. 
However, the court also held that the statute &quot;does, however, require that
such an order state a finding that supports a petitioner's 'actual innocence' 
that is, the order should support the conclusion that the petitioner did not
commit the crime&quot;.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The purpose of this Act is to make improvements
to the State's wrongful imprisonment compensation law.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     SECTION 2.  Chapter 661B, Hawaii Revised
Statutes, is amended by adding four new sections to be appropriately designated
and to read as follows:</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>&quot;</b><b><u>§661B-&nbsp;&nbsp;</u></b>  <b><u>Liberal
construction.</u></b>  <u>This chapter shall be liberally construed to ensure
that those persons who were wrongfully convicted and imprisoned by the State
receive compensation.</u></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b><u>§661B-&nbsp;&nbsp;</u></b>  <b><u>Notice
of the right to petition.</u></b>  <u>The State shall provide written notice of
the ability to file a claim under this chapter</u><u> to any person:</u></p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     <u>(1)</u>  <u>Whose judgment of conviction was
reversed or vacated, and the corresponding order included a finding that
supports the conclusion that the person did not commit the crime upon which
that conviction was based; or</u></p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     <u>(2)</u>  <u>Who was pardoned and the pardon
included information that </u><u><span style='color:black'>supports the
conclusion that the person did not commit the crime for which the person was
convicted.</span></u></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b><u>§661B-&nbsp;&nbsp;</u></b>  <b><u>Presumption
of entitlement.</u></b>  <u>A petition for relief filed under this chapter for
a person:</u></p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     <u>(1)</u>  <u>Whose judgment of conviction was
reversed or vacated, and the corresponding order included a finding that
supports the conclusion that the person did not commit the crime upon which
that conviction was based; or</u></p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     <u>(2)</u>  <u>Who was pardoned and the pardon
included information that supports the conclusion that the person did not
commit the crime for which the person was convicted,</u></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><u>shall be presumptively valid.</u></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b><u>§661B-&nbsp;&nbsp;</u></b>  <b><u>Procedure
upon reversal or vacation of conviction.</u></b>  <u>Upon the reversal or
vacation of a judgment of conviction with a corresponding order that included a
finding that supports the conclusion that the person did not commit the crime
upon which that conviction was based, the court shall inquire whether the
person wishes to seek relief pursuant to chapter 661B.  If the answer is
affirmative, a petition shall be deemed to have been filed that satisfies
section 661B-2.  The court shall indicate the filing on the record and provide
notice of the deemed petition to the appropriate county prosecutor and the
attorney general.</u></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <u>The petition shall be held in abeyance for
two weeks.  If after two weeks, a county prosecutor or the attorney general has
not brought, or announced that it will bring, new charges against the
petitioner, the petition shall be deemed admitted by the attorney general and
that the petitioner is entitled compensation.  The court may appoint an
attorney for the petitioner if the court determines that the interests of
justice require one be appointed.</u></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <u>Within seven days of service of the
petition, the State shall make a payment of $5,000 to the petitioner. 
Subsequently, on the first day of every month, the State shall make a payment
of $5,000 to the petitioner until the State has paid in the aggregate an amount
equal to the payment for one year of imprisonment, as specified in section
661B-3(c).  Any advance compensation paid to the petitioner shall be deducted
from any compensation to which the petitioner is entitled under this chapter. 
If the petition is subsequently denied, the petitioner shall not need to repay
any funds disbursed.</u>&quot;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     SECTION 3.  Section 661B-2, Hawaii Revised
Statutes, is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>&quot;</b><b><span style='color:black'>[<s>[</s>]§661B-2[<s>]</s>] 
Presentation of claim.</span></b><span style='color:black'>  (a)  A petition
for relief filed pursuant to this chapter shall be filed in the circuit court
of the circuit in which the petitioner lives, or if the petitioner lives
outside the State, in the circuit court of the first circuit.  The petitioner
shall serve the petition upon the attorney general, and if the prosecuting
authority was other than the attorney general, upon the prosecuting authority. 
The petition shall set forth the facts and authority that support the petitioner's
claim.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span style='color:black'>     <u>(b)  The State
shall pay advance compensation to any petitioner who was convicted in a court
of the State and imprisoned for at least one year, and who files a petition
that supports the conclusion that the petitioner did not commit the crime for
which the person was convicted; provided that neither the State nor a county
prosecutor have filed new charges based on the same alleged act or acts for
which the petitioner was originally convicted.  Within seven days of service of
the petition, the State shall make a payment of $5,000 to the petitioner. 
Subsequently, on the first day of every month, the State shall make a payment
of $5,000 to the petitioner, until the State has paid in the aggregate an
amount equal to the payment for one year of imprisonment, as specified in
section 661B-3(c); provided the payments shall cease if the State or a county
prosecutor files new charges based on the same alleged act or acts for which
the petitioner was originally convicted.  Any advance compensation paid to the
petitioner shall be deducted from any compensation to which the petitioner is
entitled under this chapter.  If the petition is subsequently denied, the
petitioner shall not be required to repay any funds disbursed.</u></span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span style='color:black'>     [<s>(b)</s>] <u>(c)</u> 
No later than sixty days after service, the attorney general shall file with
the court an answer that shall either admit that the petitioner is entitled to
compensation or deny the petitioner's claim.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span style='color:black'>     If the attorney
general admits that the petitioner is entitled to compensation, the court shall
conduct a trial to determine the amount of compensation; provided that if the
attorney general and the petitioner agree on the amount of the compensation,
the court may issue a final judgment awarding the petitioner the amount agreed
upon or, in its discretion, conduct a trial to determine the amount to award
the petitioner.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span style='color:black'>     If the attorney
general denies that the petitioner is entitled to compensation, then the court
shall conduct a trial to determine if the petitioner is entitled to
compensation and the amount, if any.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span style='color:black'>     [<s>(c)</s>] <u>(d)</u> 
Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no person shall be
allowed to intervene in the proceeding; provided that if the attorney general
did not obtain the conviction of the petitioner, then the prevailing
prosecuting authority may state its position on the petitioner's claim in a
statement to the court.  If the attorney general did not obtain the conviction
of the petitioner, then the prevailing prosecuting authority shall provide the
attorney general with any information or assistance that the attorney general
may request.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span style='color:black'>     [<s>(d)</s>] <u>(e)</u> 
Any action against the State under this chapter shall be tried by the court
without a jury; provided that the court, with the consent of all the parties,
may order a trial with a jury whose verdict shall have the same effect as if
trial by jury had been a matter of right.</span>&quot;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     SECTION 4.  <span style='color:black'>No later
than forty days before the convening of each of the regular sessions of 2026,
2027, and 2028, the department of the attorney general shall submit to the
