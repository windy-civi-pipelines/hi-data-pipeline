BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the popularity of Hawaii-made sea salt products is on the rise.

Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to ensure the continued viability of the State's sea salt manufacturing industry by appropriating moneys to provide education and support to local businesses regarding the United States Food and Drug Administration's guidance on colored sea salt. SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $300,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 for providing education and support to local businesses regarding the United States Food and Drug Administration's guidance on colored sea salt.
