Section 1:
HB925 HD2 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 925 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE ARTS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that art feeds the human spirit and offers priceless value.  Art inspires, educates, and challenges individuals to think differently, while making the world a more beautiful and interesting place.  The legislature further finds that Hawaii was the first state in the nation to adopt a percent-for-art law through Act 298, Session Laws of Hawaii 1967 (Act 298), which designated one per cent of construction costs of new buildings for the acquisition of works of art.  The purpose of Act 298 was to beautify state buildings and increase public access to the arts. The legislature further finds that recent efforts have focused on the expansion of programs to include performing arts and other initiatives to enhance an array of arts programming across the State.  Even as programs evolve and change over the years, it is imperative that sound financial management be exercised to ensure the stability of factors that may affect the State's creditworthiness. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to expand access to vital arts and culture opportunities across the State by: (1)  Establishing a performing arts special fund to be used by the state foundation on culture and the arts for the coordination, planning, promotion, marketing, and execution of performing arts events; and (2)  Collecting revenues equal to one per cent of all ticket sales from concerts held at state venues to be transferred into the performing arts special fund. SECTION 2.  Chapter 9, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§9- Performing arts special fund. (a)  There is established in the state treasury the performing arts special fund, into which shall be deposited: (1)  All appropriations made by the legislature; (2)  Revenues charged by the foundation and surcharges, grants, gifts, donations, and contributions from private or public sources for the purposes of the special fund; (3)  All amounts to be transferred to the special fund pursuant to subsection (c); and (4)  All interest earned on moneys deposited in the special fund. (b)  Moneys in the performing arts special fund shall be expended by the foundation for the coordination, planning, promotion, marketing, and execution of performing arts events. (c)  Each state agency shall calculate an amount equal to one per cent of all ticket sales from concerts held at state venues under its ownership and management and transfer that amount into the performing arts special fund account.  The comptroller shall track amounts due from each agency as provided in this subsection. (d) For the purposes of this section: "Concert" means a live, staged musical performance, comedy act, or other specialty act or performance featuring any number of performers that occurs in front of an audience. "Performing arts" includes arts or skills that are intended to be performed for an audience, including but not limited to dance, singing, musical performances, and theater. "State venue" means a building, facility, or other improvement owned and managed by a state agency." SECTION 3.  New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 3000. Report Title: Arts; Performing Arts Special Fund; Concert Ticket Sales; State Venues Description: Establish a Performing Arts Special Fund to be used for the coordination, planning, promotion, marketing, and execution of performing arts events and to be funded by one per cent of all ticket sales from concerts held at state venues.  Effective 7/1/3000.  (HD2) The summary description of legislation appearing on this page is for informational purposes only and is not legislation or evidence of legislative intent.
