HB1410 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1410 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to housing. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the Hawaii transit-oriented development strategic plan highlights a lack of infrastructure necessary to support affordable housing and mixed-use development near transit.  Furthermore, the transit-oriented development infrastructure and finance delivery strategy (2023), developed by the office of planning and sustainable development, identifies the current fragmented infrastructure funding process as a source of inequitable outcomes.  The first recommendation of the report is to increase the conveyance tax on high-value, non-owner-occupied homes and allocate a portion of the revenue to finance infrastructure in transit-oriented development zones. The legislature further finds that there is a need to provide a dedicated funding source to support housing designed for individuals with special needs, including those with alcohol or drug addictions, individuals transitioning from incarceration, youth aging out of foster care, survivors of domestic violence, veterans, individuals with disabilities or mental illness, frail elderly, and chronically homeless individuals.  Although significant resources are allocated annually for supportive housing, reliance on legislative appropriations creates uncertainty for non-profit providers and the counties, which face significant risks in developing permanent supportive housing. The legislature also finds that the conveyance tax, a one-time tax levied at the time of property sales, is identified as an appropriate revenue source for affordable housing, infrastructure, land conservation, and homeless services.  Despite dramatic increases in housing prices over the past thirteen years, the conveyance tax rates have not been updated since Act 59, Session Laws of Hawaii 2009. In fact, Hawaii's conveyance tax remains significantly lower than comparable high-cost areas in the nation. The legislature recognizes that without reform, the current conveyance tax rate structure could disproportionately affect affordable multifamily housing, as high total property values for these complexes do not reflect the lower per-unit costs. High conveyance taxes on these properties could be passed on to renters.  Moreover, the current rate structure may create market inequities, where even small increases in property value could result in disproportionate tax burdens.  Because the conveyance tax is not tied to inflation, rising home prices will eventually push moderately priced homes into higher tax brackets, compounding the issue. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Restructure the conveyance tax to a marginal rate system, applying higher rates only to property values exceeding specified thresholds; (2)  Adjust the conveyance tax for multifamily properties to reflect value on a per-unit basis; (3)  Increase conveyance tax revenue by approximately thirty per cent, generating an estimated $35,000,000 annually, by: (A)  Raising the tax rate on non-owner-occupied homes valued at over $2,000,000; (B)  Slightly increasing the tax rate on owner-occupied homes valued at over $6,000,000; and (C)  Ensuring revenue neutrality for owner-occupied homes valued at $6,000,000 and under and non-owner-occupied homes valued at $2,000,000 and under through the adjusted marginal rate structure; (4)  Tie conveyance tax rates to a cost-of-living adjustment to maintain equity over time; and (5)  Allocate a portion of the additional revenue to permanent supportive housing and infrastructure in transit-oriented development zones. SECTION 2.  Chapter 201H, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new subpart to part III to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "   .  Supportive Housing Special Fund §201H-A  Supportive housing special fund.  (a) There is established a supportive housing special fund to be administered by the corporation for the purpose of developing, operating, and maintaining affordable, permanent housing and the provision of supportive services for individuals or families with special needs. (b) Moneys in the fund may be used to: (1)  Make loans to finance the development, pre-development, construction, acquisition, preservation, or substantial rehabilitation of supportive housing projects; (2)  Make project-based rental assistance payments; (3)  Make payments for supportive services for households residing in the supportive housing projects; and (4)  For other housing services or activities as provided in rules adopted by the corporation without regard to chapter 91. (c) The fund may include sums appropriated by the legislature, private contributions, proceeds from repayment of loans, interest, fees, other returns, and moneys from other sources. (d) An amount from the fund, to be set by the corporation and authorized by the legislature, may be used for administrative expenses incurred by the corporation in administering the fund; provided that moneys in the fund shall not be used to finance day-to-day administrative expenses of the projects allotted moneys from the fund. (e) The corporation shall consult with the counties and community-based organizations to leverage funds and obtain input on selection of projects. (f) The corporation may contract with other executive branch departments or agencies, the counties, or private or nonprofit organizations as necessary for the provision of supportive housing and services.  The corporation shall be exempt from chapter 103D in selecting a qualified private or nonprofit organization to assist with the development and maintenance of supportive housing and provision of rental assistance and supportive services.  The corporation may, without regard to chapter 91, establish rules and qualification standards for participants of the supportive housing program. (g) The corporation may establish, revise, charge, and collect a reasonable service fee, as necessary, in connection with its financing, services, and approvals under this subpart.  The fees shall be deposited into the supportive housing special fund. (h) The corporation shall submit a report to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular session describing the projects funded using moneys from the supportive housing special fund. §201H-B  Additional powers.  The powers conferred upon the corporation by this subpart shall be in addition and supplemental to the powers conferred by any other law, and nothing in this subpart shall be construed as limiting any powers, rights, privileges, or immunities conferred."
