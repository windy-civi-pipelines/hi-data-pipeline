SB302 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 302 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO FIREWORKS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the use of consumer fireworks causes fires and burn injuries, mostly to children.  Widespread use of fireworks is an ignition source for fires in Hawaii.  Fireworks produce excessive smoke that makes breathing difficult.  Noise from loud fireworks traumatizes many residents, including war veterans and pets.  With the increase in fireworks-related calls, public safety agencies are strained to maintain adequate response levels for other critical emergencies.  The legislature further finds that people in the State and its communities deserve to live in peace and security without the public safety risk and disruptive impact of consumer fireworks. The purpose of this Act is to limit the use of consumer fireworks by: (1)  Authorizing the sale and use of consumer fireworks only for cultural purposes; and (2)  Discontinuing the authorization of the use of consumer fireworks on New Year's Eve, the Fourth of July, and Chinese New Year's Day. This Act is not intended to prohibit licensed professionals' use of display fireworks, articles pyrotechnic, and aerial devices. SECTION 2.  Section 132D-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending the definitions of "consumer fireworks" and "cultural" to read as follows: ""Consumer fireworks" [means]: (1)  Means any fireworks designed primarily for retail sale to the public [during authorized dates and times,] that produces visible or audible effects by combustion, and that is designed to remain on or near the ground and, while stationary or spinning rapidly on or near the ground, emits smoke, a shower of colored sparks, whistling effects, flitter sparks, or balls of colored sparks, and includes combination items that contain one or more of these effects. "Consumer fireworks" shall comply with the construction, chemical composition, and labeling regulations of the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission as set forth in Title 16 Code of Federal Regulations and fireworks classified as UN0336 and UN0337 by the United States Department of Transportation as set forth in Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations[.  "Consumer fireworks" include]; and (2)  Include firework items commonly known as firecrackers that are single paper cylinders not exceeding one and one-half inches in length excluding the fuse and one‑quarter of an inch in diameter and contain a charge of not more than fifty milligrams of pyrotechnic composition, snakes, sparklers, fountains, and cylindrical or cone fountains that emit effects up to a height not greater than twelve feet above the ground, illuminating torches, bamboo cannons, whistles, toy smoke devices, wheels, and ground spinners that when ignited remain within a circle with a radius of twelve feet as measured from the point where the item was placed and ignited, novelty or trick items, combination items, and other fireworks of like construction that are designed to produce the same or similar effects. "Cultural" means relating to the arts, customs, traditions, mores, and history of [all of] the various ethnic groups of Hawaii."
