Section 1:
HB471 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 471 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to education. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the Republic of Korea, also known as South Korea, is a thriving democracy and one of the United State's key allies with roughly thirty seven thousand United States services members currently stationed along the Demilitarized Zone.  South Korea's economy has grown to become the eleventh largest globally and is now the seventh largest trading partner of the United States.  With a trillion‑dollar economy, South Korea has strong economic ties with Hawaii.  In 2024, Hawaii exported over $33,500,000 in goods to South Korea, making it the State's largest market.  Further, South Korean visitors contribute approximately $275,000,000 annually to Hawaii's tourism industry. The legislature recognizes the global influence of South Korean culture.  The global popularity of K-pop, K-dramas, K‑beauty and more has spurred unprecedented interest in learning the Korean language.  Nationally, approximately eight million individuals are studying Korean and university enrollment in Korean language programs across the nation has increased by nearly fourteen per cent.  Hawaii is home to the first Korean language and culture center in the United States with the Korean Language Flagship Center at the university of Hawaii at Manoa.  In addition, Kalani high school, Moanalua high school, and Salt Lake elementary have already implemented a Korean language program and has seen great success, with students requesting geographic exceptions to take these courses. The legislature further finds that proficiency in the Korean language provides tangible benefits, including enhanced career opportunities in business, tourism, and international diplomacy. Early language education also has cognitive benefits, fosters problem-solving skills, and equips students with the global perspective necessary to thrive in an international world. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Require the board of education to establish a Korean language program; and (2)  Appropriate funds for the Korean language program. SECTION 2.  The board of education shall establish a Korean language program for public schools that shall be implemented beginning with the 2026-2027 school year.  The Korean language program shall, at a minimum: (1)  Expose students to the Korean language and culture; (2)  Prepare students for future careers and economic development relating to the Korean language and culture; (3)  Develop a structured curriculum, training for teachers, and allocate resources for the Korean language program; (4)  Implement innovative and immersive techniques to teach Korean language and culture using Korean music, stories, and dance; and (5)  Research successful models from other schools to ensure effective instruction. SECTION 3.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the Korean language program. The sums appropriated shall be expended by the department of education for the purposes of this Act. SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2025.
