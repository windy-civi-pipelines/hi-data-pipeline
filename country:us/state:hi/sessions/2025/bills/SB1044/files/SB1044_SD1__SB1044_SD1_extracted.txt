Section 1:
SB1044 SD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1044 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE STABILIZATION OF PROPERTY INSURANCE. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1. The legislature finds that before the wildfire event in Lahaina, Maui, on August 8, 2023, the availability of condominium building master property insurance policy options within the condominium insurance marketplace was already shrinking.  Due in part to the shrinking condominium insurance marketplace, condominium building master insurance policies have increased exponentially, with insurers increasing deductible amounts from what used to be between $10,000 to $25,000 per unit, per occurrence, to as much as $250,000.  These increased deductibles are also due to consistent and high-cost losses. The legislature also finds that while the State has avoided a direct, major impact from a major hurricane since Hurricane Iniki devastated Kauai and damaged homes along Oahu's leeward coast more than thirty years ago, mortgage lenders continue to require Hawaii homeowners to carry hurricane insurance that can cost two to three times the annual premiums of a conventional homeowner policy. The legislature further finds that Hawaii Business Magazine recently reported that generally, a condominium building or complex carries a master hurricane policy that covers one hundred per cent of the cost to replace the property--millions of dollars in many cases.  Unfortunately, because insurance premiums for those policies have recently risen so high, the president of Insurance Associates estimates that three hundred seventy-five to three hundred ninety buildings, including new high-rise towers in Kakaako, Oahu, have opted to renew their hurricane insurance policies having less than one hundred per cent hurricane coverage.  This practice of reducing coverage is creating complications and adverse consequences for every person and entity associated with condominiums in Hawaii, from lenders and insurance agents to buyers and sellers of condominiums. Furthermore, some condominium associations for older buildings are forced to obtain property insurance through the secondary insurance market if they are dropped by the standard insurers for, among other things, having too many claims. The president of Insurance Associates reported that more than seven hundred condominium buildings on Oahu alone were built before 1990.  These secondary market insurers are not bound by the State's laws or administrative rules governing rates, so their prices may be more expensive than those of standard insurance carriers. To illustrate the difference in insurance premium costs, the president of Insurance Associates cites the example of one high-rise condominium in Waikiki in which the condominium association had been paying an annual insurance premium of $235,000 for property and hurricane insurance and had already been dropped by two of the standard insurance companies when the third company declined to renew their insurance policy.  The stated reason for the nonrenewal and rejection was that the building's aging plumbing had not been replaced.  As a result, the condominium association was forced to purchase insurance on the secondary market, which cost approximately $1,200,000. The legislature finds that the consequences of under‑insured condominium buildings, including condominium buildings that lack full hurricane coverage, also impact individual owners.  Today, there are only three insurers writing hurricane coverage for condominium buildings, one of which is only willing to underwrite $10,000,000 to $25,000,000 in hurricane coverage while underwriting all other coverage up to the building's value. If a condominium building's insurance coverage, including hurricane coverage, is below its full value, the mortgages on individual units within that building would not meet the underwriting criteria to qualify for purchase through the federal government's secondary mortgage market, meaning that these mortgages cannot be sold by financial institutions to mortgage investor entities such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Hurricane insurance coverage is available from the excess and surplus lines market, which comprises insurers who are not licensed in the State.  However, some condominium buildings are unwilling to purchase this coverage because of its high price.  The legislature understands that although this Act authorizes the Hawaii hurricane relief fund to expand coverage to condominium buildings, premium rates may be high due to the rise in the global reinsurance market for hurricane insurance caused by the frequency and severity of worldwide disasters. In addition, Hawaii Business Magazine has reported that the 2021 collapse of the Surfside condominium building in Miami is also having a ripple effect on condominium lending.  In 2023, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac made permanent the rules for condominium lending that were created in the wake of that disaster and ceased buying loans for buildings or projects that have put off major repairs--such as replacing old water pipes.  These new lending rules also prohibit the sale of a loan on a condominium building to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac if that building has unfunded repairs totaling more than $10,000 per unit. This inability to sell condominium mortgages would require financial institutions that originated mortgages to retain those mortgages, thereby lessening their overall financial capacity to originate more mortgages.  Further, the risk of loss if a hurricane occurs may impair a financial institution's financial safety and soundness, which would in turn hamper consumers' abilities to obtain financing to purchase dwellings of their own. The legislature notes that the wildfire in Lahaina, Maui, on August 8, 2023, has also impacted the way reinsurers and standard insurers view Hawaii's wildfire risk. The president of Insurance Associates estimates that while Hawaii has always been rated for hurricanes for property insurance purposes, it has never been rated for wildfires.  Now that the State has experienced wildfires, not only in Lahaina, but also in Kula, West Oahu, and Mililani, parts of all islands will be rated for wildfires.  Moreover, it is surmised that some insurers will not maintain their current policy-count in the State because of their increased costs for reinsurance, geographical concentration of risk, and inadequate rates both pre- and post‑wildfire.  Insurers have the financial responsibility to pay losses, and if reinsurance and premiums are not sufficient to cover these losses, an insurer needs to reduce their exposure by restricting new policies, reducing their policy-count, or both. The legislature recognizes that the price impact on reinsurance from recent wildfires is not fully known and price increases may continue into the foreseeable future. The legislature also understands that the market for reinsurance, the insurance that property and casualty insurance companies pay to share their risk, is global. Therefore, storms and other catastrophic losses occurring anywhere in the world may potentially impact the amounts that homeowners and condominium associations in Hawaii pay for their insurance coverage. The legislature also acknowledges that although insurance coverage, excluding hurricane coverage, for condominium buildings is available in the standard insurance market, the availability of this coverage is not guaranteed.  If this coverage became unavailable to condominium buildings, then under this Act, the Hawaii property insurance association would be authorized to provide this coverage. This Act expands the authority of these State-established insurance entities to assist in the stabilization of the property insurance market until risks can be depopulated back to the standard insurance market when market conditions improve and risks become more insurable because of building component replacement or maintenance, or mitigation equipment or protocols have been implemented for fire, wildfire, or hurricane events. The legislature also recognizes that, although there has been much focus on the instability of the condominium insurance market in Hawaii, the broader property insurance industry faces uncertainty amidst changing economic and regulatory conditions, rising costs, increased reinsurance costs, and more frequent severe weather events.  Given these precarious conditions, it is possible that a future disaster or other unforeseen circumstance could cause the availability of insurance to shrink for classes of real property other than condominiums, including single family homes and townhouses. Accordingly, this Act authorizes the Hawaii property insurance association to provide additional insurance coverage within the State for certain categories of properties if the Hawaii property insurance association and insurance commissioner determine that those categories of properties are experiencing a casualty and property insurance market failure.  This authority will provide the Hawaii property insurance association with the flexibility to quickly address potential future disruptions in the insurance market.  This flexibility is critical to ensure that Hawaii residents living in non-condominium properties such as single-family homes and townhouses are protected following unexpected disasters that could otherwise increase the cost of insurance to the point where residents cannot afford to continue living in their homes or in the State. The legislature believes that it is critical to begin the process to adequately capitalize the Hawaii property insurance association and Hawaii hurricane relief fund because insuring these risks could bring an enormous amount of risk exposure to the funds.  Therefore, funding mechanisms must be broad on an initial and ongoing basis and spread among as many parties involved in real property transactions within the State as possible to ensure that the financial impacts are apportioned as equitably as practicable, and that reserve funds are adequately capitalized if losses exceed the funds' capacities. In the past, the Hawaii hurricane relief fund was funded in part through the special mortgage recording fee, which was imposed on each mortgage recorded with the bureau of conveyances.  The legislature recognizes concerns that the special mortgage recording fee is regressive because homebuyers who need to finance more of their purchase price are assessed proportionally more than buyers who need to finance less or who can afford to complete their purchase using cash. Therefore, this Act repeals the special mortgage recording fee and instead authorizes the Hawaii hurricane relief fund board of directors to establish a temporary recording fee, which will be imposed as a flat assessment on each document that is recorded with the bureau of conveyances or filed with the assistant registrar of the land court of the State, as appropriate. This fee, if activated by the Hawaii hurricane relief fund, is intended to be a temporary funding mechanism that will spread costs out in a way that will reduce the regressive financial impact imposed on individuals and families who can only afford to purchase a residential dwelling by financing the purchase.  If the Hawaii hurricane relief fund board of directors determines that the fee revenue is no longer required, this Act allows the board to terminate collection of the fee without seeking legislative action. This Act provides additional funding mechanisms through the: (1)  Appropriation of general funds for the Hawaii property insurance association; and (2)  Option for the Hawaii hurricane relief fund to reactivate the assessment of insurers at an assessment rate determined by the Hawaii hurricane relief fund's board of directors to augment the capitalization of the Hawaii hurricane relief fund. The legislature finds that this Act is necessary to: (1)  Stabilize the property insurance market so that insurers continue to insure properties in the State; (2)  Ensure access to adequate property insurance for certain properties located within the State to allow lenders to finance mortgages that meet the requirements of the secondary mortgage market; and (3)  Serve an important public purpose. This Act is a stop-gap measure to provide insurance availability for condominium associations that are unable to purchase adequate property insurance for their respective condominium buildings that are in insurable condition. Condominium associations that apply for coverage through the Hawaii property insurance association will need to pay premiums that are sufficient to cover the condominium association's exposure to losses.  This measure is not designed to be a long‑term solution, and therefore the legislature has imposed a one-time five-year coverage period and commissioned a study to recommend long-term solutions to stabilize the property insurance market in the State.  To that end, in addition to providing for the issuance of short-term property insurance coverage, this Act also effectively requires the insurance commissioner to conduct a study to develop a long-term solution.  The legislature notes that a long-term solution may potentially include the issuance of property insurance policies for condominium buildings that are in need of repair or replacement of components. The purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Amend state laws governing the Hawaii property insurance association and the Hawaii hurricane relief fund to enable these entities to underwrite certain insurance risks in the State that no standard insurer is currently willing to underwrite; and (2)  Require the insurance commissioner to conduct a study to monitor and identify the most effective methods of stabilizing the property insurance market in the State. PART II SECTION 2.  Section 431:21-102, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding three new definitions to be appropriately inserted and to read as follows: ""Condominium" means real property that: (1)  Has a condominium association that is registered with the real estate commission in accordance with chapter 514B, part VI; (2)  Consists of units, as defined in chapter 514B; (3)  Is used for residential purposes; and (4)  Is in insurable condition as determined by the association's board of directors. "High-rise condominium" means a condominium that has four or more stories that contain units that are or can be occupied by a person. "Property insurance" means policies, riders, or endorsements of insurance that provide indemnity, in whole or in part, for the loss, destruction, or damage of property and against legal liability for the death, injury, or disability of any human being, or from damage to property.  "Property insurance" does not include any indemnity for loss, destruction, damage of property, or death, injury, or disability of any human being, or from damage to property, caused by a hurricane." SECTION 3.  Section 431:21-105, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§431:21-105  Powers and duties of the association.  (a)  In addition to any other requirements imposed by law, the association shall: (1)  Formulate and administer a plan of operation to insure persons having an insurable interest in real or tangible personal property in the area designated by the commissioner; (2)  On or before September 1, 2025, publish a notice inviting domestic insurers, as defined in section 431:3-104, to submit to the board of directors of the association current statements of qualifications and expressions of interest to serve as a servicing facility to perform the obligations of the association as described in section 431:21-106(c)(2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (9), (10), (11), and (12); provided that the request for submissions of statements of qualifications and expressions of interest shall be prepared by the commissioner; (3)  On or before October 1, 2025, award a servicing facility contract to a domestic insurer submitting a statement of qualifications and expression of interest described in paragraph (2); provided that: (A)  The processes described in paragraphs (2) and (3) and the selection of the servicing facility shall not be subject to chapter 103D; and (B)  The association, with approval of the commissioner, may award or renew a contract to a servicing facility for a term not to exceed three years; [(2)] (4)  Reimburse [each] the servicing facility for obligations of the association paid by the facility and for expenses incurred by the facility while processing applications and servicing policies on behalf of the association; and [(3)] (5)  Collect and maintain statistical information and other information required by the commissioner.

For the purposes of this subsection, "lava zones 1 and 2" means the two zones designated on the United States Geological Survey's lava flow hazard zone map that are the most hazardous and includes volcanic vents in the summits and rift zones of the two most active volcanoes within the State. (b)  A condominium association registered under chapter 514B, part VI, having an insurable interest in real or tangible property that is a condominium that is subject to this chapter, located within the State, and that meets the criteria and requirements set forth in the plan of operation, may be provided property insurance through the association. (c)  Additional insurance coverages may be provided statewide, including but not limited to single family residences, townhouses, or any other categories of property for which the insurance market is experiencing a failure of the casualty and property insurance market, as determined by the association and approved by the insurance commissioner."

(d)  The amount of and reason for any surcharge shall be separately stated on any billing sent to an insured.  The surcharge shall not be considered premiums for any other purpose, including the computation of gross premium tax or the determination of producer commissions." PART III SECTION 8.  Chapter 431P, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding two new sections to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§431P-A  Recoupment of assessments paid.  (a) Each licensed property and casualty insurer shall annually recoup assessments paid by the licensed property and casualty insurer under section 431P‑5(b)(8)(A) and (B).  The recoupment shall be recovered by means of a surcharge on premiums charged by the licensed property and casualty insurer for policies on which the assessment was made. Any excess recovery by a licensed property and casualty insurer shall be credited pro rata to that insurer's policyholder's premiums in the succeeding year unless there has been a subsequent assessment, in which case the excess shall be used to pay the amount of the subsequent assessment.  A licensed property and casualty insurer may continue to collect a surcharge on premiums until the full assessments are recouped.

SB1044 SD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1044 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE STABILIZATION OF PROPERTY INSURANCE. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1. The legislature finds that before the wildfire event in Lahaina, Maui, on August 8, 2023, the availability of condominium building master property insurance policy options within the condominium insurance marketplace was already shrinking.  Due in part to the shrinking condominium insurance marketplace, condominium building master insurance policies have increased exponentially, with insurers increasing deductible amounts from what used to be between $10,000 to $25,000 per unit, per occurrence, to as much as $250,000.  These increased deductibles are also due to consistent and high-cost losses. The legislature also finds that while the State has avoided a direct, major impact from a major hurricane since Hurricane Iniki devastated Kauai and damaged homes along Oahu's leeward coast more than thirty years ago, mortgage lenders continue to require Hawaii homeowners to carry hurricane insurance that can cost two to three times the annual premiums of a conventional homeowner policy. The legislature further finds that Hawaii Business Magazine recently reported that generally, a condominium building or complex carries a master hurricane policy that covers one hundred per cent of the cost to replace the property--millions of dollars in many cases.  Unfortunately, because insurance premiums for those policies have recently risen so high, the president of Insurance Associates estimates that three hundred seventy-five to three hundred ninety buildings, including new high-rise towers in Kakaako, Oahu, have opted to renew their hurricane insurance policies having less than one hundred per cent hurricane coverage.  This practice of reducing coverage is creating complications and adverse consequences for every person and entity associated with condominiums in Hawaii, from lenders and insurance agents to buyers and sellers of condominiums. Furthermore, some condominium associations for older buildings are forced to obtain property insurance through the secondary insurance market if they are dropped by the standard insurers for, among other things, having too many claims. The president of Insurance Associates reported that more than seven hundred condominium buildings on Oahu alone were built before 1990.  These secondary market insurers are not bound by the State's laws or administrative rules governing rates, so their prices may be more expensive than those of standard insurance carriers. To illustrate the difference in insurance premium costs, the president of Insurance Associates cites the example of one high-rise condominium in Waikiki in which the condominium association had been paying an annual insurance premium of $235,000 for property and hurricane insurance and had already been dropped by two of the standard insurance companies when the third company declined to renew their insurance policy.  The stated reason for the nonrenewal and rejection was that the building's aging plumbing had not been replaced.  As a result, the condominium association was forced to purchase insurance on the secondary market, which cost approximately $1,200,000. The legislature finds that the consequences of under‑insured condominium buildings, including condominium buildings that lack full hurricane coverage, also impact individual owners.  Today, there are only three insurers writing hurricane coverage for condominium buildings, one of which is only willing to underwrite $10,000,000 to $25,000,000 in hurricane coverage while underwriting all other coverage up to the building's value. If a condominium building's insurance coverage, including hurricane coverage, is below its full value, the mortgages on individual units within that building would not meet the underwriting criteria to qualify for purchase through the federal government's secondary mortgage market, meaning that these mortgages cannot be sold by financial institutions to mortgage investor entities such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Hurricane insurance coverage is available from the excess and surplus lines market, which comprises insurers who are not licensed in the State.  However, some condominium buildings are unwilling to purchase this coverage because of its high price.  The legislature understands that although this Act authorizes the Hawaii hurricane relief fund to expand coverage to condominium buildings, premium rates may be high due to the rise in the global reinsurance market for hurricane insurance caused by the frequency and severity of worldwide disasters. In addition, Hawaii Business Magazine has reported that the 2021 collapse of the Surfside condominium building in Miami is also having a ripple effect on condominium lending.  In 2023, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac made permanent the rules for condominium lending that were created in the wake of that disaster and ceased buying loans for buildings or projects that have put off major repairs--such as replacing old water pipes.  These new lending rules also prohibit the sale of a loan on a condominium building to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac if that building has unfunded repairs totaling more than $10,000 per unit. This inability to sell condominium mortgages would require financial institutions that originated mortgages to retain those mortgages, thereby lessening their overall financial capacity to originate more mortgages.  Further, the risk of loss if a hurricane occurs may impair a financial institution's financial safety and soundness, which would in turn hamper consumers' abilities to obtain financing to purchase dwellings of their own. The legislature notes that the wildfire in Lahaina, Maui, on August 8, 2023, has also impacted the way reinsurers and standard insurers view Hawaii's wildfire risk. The president of Insurance Associates estimates that while Hawaii has always been rated for hurricanes for property insurance purposes, it has never been rated for wildfires.  Now that the State has experienced wildfires, not only in Lahaina, but also in Kula, West Oahu, and Mililani, parts of all islands will be rated for wildfires.  Moreover, it is surmised that some insurers will not maintain their current policy-count in the State because of their increased costs for reinsurance, geographical concentration of risk, and inadequate rates both pre- and post‑wildfire.  Insurers have the financial responsibility to pay losses, and if reinsurance and premiums are not sufficient to cover these losses, an insurer needs to reduce their exposure by restricting new policies, reducing their policy-count, or both. The legislature recognizes that the price impact on reinsurance from recent wildfires is not fully known and price increases may continue into the foreseeable future. The legislature also understands that the market for reinsurance, the insurance that property and casualty insurance companies pay to share their risk, is global. Therefore, storms and other catastrophic losses occurring anywhere in the world may potentially impact the amounts that homeowners and condominium associations in Hawaii pay for their insurance coverage. The legislature also acknowledges that although insurance coverage, excluding hurricane coverage, for condominium buildings is available in the standard insurance market, the availability of this coverage is not guaranteed.  If this coverage became unavailable to condominium buildings, then under this Act, the Hawaii property insurance association would be authorized to provide this coverage. This Act expands the authority of these State-established insurance entities to assist in the stabilization of the property insurance market until risks can be depopulated back to the standard insurance market when market conditions improve and risks become more insurable because of building component replacement or maintenance, or mitigation equipment or protocols have been implemented for fire, wildfire, or hurricane events. The legislature also recognizes that, although there has been much focus on the instability of the condominium insurance market in Hawaii, the broader property insurance industry faces uncertainty amidst changing economic and regulatory conditions, rising costs, increased reinsurance costs, and more frequent severe weather events.  Given these precarious conditions, it is possible that a future disaster or other unforeseen circumstance could cause the availability of insurance to shrink for classes of real property other than condominiums, including single family homes and townhouses. Accordingly, this Act authorizes the Hawaii property insurance association to provide additional insurance coverage within the State for certain categories of properties if the Hawaii property insurance association and insurance commissioner determine that those categories of properties are experiencing a casualty and property insurance market failure.  This authority will provide the Hawaii property insurance association with the flexibility to quickly address potential future disruptions in the insurance market.  This flexibility is critical to ensure that Hawaii residents living in non-condominium properties such as single-family homes and townhouses are protected following unexpected disasters that could otherwise increase the cost of insurance to the point where residents cannot afford to continue living in their homes or in the State. The legislature believes that it is critical to begin the process to adequately capitalize the Hawaii property insurance association and Hawaii hurricane relief fund because insuring these risks could bring an enormous amount of risk exposure to the funds.  Therefore, funding mechanisms must be broad on an initial and ongoing basis and spread among as many parties involved in real property transactions within the State as possible to ensure that the financial impacts are apportioned as equitably as practicable, and that reserve funds are adequately capitalized if losses exceed the funds' capacities. In the past, the Hawaii hurricane relief fund was funded in part through the special mortgage recording fee, which was imposed on each mortgage recorded with the bureau of conveyances.  The legislature recognizes concerns that the special mortgage recording fee is regressive because homebuyers who need to finance more of their purchase price are assessed proportionally more than buyers who need to finance less or who can afford to complete their purchase using cash. Therefore, this Act repeals the special mortgage recording fee and instead authorizes the Hawaii hurricane relief fund board of directors to establish a temporary recording fee, which will be imposed as a flat assessment on each document that is recorded with the bureau of conveyances or filed with the assistant registrar of the land court of the State, as appropriate. This fee, if activated by the Hawaii hurricane relief fund, is intended to be a temporary funding mechanism that will spread costs out in a way that will reduce the regressive financial impact imposed on individuals and families who can only afford to purchase a residential dwelling by financing the purchase.  If the Hawaii hurricane relief fund board of directors determines that the fee revenue is no longer required, this Act allows the board to terminate collection of the fee without seeking legislative action. This Act provides additional funding mechanisms through the: (1)  Appropriation of general funds for the Hawaii property insurance association; and (2)  Option for the Hawaii hurricane relief fund to reactivate the assessment of insurers at an assessment rate determined by the Hawaii hurricane relief fund's board of directors to augment the capitalization of the Hawaii hurricane relief fund. The legislature finds that this Act is necessary to: (1)  Stabilize the property insurance market so that insurers continue to insure properties in the State; (2)  Ensure access to adequate property insurance for certain properties located within the State to allow lenders to finance mortgages that meet the requirements of the secondary mortgage market; and (3)  Serve an important public purpose. This Act is a stop-gap measure to provide insurance availability for condominium associations that are unable to purchase adequate property insurance for their respective condominium buildings that are in insurable condition. Condominium associations that apply for coverage through the Hawaii property insurance association will need to pay premiums that are sufficient to cover the condominium association's exposure to losses.  This measure is not designed to be a long‑term solution, and therefore the legislature has imposed a one-time five-year coverage period and commissioned a study to recommend long-term solutions to stabilize the property insurance market in the State.  To that end, in addition to providing for the issuance of short-term property insurance coverage, this Act also effectively requires the insurance commissioner to conduct a study to develop a long-term solution.  The legislature notes that a long-term solution may potentially include the issuance of property insurance policies for condominium buildings that are in need of repair or replacement of components. The purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Amend state laws governing the Hawaii property insurance association and the Hawaii hurricane relief fund to enable these entities to underwrite certain insurance risks in the State that no standard insurer is currently willing to underwrite; and (2)  Require the insurance commissioner to conduct a study to monitor and identify the most effective methods of stabilizing the property insurance market in the State. PART II SECTION 2.  Section 431:21-102, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding three new definitions to be appropriately inserted and to read as follows: ""Condominium" means real property that: (1)  Has a condominium association that is registered with the real estate commission in accordance with chapter 514B, part VI; (2)  Consists of units, as defined in chapter 514B; (3)  Is used for residential purposes; and (4)  Is in insurable condition as determined by the association's board of directors. "High-rise condominium" means a condominium that has four or more stories that contain units that are or can be occupied by a person. "Property insurance" means policies, riders, or endorsements of insurance that provide indemnity, in whole or in part, for the loss, destruction, or damage of property and against legal liability for the death, injury, or disability of any human being, or from damage to property.  "Property insurance" does not include any indemnity for loss, destruction, damage of property, or death, injury, or disability of any human being, or from damage to property, caused by a hurricane." SECTION 3.  Section 431:21-105, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§431:21-105  Powers and duties of the association.  (a)  In addition to any other requirements imposed by law, the association shall: (1)  Formulate and administer a plan of operation to insure persons having an insurable interest in real or tangible personal property in the area designated by the commissioner; (2)  On or before September 1, 2025, publish a notice inviting domestic insurers, as defined in section 431:3-104, to submit to the board of directors of the association current statements of qualifications and expressions of interest to serve as a servicing facility to perform the obligations of the association as described in section 431:21-106(c)(2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (9), (10), (11), and (12); provided that the request for submissions of statements of qualifications and expressions of interest shall be prepared by the commissioner; (3)  On or before October 1, 2025, award a servicing facility contract to a domestic insurer submitting a statement of qualifications and expression of interest described in paragraph (2); provided that: (A)  The processes described in paragraphs (2) and (3) and the selection of the servicing facility shall not be subject to chapter 103D; and (B)  The association, with approval of the commissioner, may award or renew a contract to a servicing facility for a term not to exceed three years; [(2)] (4)  Reimburse [each] the servicing facility for obligations of the association paid by the facility and for expenses incurred by the facility while processing applications and servicing policies on behalf of the association; and [(3)] (5)  Collect and maintain statistical information and other information required by the commissioner.
