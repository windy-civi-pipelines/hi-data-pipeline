<p class=RegularParagraphs>     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the
State first began regulating midwives in 1931 by establishing a registration
requirement, which subsequently progressed to certification and finally,
licensure.  However, the regulation of midwives was repealed when, in 1998,
nurse-midwives were placed under the purview of the board of nursing.  Despite
the lack of regulation, many individuals continued to practice midwifery and
many families in the community sought out midwifery services.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature also finds that, per the Hawaii
Regulatory Licensing Reform Act, the State is required to regulate professions
or vocations where the health, safety, or welfare of the consumer may be
jeopardized by the nature of the service offered by the provider.  In 1998 and
2017, the legislature requested the state auditor to conduct a sunrise analysis
to determine if regulation of midwives was warranted.  While the sunrise
analysis conducted in 1998 through 1999 and reported in Auditor's Report No.
99-14 determined that it was premature to regulate midwives at that time, that
report and the 2017 Auditor's Report No. 17-01 both determined that the nature
of the maternity and prenatal services provided by a midwife may endanger the
health and safety of women and newborns under the midwife's care and,
therefore, the profession of midwifery should be subject to regulation.  The
Auditor's Report No. 17-01 in particular recommended the legislature consider
establishing a mandatory licensing framework for all midwives.  Recognizing the
potential for harm to public health and safety posed by the unregulated
practice of midwifery, the legislature passed Act 32, Session Laws of Hawaii
2019 (Act 32), and established a regulatory framework for the practice of midwifery
that was subsequently codified at chapter 457J, Hawaii Revised Statutes
(chapter 457J).  Since the passage of Act 32, approximately forty-one
individuals have been licensed under chapter 457J.  These regulations are set
to sunset on June 30, 2025, unless the legislature takes action to continue the
regulation of midwives.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature further finds that, as part of
its sunset analysis, and reported in Auditor's Summary Report No. 25-03 (2025),
the auditor found that the practice of midwifery posed a clear and significant
potential harm to the health and safety of the public and that the State's
policies regarding the regulation of certain types of professions support the
continued regulation of the practice of midwifery in the form of full
licensure.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature affirms that the practice of
midwifery under this Act does not include Native Hawaiian traditional and
customary practices.  The legislature also affirms that practicing midwifery
according to this Act does not impede one's ability to incorporate or provide
cultural practices.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Make regulatory laws for the practice of
midwifery permanent;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Clarify the scope of practice of midwifery and
establish licensure requirements for certified midwives and certified
professional midwives, including continuing education requirements;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Grant global signature authority to midwives;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Grant prescriptive authority to certified
midwives and amend the list of approved legend drugs that may be administered
by licensed midwives;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Establish peer review and data submission
requirements for midwives;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  Affirm that the practice of midwifery does not
include Native Hawaiian traditional and customary practices;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  Clarify exemptions from licensure and grounds for
refusal to grant, renew, reinstate, or restore licenses or for revocation,
suspension, denial, or condition of a license; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (8)  Clarify medical record availability and retention
requirements for the purposes of medical torts.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     SECTION 2.  Chapter 457J, Hawaii Revised
Statutes, is amended by adding eight new sections to be appropriately
designated and to read as follows:</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>&quot;</b><b><u>§457J-A</u>  <u>Scope of
