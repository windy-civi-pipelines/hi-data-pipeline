Section 1:
HB1194 HD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1194 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO MIDWIVES. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the State first began regulating midwives in 1931 by establishing a registration requirement, which subsequently progressed to certification and finally, licensure.  However, the regulation of midwives was repealed when, in 1998, nurse-midwives were placed under the purview of the board of nursing.  Despite the lack of regulation, many individuals continued to practice midwifery and many families in the community sought out midwife services. The legislature also finds that, per the Hawaii Regulatory Licensing Reform Act, the State is required to regulate professions or vocations where the health, safety, or welfare of the consumer may be jeopardized by the nature of the service offered by the provider.  In 1999 and 2017, the legislature requested the state auditor to conduct a sunrise analysis to determine if regulation of midwives was warranted.  While the sunrise analysis conducted in 1999 and reported in Auditor's Report No. 99-14 determined that it was premature to regulate midwives at that time, that report and the 2017 Auditor's Report No. 17-01 both determined that the nature of the maternity and prenatal services provided by a midwife may endanger the health and safety of women and newborns under the midwife's care and, therefore, the profession of midwifery should be subject to regulation.  The Auditor's Report No. 17-01 in particular recommended the legislature consider establishing a mandatory licensing framework for all midwives.  Recognizing the potential for harm to public health and safety posed by the unregulated practice of midwifery, the legislature passed Act 32, Session Laws of Hawaii 2019 (Act 32), and established a regulatory framework for the practice of midwifery that was subsequently codified as chapter 457J, Hawaii Revised Statutes (chapter 457J).  Since the passage of Act 32, approximately forty-one individuals have been licensed under chapter 457J.  These regulations are set to sunset on June 30, 2025, unless the legislature takes action to continue the regulation of midwives. The legislature further finds that, as part of its sunset analysis, and reported in Auditor's Summary Report No. 25-03 (2025), the auditor found that the practice of midwifery posed a clear and significant potential harm to the health and safety of the public and that the State's policies regarding the regulation of certain types of professions support the continued regulation of the practice of midwifery in the form of full licensure. The legislature affirms that the practice of midwifery under this Act does not include Native Hawaiian traditional practices performed by traditional Hawaiian healers.  The legislature also affirms that practicing midwifery according to this Act does not impede one's ability to incorporate or provide cultural practices. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Make regulatory laws for the practice of midwifery permanent; (2)  Clarify the scope of practice of midwifery and establish licensure requirements for certified midwives and certified professional midwives, including continuing education requirements; (3)  Grants global signature authority to midwives; (4)  Grant prescriptive authority to certified midwives and amend the list of approved legend drugs that may be administered; (5)  Establish peer review and data submission requirements for midwives; (6)  Affirm that the practice of midwifery does not include traditional native Hawaiian healing practices performed by traditional Hawaiian healers; (7)  Clarify exemptions from licensure and grounds for refusal to renew, reinstate, or restore licenses; and (8)  Clarify medical record availability and retention requirements for the purposes of medical torts.

HB1194 HD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1194 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO MIDWIVES. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the State first began regulating midwives in 1931 by establishing a registration requirement, which subsequently progressed to certification and finally, licensure.  However, the regulation of midwives was repealed when, in 1998, nurse-midwives were placed under the purview of the board of nursing.  Despite the lack of regulation, many individuals continued to practice midwifery and many families in the community sought out midwife services. The legislature also finds that, per the Hawaii Regulatory Licensing Reform Act, the State is required to regulate professions or vocations where the health, safety, or welfare of the consumer may be jeopardized by the nature of the service offered by the provider.  In 1999 and 2017, the legislature requested the state auditor to conduct a sunrise analysis to determine if regulation of midwives was warranted.  While the sunrise analysis conducted in 1999 and reported in Auditor's Report No. 99-14 determined that it was premature to regulate midwives at that time, that report and the 2017 Auditor's Report No. 17-01 both determined that the nature of the maternity and prenatal services provided by a midwife may endanger the health and safety of women and newborns under the midwife's care and, therefore, the profession of midwifery should be subject to regulation.  The Auditor's Report No. 17-01 in particular recommended the legislature consider establishing a mandatory licensing framework for all midwives.  Recognizing the potential for harm to public health and safety posed by the unregulated practice of midwifery, the legislature passed Act 32, Session Laws of Hawaii 2019 (Act 32), and established a regulatory framework for the practice of midwifery that was subsequently codified as chapter 457J, Hawaii Revised Statutes (chapter 457J).  Since the passage of Act 32, approximately forty-one individuals have been licensed under chapter 457J.  These regulations are set to sunset on June 30, 2025, unless the legislature takes action to continue the regulation of midwives. The legislature further finds that, as part of its sunset analysis, and reported in Auditor's Summary Report No. 25-03 (2025), the auditor found that the practice of midwifery posed a clear and significant potential harm to the health and safety of the public and that the State's policies regarding the regulation of certain types of professions support the continued regulation of the practice of midwifery in the form of full licensure. The legislature affirms that the practice of midwifery under this Act does not include Native Hawaiian traditional practices performed by traditional Hawaiian healers.  The legislature also affirms that practicing midwifery according to this Act does not impede one's ability to incorporate or provide cultural practices. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Make regulatory laws for the practice of midwifery permanent; (2)  Clarify the scope of practice of midwifery and establish licensure requirements for certified midwives and certified professional midwives, including continuing education requirements; (3)  Grants global signature authority to midwives; (4)  Grant prescriptive authority to certified midwives and amend the list of approved legend drugs that may be administered; (5)  Establish peer review and data submission requirements for midwives; (6)  Affirm that the practice of midwifery does not include traditional native Hawaiian healing practices performed by traditional Hawaiian healers; (7)  Clarify exemptions from licensure and grounds for refusal to renew, reinstate, or restore licenses; and (8)  Clarify medical record availability and retention requirements for the purposes of medical torts.
