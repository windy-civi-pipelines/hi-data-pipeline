STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FORAN ACT
RELATING TO THE WOMEN'S COURT.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 PART I
2 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that there has been a
3 significant increase in the number of women in Hawai'i jails and
4 prisons over the past forty years, resulting in a higher
5 proportion of women who are incarcerated. Research reflects
6 that for women, histories of abuse, trauma, poverty, mental
7 illness, substance use disorders, and unhealthy relationships
8 intersect with their entry into criminal behavior. Women
9 offenders also face unique barriers to success after
10 incarceration. They are more likely to be primary caregivers
11 for young children, have lower educational attainment, lack
12 stable work history, and experience economic or social
13 marginalization, which prevents them from having more positive
14 outcomes.
15 The legislature further finds that Act 243, Session Laws of
16 Hawaii 2022, established a three-year women's court pilot
17 program in the circuit court of the first circuit. This
2025-3431 HB727 GDI HMSO

C.D. 1
1 program, known as Mohala Wahine, focuses on non-violent women
2 who are at high risk of recidivism and in need of multiple
3 services such as substance abuse treatment, therapy, or housing.
4 The program began accepting participants in January 2023, with a
5 goal of admitting twenty women each year. As of August 2024,
6 twenty-three women are currently participating in the program,
7 with eleven participants in phase one of treatment and twelve
8 participants in phase two of treatment.
9 The purpose of this Act is to:
10 (1) Permanently establish the women's court program in the
11 first circuit;
12 (2) Establish a two-year women's court pilot program in
13 the circuit court of the Kona division of the third
14 circuit, which is intended to acknowledge the distinct
15 pathways that lead women into the criminal justice
16 system and address their individualized needs; and
17 (3) Require the judiciary to submit reports to the
18 legislature regarding the pilot program for women's
19 court.
