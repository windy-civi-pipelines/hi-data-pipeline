SCR149 THE SENATE S.C.R. NO. 149 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION requesting the office of the state fire marshal to convene a vegetation management working group to study, evaluate, and make recommendations for REGULATIONS that define property owner obligations for vegetation management on public and private property TO MITIGATE wildfire RISK. WHEREAS, on August 8, 2023, catastrophic wildfires swept through various communities on the island of Maui; and WHEREAS, the wildfires significantly impacted human life and the health, community housing, education, economy, and environment of Maui residents; and WHEREAS, the presence of grass, trees, and other vegetation adjacent to or under electric utility lines is a significant fire risk; and WHEREAS, in response to the wildfires, in 2023 the House of Representatives established six interim working groups, including the Wildfire Prevention Working Group, which were charged with evaluating specific topics related to the Lahaina wildfire and making recommendations for specific legislative action; and WHEREAS, the Wildfire Prevention Working Group found that people are the primary drivers of wildfires in Hawaii, as ninety-nine percent of wildfires are caused by human ignitions; and WHEREAS, the Wildfire Prevention Working Group also found that guinea grass, fountain grass, molasses grass, and buffelgrass can form continuous fuel beds, ignite easily, attain extremely high fine fuel loads, and grow back more vigorously in the post-fire environment than the majority of native vegetation; and WHEREAS, utility companies have miles of utility lines installed throughout the State on public and private lands, including within the public rights of way and mountainous areas of the State; and WHEREAS, a significant portion of these public lands is covered with unmanaged grasses, trees, and other vegetation that may pose a significant wildfire risk;
