Section 1:
HB322 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 322 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO VOTER REGISTRATION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that every eligible person should be able to register to vote in a convenient and secure way that is beneficial to new voters and administrators alike.  Key voter registration improvements can ensure state election systems are secure and efficient, safeguard votes, and save money. The legislature further finds that in 2021, Hawaii established automatic voter registration to increase the State's historically low voter participation rates.  Yet, the automatic voter registration system established by the legislature was an opt-in system that places the responsibility for registration on the part of individual voters, which fails to fully include the total potential population of new voters. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to improve Hawaii's voter participation rate by strengthening the State's automatic voter registration program. SECTION 2.  Section 11-15.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "[[]§11-15.5[]] Duties of all state agencies; voter registration.  (a) Each state agency that deals with the public shall make available to each member of the public eighteen years of age or older an application in the form of an affidavit for voter registration pursuant to section 11-15.  The application shall be available by mail, online, or in person depending on the manner in which the agency's services are requested by the person.  The form of the application may be identical to that described and found in public telephone directories. (b)  Subject to compliance with applicable federal laws and regulations, the department of human services shall automatically transmit voter registration information for any Med-QUEST applicant who is of sufficient age to register to vote, has provided a Hawaii residence address, and has been verified as a United States citizen as part of an application to the Med-QUEST division.  For each eligible Med-QUEST applicant, the department of human services shall electronically transmit the information set forth in section 11-15.7(b) to the clerk of the county in which the applicant resides.  The office of elections and clerks shall process the information according to the requirements established in section 11-15.7, to the extent applicable as determined by the office of elections. (c)  Any state agency may be designated by the office of elections to implement automatic voter registration if the agency collects, processes, or stores the following information as part of providing assistance or services:  name, residential address, date of birth, and proof of United States citizenship or external verification of United States citizenship.  An eligible agency may establish and implement, upon approval from the office of elections, a procedure to automatically and electronically transmit a person's voter registration information to the clerk of the county in which the person resides.  Every eligible agency shall comply with the requirements in section 11-15.7, to the extent applicable as determined by the office of elections." SECTION 3.  Section 11-15.7, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "[[]§11-15.7[]]  Automatic registration[.] and preregistration.  (a)  [An application for voter registration shall be a part of the application for issuance of an identification card under section 286-303 and the application for issuance of a driver's license under section 286-111.  Applications for an identification card or driver's license shall not be processed until the applicant completes the portion of the application related to voter registration and indicates the applicant's choice of whether to register to vote.  If already registered to vote, the applicant shall be offered the opportunity to decline any changes being made to their name and address for voter registration purposes.] The submission of the application for the issuance of [an identification] a new, renewed, or duplicate: (1)  Instruction permit under section 286-110, 286-111, or 286-117; (2)  Provisional license under section 286-111 or 286-117; (3)  Driver's license under section 286-107, 286-111, or 286-117; or (4)  Identification card under section 286-303 [or the application for a driver's license under section 286-111], shall be deemed to authorize the examiner of drivers to collect and transmit the information necessary to register or preregister, pursuant to section 11-12(b), the applicant as a voter if the applicant [made such a choice or to make changes to the applicant's voter registration information unless the applicant declined such changes.] is of sufficient age to register or preregister to vote, has provided a Hawaii residence address, and has presented documentation demonstrating United States citizenship.

(f)  If an applicant returns the form declining to be registered or preregistered to vote, the applicant's voter registration or preregistration shall be canceled, and the applicant shall be deemed to have never registered or preregistered to vote; provided that if the applicant votes in an election after the transfer of the applicant's voter registration information but before the form declining to be registered to vote is returned, the returned form shall be of no force and effect and the applicant shall be deemed registered to vote as of the date of the applicant's qualifying transaction with the examiner of drivers. If an applicant returns the form declining to have the applicant's voter registration or preregistration information updated, the applicant's voter registration or preregistration information shall not be updated. If the applicant does not decline voter registration or preregistration or to have the applicant's voter registration or preregistration information updated within the period prescribed by the office of elections, the clerk shall proceed to number the application and register the name of the [voter] applicant in the general county register as provided in section 11‑14, preregister the applicant as provided in section 11-12, or [make approved changes to] update the [voter's] applicant's existing voter registration or preregistration information as applicable.  The date of registration or preregistration shall be the date of the applicant's qualifying transaction with the examiner of drivers.

The legislature further finds that in 2021, Hawaii established automatic voter registration to increase the State's historically low voter participation rates.  Yet, the automatic voter registration system established by the legislature was an opt-in system that places the responsibility for registration on the part of individual voters, which fails to fully include the total potential population of new voters. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to improve Hawaii's voter participation rate by strengthening the State's automatic voter registration program. SECTION 2.  Section 11-15.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "[[]§11-15.5[]] Duties of all state agencies; voter registration.  (a) Each state agency that deals with the public shall make available to each member of the public eighteen years of age or older an application in the form of an affidavit for voter registration pursuant to section 11-15.  The application shall be available by mail, online, or in person depending on the manner in which the agency's services are requested by the person.  The form of the application may be identical to that described and found in public telephone directories. (b)  Subject to compliance with applicable federal laws and regulations, the department of human services shall automatically transmit voter registration information for any Med-QUEST applicant who is of sufficient age to register to vote, has provided a Hawaii residence address, and has been verified as a United States citizen as part of an application to the Med-QUEST division.  For each eligible Med-QUEST applicant, the department of human services shall electronically transmit the information set forth in section 11-15.7(b) to the clerk of the county in which the applicant resides.  The office of elections and clerks shall process the information according to the requirements established in section 11-15.7, to the extent applicable as determined by the office of elections. (c)  Any state agency may be designated by the office of elections to implement automatic voter registration if the agency collects, processes, or stores the following information as part of providing assistance or services:  name, residential address, date of birth, and proof of United States citizenship or external verification of United States citizenship.  An eligible agency may establish and implement, upon approval from the office of elections, a procedure to automatically and electronically transmit a person's voter registration information to the clerk of the county in which the person resides.  Every eligible agency shall comply with the requirements in section 11-15.7, to the extent applicable as determined by the office of elections." SECTION 3.  Section 11-15.7, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "[[]§11-15.7[]]  Automatic registration[.] and preregistration.  (a)  [An application for voter registration shall be a part of the application for issuance of an identification card under section 286-303 and the application for issuance of a driver's license under section 286-111.  Applications for an identification card or driver's license shall not be processed until the applicant completes the portion of the application related to voter registration and indicates the applicant's choice of whether to register to vote.  If already registered to vote, the applicant shall be offered the opportunity to decline any changes being made to their name and address for voter registration purposes.] The submission of the application for the issuance of [an identification] a new, renewed, or duplicate: (1)  Instruction permit under section 286-110, 286-111, or 286-117; (2)  Provisional license under section 286-111 or 286-117; (3)  Driver's license under section 286-107, 286-111, or 286-117; or (4)  Identification card under section 286-303 [or the application for a driver's license under section 286-111], shall be deemed to authorize the examiner of drivers to collect and transmit the information necessary to register or preregister, pursuant to section 11-12(b), the applicant as a voter if the applicant [made such a choice or to make changes to the applicant's voter registration information unless the applicant declined such changes.] is of sufficient age to register or preregister to vote, has provided a Hawaii residence address, and has presented documentation demonstrating United States citizenship.

If an applicant returns the form declining to have the applicant's voter registration or preregistration information updated, the applicant's voter registration or preregistration information shall not be updated. If the applicant does not decline voter registration or preregistration or to have the applicant's voter registration or preregistration information updated within the period prescribed by the office of elections, the clerk shall proceed to number the application and register the name of the [voter] applicant in the general county register as provided in section 11‑14, preregister the applicant as provided in section 11-12, or [make approved changes to] update the [voter's] applicant's existing voter registration or preregistration information as applicable.  The date of registration or preregistration shall be the date of the applicant's qualifying transaction with the examiner of drivers.
