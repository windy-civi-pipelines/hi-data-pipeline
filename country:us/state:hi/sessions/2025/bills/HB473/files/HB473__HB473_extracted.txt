Section 1:
HB473 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 473 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to voter registration. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that voter turnout in the State remains low and continues to decline. Additionally, the State has a historically low rate of registered voters. The legislature further finds that voting at a young age creates and empowers life-long voters.  Data shows that after an individual votes once, the individual often becomes a habitual voter.  Therefore, by facilitating the ability of those sixteen years of age and older to preregister or register to vote, the State will be empowering a new generation of lifelong voters. The purpose of this Act is to increase voter participation and encourage civic engagement in Hawaii's schools by establishing a process for the automatic preregistration and registration of public, charter, and private school-enrolled students who are at least sixteen years of age. SECTION 2.  Chapter 11, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part II to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§11-     Automatic voter preregistration and registration.  (a)  Beginning January 1, 2026, any person who: (1)  Is enrolled in a public high school, public charter school, or private school; (2)  Is at least sixteen years of age; (3)  Is otherwise qualified to preregister or register to vote under this part; and (4)  Properly completes and submits a voter registration affidavit, shall be automatically preregistered or registered to vote as provided in this section. (b)  Between January 1 and January 31 of each year, the superintendent of education, in collaboration with the office of elections, shall provide and may collect from each public school student who is at least sixteen years of age a voter affidavit containing the information required by section 11-15 to allow the student to preregister or register to vote or to opt out of preregistering or registering to vote. The superintendent of education may transmit the voter registration affidavit to the clerk of the county in which the applicant resides; provided that the superintendent of education shall not maintain, scan, review, or copy any voter affidavit nor transmit any information maintained by the department of education.

(e)  The clerk shall determine whether the applicant is currently preregistered or registered in the general county register."
