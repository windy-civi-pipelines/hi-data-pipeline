HCR130 HD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.C.R. NO. 130 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION URGING THE STATE, COUNTIES, AND OTHER RELEVANT AGENCIES TO PROVIDE INCREASED AND SUSTAINED FUNDING TO THE INVASIVE SPECIES COMMITTEES AND HAWAIʻI ANT LAB WITHIN THE PACIFIC COOPERATIVE STUDIES UNIT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MĀNOA. WHEREAS, the State of Hawaii is home to unique and fragile ecosystems, many of which are found nowhere else in the world, and protecting these ecosystems is crucial to preserving Hawaii's natural heritage, biodiversity, and the overall health of the environment; and WHEREAS, invasive species, both plant and animal, pose one of the greatest threats to Hawaii's native flora and fauna, disrupting natural processes, outcompeting native species, introducing diseases, and altering habitats, often with irreversible consequences; and WHEREAS, the impact of invasive species extends beyond environmental damage, severely affecting Hawaii's agricultural sector, a key pillar of the State's economy, by damaging crops, reducing yields, and increasing production costs; and WHEREAS, invasive species also threaten Hawaii's tourism industry by compromising the beauty and biodiversity of natural landscapes, which are a significant draw for visitors, and by degrading the quality of outdoor recreational activities such as hiking and fishing; and WHEREAS, the economic consequences of invasive species are wide-ranging, resulting in millions of dollars in lost revenue from agriculture and tourism, as well as increased costs for property owners, businesses, and agencies tasked with managing and mitigating these threats; and WHEREAS, the Invasive Species Committees (ISCs), including the Big Island Invasive Species Committee, Maui Invasive Species Committee, Molokai Maui Invasive Species Committee, Oahu Invasive Species Committee, Kauai Invasive Species Committee, and Hawaiʻi Ant Lab, have played a critical role in managing and preventing the spread of invasive species throughout the State, focusing on early detection, rapid response, control, and eradication of harmful species that threaten Hawaii's natural ecosystems, economy, and communities; and WHEREAS, the ISCs serve as an important gap filler by tailoring their target pest lists to be area-specific, addressing localized invasive species threats, and ensuring that control efforts are aligned with the unique needs of each region, thereby maximizing the effectiveness of limited resources; and WHEREAS, the ISCs rely on limited funding to implement targeted control programs, provide education and outreach to the public, and conduct on-the-ground management actions to prevent the establishment and spread of invasive species, which, if left unchecked, could cost the State and residents millions of dollars in damages and lost revenue; and WHEREAS, investing in invasive species management will protect Hawaii's environment and economy by safeguarding agriculture, tourism, and local industries, while also enhancing the State's resilience to climate change by maintaining healthy ecosystems that support essential services such as water quality, soil stability, and biodiversity; and WHEREAS, failure to address invasive species in a timely and effective manner will result in long-term ecological and economic damage, costing millions of dollars annually in treatment and mitigation efforts; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, the Senate concurring, that the counties, State, and other relevant agencies are urged to provide increased and sustained funding to the Invasive Species Committees within the Pacific Cooperative Studies Unit of the University of Hawaii at Mānoa; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that this body urges the counties, State, and other relevant agencies, including the Department of Agriculture and Department of Land and Natural Resources, to provide sustained funding to the ISCs to strengthen their ability to combat the growing threat of invasive species and protect Hawaii's ecosystems and economy; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that funding be directed toward expanding invasive species control programs to target priority species, increasing research and monitoring efforts to detect new invasions early, enhancing public outreach and education to raise awareness about preventing the spread of invasive species, supporting interagency and community collaboration to improve response coordination and resource-sharing, and providing treatment options for residents and farmers impacted by these species, including grants for control efforts and the purchase of treatment supplies; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Governor; Chairperson of the Board of Agriculture; Chairperson of the Board of Land and Natural Resources; Director of the Pacific Cooperative Studies Unit of the University of Hawaii at Mānoa; and Mayors of the Counties of Maui, Kauai, and Hawaii and Mayor of the City and County of Honolulu.
