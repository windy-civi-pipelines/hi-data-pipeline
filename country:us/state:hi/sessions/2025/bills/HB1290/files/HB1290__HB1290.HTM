HB1290 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1290 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to labor. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that gig workers are independent contractors or freelancers who typically do short-term work for multiple clients.  The gig work may be project-based, hourly or part-time, and can either be an ongoing contract or a temporary position. Due to new labor market dynamics and technological innovations, the enlistment of gig workers is increasingly more popular.  By some estimates, over one-third of United States workers now participate in the gig economy.  In Hawaii, reports have estimated that there are more than one hundred ten thousand gig workers in the State.  Of these gig workers, the highest proportion are between the ages of eighteen and twenty-nine. The legislature further finds that due to their classification as independent contractors, gig workers are generally excluded from a litany of employee benefits and protections, ranging from paid leave and retirement plans to workers' compensation and health insurance.  These benefits are critical to individual and household financial security and, in their absence, workers and their families are at greater risk of income and expense volatility. The legislature finds that it is in the best interests of the people of the State to ensure that these benefits are extended to gig workers to ensure economic stability.  In devising the new provision of benefits, the benefits should be independent of the employers and connected to the individual worker.  Furthermore, the benefits would be portable, taken from job to job without interruption in coverage or loss of funding. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish a program of portable benefits for gig workers. SECTION 2.  The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Chapter portable benefits program §   -1  Definitions.  As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires: "Board" means the board of trustees of the portable benefits program established under section -2. "Contracting agent" means a business, organization, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, sole proprietor, or any other entity that facilitates the provision of services by workers to consumers seeking the services and makes payments to workers, where the provision of services is taxed as an independent contractor, using federal Internal Revenue Service form 1099.
