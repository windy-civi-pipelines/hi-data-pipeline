A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO THE HAWAII COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that Act 184, Session
2 Laws of Hawaii 2022 (Act 184), which established
3 transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement
4 districts, could be more efficient and effective. The
5 transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement
6 districts comprised the land within county-designated
7 transit-oriented development zones or within a one-half mile
8 radius of a proposed or existing transit station if the county
9 has not designated transit-oriented development zones, as
10 designated by the board. Act 184 also established the
11 transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement district
12 boards for each county, under the Hawaii community development
13 authority for administrative purposes. To date, these boards
14 have not been constituted, due in part to a lack of community
15 volunteers willing to serve.
16 The legislature further finds that the best-proven models
17 of successful, affordable, healthy, and vibrant communities in

1 transit-oriented development areas require sufficient water,
2 sewer, and power infrastructure; affordable housing; safe,
3 comfortable, and convenient pedestrian and multi-modal transit
4 connectivity; meaningful community amenities such as parks,
5 recreational facilities, and event venues; and community
6 programs that provide for community-based economic development,
7 culture, arts, communication, safety, security, and cleanliness.
8 Too often, basic community infrastructure such as
9 sidewalks, safe multi-modal connectivity, public spaces,
10 community-based economic development, and amenities required for
11 successful, livable communities never materialize without a lead
12 agency taking ownership, prioritizing key community elements,
13 and executing projects. In most cases, basic community
14 infrastructure is not a priority for any department or agency.
15 Sometimes this results in costly retrofits after people move in,
16 discover gaps in their quality of life, and pay for missing
17 infrastructure needed to enable families to reduce their cost of
18 transportation and living. In other cases, basic community
19 infrastructure can no longer be implemented because buildout in
20 the area has already occurred, leaving residents stranded with
21 higher costs of living and no recourse. This results in

1 coirununities having a higher cost of living than necessary and
2 developments that are often sufficient for transient investment
3 units and vacation properties but not best-suited for local
4 families and permanent residents.
5 The legislature also finds that ensuring the inclusion of
6 complete community infrastructure in planning and implementation
7 can replicate four successful strategies commonly used in
8 successful cities to help significantly reduce the cost of
9 housing and cost of living. Primarily, these include
10 aggregating amenities such as parking and green space into
11 public space, removing those costs from each new development.
12 Secondly, constructing public infrastructure and properties that
13 generate revenue can help to pay for adequate infrastructure and
14 amenities implementation, as well as reduce the cost of
15 maintenance, security, and similar costs for area residents.
16 Thirdly, using financing mechanisms such as community financing
17 districts can provide more capacity to ensure that complete
18 community infrastructure and amenities are planned for and
19 included. Fourthly, constructing multiple lower-story concrete
20 or wood buildings on the same footprint of a tower or podium
21 project can achieve the same number of units on a block, but

1 through a much cheaper per-unit cost because lower structures do
2 not require costly vertical engineering and safety and related
3 components. In numerous other cities, these types of equally
4 dense but less expensive affordable housing developments are
5 often built by both the private and public sectors.
6 The legislature further finds that the two highest costs
7 contributing to the cost of living are housing and
8 transportation. By broadening the State’s focus to develop
9 affordable communities with fully built community infrastructure
10 and amenities, rather than just affordable housing, the cost of
11 a single unit can often be reduced by as much as $75,000, and
12 the cost of transportation for families living there can be
13 reduced by $15,000 or more per year.
14 Units in many recent housing projects have become
15 prohibitively expensive. On average, approximately $50,000 is
16 added to the cost of a unit per associated parking stall
17 constructed, and as much as $25,000 per unit is added for
18 associated building amenities. Numerous cities and
19 jurisdictions have begun constructing separate, aggregated
20 parking stalls and building amenities, lowering the cost of each
21 unit produced by as much as $75,000.

1 The legislature further finds that building infrastructure,
2 such as separate parking garages, allows residents in an area to
3 lease space or use a parking stall as may be needed, rather than
4 having the expense forced upon them through higher mortgage
5 costs. This is especially important considering that Hawaii's
6 latest generation is driving considerably less than previous
7 generations. Since 2000, the percentage of eighteen- to
8 twenty-nine-year-olds with a driver's license has decreased
9 nearly forty per cent. Many individuals desire to live in
10 walkable, bikeable communities without the costly average
11 expense of $10,000 per year for each additional vehicle along
12 with the $50,000 cost of owning a parking stall.
13 Additionally, relieving housing developers of the burden of
14 building excessive amenities and gathering spaces in each
15 building lowers the cost of living in those units. Aggregating
16 public spaces for open plazas, gathering spaces, parks, and
17 green spaces available to everyone also creates and fosters a
18 better sense of community and opportunities for better mixed-use
19 commercial, retail, and food options at a lower overall cost.
20 The legislature additionally finds that the most successful
21 affordable communities incorporate mixed-use commercial and
HB1007 CDl LRB 25-1833.docx

1 retail space into public projects, which not only puts daily
2 needs within walking distance of residents, but also provides
3 revenue-generating lease rent and other opportunities that can
4 help pay for community infrastructure, amenities, security,
5 cleanliness, and maintenance, and lower maintenance fees and the
6 cost of living for residents in the area.
7 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to empower the
8 Hawaii community development authority to implement these and
9 other proven strategies to build infrastructure and projects for
10 better, more affordable, more livable communities and provide
11 residents with a higher quality of life. Secondly, this Act
12 streamlines transit-oriented development infrastructure
13 improvements by recasting provisions of chapter 206E, part X,
14 Hawaii Revised Statutes, relating to transit-oriented
15 development infrastructure improvements, as a program under the
16 Hawaii community development authority. This will enable the
17 Hawaii community development authority to develop community
18 improvement projects in transit-oriented development areas
19 outside its existing designated districts, provided that
20 planning and implementation shall be assisted by a new board of
21 members having expertise with successful strategies commonly

1 employed elsewhere, rather than the existing multiple districts
2 and boards for each county.
3 This Act also provides additional financing tools and
4 flexibility to fill the gaps in Hawaii’s community planning and
5 implementation. This will provide better community improvements
6 and deliver complete communities with lower housing and
7 transportation costs, safer streets, public spaces, parks, and
8 community amenities that provide a better quality of life.
9 The legislature finds that the Hawaii community development
10 authority may begin to employ these new strategies and use these
11 new tools by assisting with the planning, development, and
12 implementation of the proposed park-and-ride transit and
13 community hub adjacent to the Skyline's Waiawa, Pearl Highlands
14 station on Oahu.
15 SECTION 2. Chapter 206E, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
16 amended by adding two new sections to be appropriately
17 designated and to read as follows:
18 "§206E- Issuance of bonds for the development of
19 infrastructure. (a) Notwithstanding section 206E-21 and
20 206E-225, the authority, pursuant to and in accordance with this

1 subpart and section 46-80.1(a), may issue bonds for the purpose
2 of financing the development of infrastructure for:
3 (1) Land owned by the authority or land within a community
4 development district or area established under this
5 chapter or the stadium development district
6 established in section 206E-223; and
7 Infrastructure projects under section 206E-246.
8 (b) All bonds issued by the authority for improvements by
9 assessments, and the interest thereon, shall be exempt from all
10 state, county, and municipal taxation, except inheritance,
11 transfer, and estate taxes.
12 §206E- Condemnation of real property. The authority,
13 upon making a finding that it is necessary to acquire any real
14 property for its immediate or future use for the purposes of
15 this part, may acquire the property by condemnation pursuant to
16 chapter 101. The property shall not thereafter be taken for any
17 other public use without the consent of the authority. No award
18 of compensation shall be increased by reason of any increase in
19 the value of real property caused by the designation of the
20 transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement program

1 areas, or the actual or proposed acquisition, use, or
2 disposition of any other real property by the authority."
3 SECTION 3. Section 206E-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
4 amended to read as follows:
5 "§206E-l Findings and purpose. The legislature finds that
6 many areas of the State are substantially undeveloped, blighted,
7 or economically depressed, and are or are potentially in need of
8 renewal, renovation, or improvement to alleviate such conditions
9 as dilapidation, deterioration, age, and other such factors or
10 conditions [whieh] that make [ouch] the areas an economic or
11 social liability.
12 The legislature further finds that there exists within the
13 State vast, unmet community development needs. These include,
14 but are not limited to, a lack of suitable affordable housing;
15 insufficient commercial and industrial facilities for rent;
16 residential areas [whiefe] that do not have facilities necessary
17 for basic liveability, such as parks and open space; [and] areas
18 [^diieh-] that are planned for extensive land allocation to one,
19 rather than mixed uses[—]; a lack of infrastructure necessary to
20 facilitate community development; and insufficient culturally

1 appropriate agriculture, education, and natural-resource
2 restoration and management.
3 It is further determined that the lack of planning and
4 coordination in such areas has given rise to these community
5 development needs and that existing laws and public and private
6 mechanisms have either proven incapable or inadequate to
7 facilitate timely redevelopment and renewal [-?-], or restoration
8 and management, as the case may be.
9 The legislature finds that a new and comprehensive
10 authority for community development must be created to join the
11 strengths of private enterprise, public development, and
12 regulation into a new form capable of long-range planning and
13 implementation of improved community development. The purpose
14 of this chapter is to establish such a mechanism in the Hawaii
15 community development authority, which is a public entity
16 [whieb] that shall determine community development programs ar^
17 projects and cooperate with private enterprise and the various
18 components of federal, state, and county governments in bringing
19 plans and projects to fruition. [For ouch arcuo dcoignated ao

1 Hawaii community development authority will result in
2 communities [whieh] that serve the highest needs and aspirations
3 of Hawaii's people.
4 The legislature finds that the creation of the Hawaii
5 community development authority, the establishment of community
6 development districts[7—and] and program areas, the issuance of
7 bonds pursuant to this chapter to finance public facilities, and
8 the ability of the Hawaii community development authority to
9 cooperate with or assist public and private sector entities to
10 engage in projects that improve the State, serve the public
11 interest and are matters of statewide concern.
12 The legislature also finds that there are many areas of the
13 State, outside of the Hawaii community development authority's
14 community development districts, where this comprehensive
15 planning, and redevelopment agency should use its powers to
16 facilitate timely redevelopment, renewal, community building,
17 and economic development."
18 SECTION 4. Section 206E-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
19 amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows:

1 renewal and redevelopment of areas designated by the State and

3 development is a powerful tool that can ultimately deliver a
4 wide range of social, environmental, and economic benefits.
5 Transit-oriented development promotes development patterns that
6 support quality of life, preserves the natural environment,
7 provides a range of housing choices for residents, and
8 encourages walking, biking, and use of mass transit. The State
9 plays an important role in overcoming barriers to
10 transit-oriented development, including encouraging needed
11 investments in improving regional infrastructure such as roads,
12 sewers, water, power, communication, and storm water management
13 systems. This part is intended to move transit-oriented
14 development planning efforts forward into infrastructure
15 improvements that benefit the community. The legislature
16 further finds that, currently, no single state agency has the
17 authority to improve infrastructure along a transit corridor in
18 the best interest of the State. This part will enable the
19 delivery of infrastructure needed to support development on
20 lands within designated transit-oriented development zones.

A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO THE HAWAII COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that Act 184, Session
2 Laws of Hawaii 2022 (Act 184), which established
3 transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement
4 districts, could be more efficient and effective. The
5 transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement
6 districts comprised the land within county-designated
7 transit-oriented development zones or within a one-half mile
8 radius of a proposed or existing transit station if the county
9 has not designated transit-oriented development zones, as
10 designated by the board. Act 184 also established the
11 transit-oriented development infrastructure improvement district
12 boards for each county, under the Hawaii community development
13 authority for administrative purposes. To date, these boards
14 have not been constituted, due in part to a lack of community
15 volunteers willing to serve.
16 The legislature further finds that the best-proven models
17 of successful, affordable, healthy, and vibrant communities in

C.D. 1
1 transit-oriented development areas require sufficient water,
2 sewer, and power infrastructure; affordable housing; safe,
3 comfortable, and convenient pedestrian and multi-modal transit
4 connectivity; meaningful community amenities such as parks,
5 recreational facilities, and event venues; and community
6 programs that provide for community-based economic development,
7 culture, arts, communication, safety, security, and cleanliness.
8 Too often, basic community infrastructure such as
9 sidewalks, safe multi-modal connectivity, public spaces,
10 community-based economic development, and amenities required for
11 successful, livable communities never materialize without a lead
12 agency taking ownership, prioritizing key community elements,
13 and executing projects. In most cases, basic community
14 infrastructure is not a priority for any department or agency.
15 Sometimes this results in costly retrofits after people move in,
16 discover gaps in their quality of life, and pay for missing
17 infrastructure needed to enable families to reduce their cost of
18 transportation and living. In other cases, basic community
19 infrastructure can no longer be implemented because buildout in
20 the area has already occurred, leaving residents stranded with
21 higher costs of living and no recourse. This results in

1 coirununities having a higher cost of living than necessary and
2 developments that are often sufficient for transient investment
3 units and vacation properties but not best-suited for local
4 families and permanent residents.
5 The legislature also finds that ensuring the inclusion of
6 complete community infrastructure in planning and implementation
7 can replicate four successful strategies commonly used in
8 successful cities to help significantly reduce the cost of
9 housing and cost of living. Primarily, these include
10 aggregating amenities such as parking and green space into
11 public space, removing those costs from each new development.
12 Secondly, constructing public infrastructure and properties that
13 generate revenue can help to pay for adequate infrastructure and
14 amenities implementation, as well as reduce the cost of
15 maintenance, security, and similar costs for area residents.
16 Thirdly, using financing mechanisms such as community financing
17 districts can provide more capacity to ensure that complete
18 community infrastructure and amenities are planned for and
19 included. Fourthly, constructing multiple lower-story concrete
20 or wood buildings on the same footprint of a tower or podium
21 project can achieve the same number of units on a block, but

1 through a much cheaper per-unit cost because lower structures do
2 not require costly vertical engineering and safety and related
3 components. In numerous other cities, these types of equally
4 dense but less expensive affordable housing developments are
5 often built by both the private and public sectors.
6 The legislature further finds that the two highest costs
7 contributing to the cost of living are housing and
8 transportation. By broadening the State’s focus to develop
9 affordable communities with fully built community infrastructure
10 and amenities, rather than just affordable housing, the cost of
11 a single unit can often be reduced by as much as $75,000, and
12 the cost of transportation for families living there can be
13 reduced by $15,000 or more per year.
14 Units in many recent housing projects have become
15 prohibitively expensive. On average, approximately $50,000 is
16 added to the cost of a unit per associated parking stall
17 constructed, and as much as $25,000 per unit is added for
18 associated building amenities. Numerous cities and
19 jurisdictions have begun constructing separate, aggregated
20 parking stalls and building amenities, lowering the cost of each
21 unit produced by as much as $75,000.
HB1007 GDI LRB 25-1833.docx

C.D. 1
1 The legislature further finds that building infrastructure,
2 such as separate parking garages, allows residents in an area to
3 lease space or use a parking stall as may be needed, rather than
4 having the expense forced upon them through higher mortgage
5 costs. This is especially important considering that Hawaii's
6 latest generation is driving considerably less than previous
7 generations. Since 2000, the percentage of eighteen- to
8 twenty-nine-year-olds with a driver's license has decreased
9 nearly forty per cent. Many individuals desire to live in
10 walkable, bikeable communities without the costly average
11 expense of $10,000 per year for each additional vehicle along
12 with the $50,000 cost of owning a parking stall.
13 Additionally, relieving housing developers of the burden of
14 building excessive amenities and gathering spaces in each
15 building lowers the cost of living in those units. Aggregating
16 public spaces for open plazas, gathering spaces, parks, and
17 green spaces available to everyone also creates and fosters a
18 better sense of community and opportunities for better mixed-use
19 commercial, retail, and food options at a lower overall cost.
20 The legislature additionally finds that the most successful
21 affordable communities incorporate mixed-use commercial and
HB1007 CDl LRB 25-1833.docx

1 retail space into public projects, which not only puts daily
2 needs within walking distance of residents, but also provides
3 revenue-generating lease rent and other opportunities that can
4 help pay for community infrastructure, amenities, security,
5 cleanliness, and maintenance, and lower maintenance fees and the
6 cost of living for residents in the area.
7 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to empower the
8 Hawaii community development authority to implement these and
9 other proven strategies to build infrastructure and projects for
10 better, more affordable, more livable communities and provide
11 residents with a higher quality of life. Secondly, this Act
12 streamlines transit-oriented development infrastructure
13 improvements by recasting provisions of chapter 206E, part X,
14 Hawaii Revised Statutes, relating to transit-oriented
15 development infrastructure improvements, as a program under the
16 Hawaii community development authority. This will enable the
17 Hawaii community development authority to develop community
18 improvement projects in transit-oriented development areas
19 outside its existing designated districts, provided that
20 planning and implementation shall be assisted by a new board of
21 members having expertise with successful strategies commonly

1 employed elsewhere, rather than the existing multiple districts
2 and boards for each county.
3 This Act also provides additional financing tools and
4 flexibility to fill the gaps in Hawaii’s community planning and
5 implementation. This will provide better community improvements
6 and deliver complete communities with lower housing and
7 transportation costs, safer streets, public spaces, parks, and
8 community amenities that provide a better quality of life.
9 The legislature finds that the Hawaii community development
10 authority may begin to employ these new strategies and use these
11 new tools by assisting with the planning, development, and
12 implementation of the proposed park-and-ride transit and
13 community hub adjacent to the Skyline's Waiawa, Pearl Highlands
14 station on Oahu.
15 SECTION 2. Chapter 206E, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
16 amended by adding two new sections to be appropriately
17 designated and to read as follows:
18 "§206E- Issuance of bonds for the development of
19 infrastructure. (a) Notwithstanding section 206E-21 and
20 206E-225, the authority, pursuant to and in accordance with this

1 subpart and section 46-80.1(a), may issue bonds for the purpose
2 of financing the development of infrastructure for:
3 (1) Land owned by the authority or land within a community
4 development district or area established under this
5 chapter or the stadium development district
6 established in section 206E-223; and
7 Infrastructure projects under section 206E-246.
8 (b) All bonds issued by the authority for improvements by
9 assessments, and the interest thereon, shall be exempt from all

3 SECTION 3. Section 206E-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
4 amended to read as follows:
5 "§206E-l Findings and purpose. The legislature finds that
6 many areas of the State are substantially undeveloped, blighted,
7 or economically depressed, and are or are potentially in need of
8 renewal, renovation, or improvement to alleviate such conditions
9 as dilapidation, deterioration, age, and other such factors or
10 conditions [whieh] that make [ouch] the areas an economic or
11 social liability.
12 The legislature further finds that there exists within the
13 State vast, unmet community development needs. These include,
14 but are not limited to, a lack of suitable affordable housing;
15 insufficient commercial and industrial facilities for rent;
16 residential areas [whiefe] that do not have facilities necessary
17 for basic liveability, such as parks and open space; [and] areas
18 [^diieh-] that are planned for extensive land allocation to one,
19 rather than mixed uses[—]; a lack of infrastructure necessary to
20 facilitate community development; and insufficient culturally

1 appropriate agriculture, education, and natural-resource
2 restoration and management.
3 It is further determined that the lack of planning and
4 coordination in such areas has given rise to these community
5 development needs and that existing laws and public and private
6 mechanisms have either proven incapable or inadequate to
7 facilitate timely redevelopment and renewal [-?-], or restoration
8 and management, as the case may be.
9 The legislature finds that a new and comprehensive
10 authority for community development must be created to join the
11 strengths of private enterprise, public development, and
12 regulation into a new form capable of long-range planning and
13 implementation of improved community development. The purpose
14 of this chapter is to establish such a mechanism in the Hawaii
15 community development authority, which is a public entity
16 [whieb] that shall determine community development programs ar^
17 projects and cooperate with private enterprise and the various
18 components of federal, state, and county governments in bringing
19 plans and projects to fruition. [For ouch arcuo dcoignated ao

1 Hawaii community development authority will result in
2 communities [whieh] that serve the highest needs and aspirations
3 of Hawaii's people.
4 The legislature finds that the creation of the Hawaii
5 community development authority, the establishment of community
6 development districts[7—and] and program areas, the issuance of
7 bonds pursuant to this chapter to finance public facilities, and
8 the ability of the Hawaii community development authority to
9 cooperate with or assist public and private sector entities to
10 engage in projects that improve the State, serve the public
11 interest and are matters of statewide concern.
12 The legislature also finds that there are many areas of the
13 State, outside of the Hawaii community development authority's
14 community development districts, where this comprehensive
15 planning, and redevelopment agency should use its powers to
16 facilitate timely redevelopment, renewal, community building,
17 and economic development."
18 SECTION 4. Section 206E-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
19 amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows:

1 renewal and redevelopment of areas designated by the State and
2 the counties for transit-oriented development. Transit-oriented
3 development is a powerful tool that can ultimately deliver a
4 wide range of social, environmental, and economic benefits.
5 Transit-oriented development promotes development patterns that
6 support quality of life, preserves the natural environment,
7 provides a range of housing choices for residents, and
8 encourages walking, biking, and use of mass transit. The State
9 plays an important role in overcoming barriers to
10 transit-oriented development, including encouraging needed
11 investments in improving regional infrastructure such as roads,
12 sewers, water, power, communication, and storm water management
13 systems. This part is intended to move transit-oriented
14 development planning efforts forward into infrastructure
15 improvements that benefit the community. The legislature
16 further finds that, currently, no single state agency has the
17 authority to improve infrastructure along a transit corridor in
18 the best interest of the State. This part will enable the
19 delivery of infrastructure needed to support development on
20 lands within designated transit-oriented development zones.
