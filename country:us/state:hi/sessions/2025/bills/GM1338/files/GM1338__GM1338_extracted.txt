2 the public generally. It is hereby found that regulation by the
3 department of agriculture and biosecurity and cooperation by
4 this State with the United States Department of Agriculture as
5 contemplated by this Hawaii Meat Inspection Act is appropriate
6 to protect the health and welfare of consumers and otherwise to
7 effectuate the purposes of this chapter.
8 Congress enacted the Meat Inspection Act in 1907 (Public
9 Law 59-242), as amended by the Wholesome Meat Act in 1967
10 (Public Law 90-201) which is now redesignated as the Federal
11 Meat Inspection Act. The Federal Meat Inspection Act is
12 intended to protect the consuming public from adulterated or
13 misbranded meat and meat products and to assist the states in
14 their efforts to accomplish this objective. The Federal Meat
15 Inspection Act authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to
16 furnish financial and related assistance to states for the
17 administration of meat inspection programs which conform to
18 established federal standards up to fifty per cent of the
19 estimated total cost of the cooperative program. Presently, the
20 meat processing industry in this State is not subject to any
21 meat inspection law or rules and regulations that meet the

3 "progressive action" by November 15, 1969; and, further, all
4 physical facilities must be upgraded in accordance with the
5 established federal standards by November 15, 1970. Failure to
6 comply with the federal standards prescribed by the Federal Meat
7 Inspection Act will result in federal control of the meat and
8 meat processing industries of the State. Accordingly, the State
9 deems it to be in the best interest of the public health and
10 welfare to take those steps as are necessary to qualify for
11 federal financial and related assistance for the administration
12 of a meat inspection program which conforms to federal standards
13 prescribed in the Federal Meat Inspection Act."
14 SECTION 13. Section 161-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is

8 losses to poultry producers and processors of poultry as well as
9 injury to consumers. The unwholesome, adulterated, mislabeled,
10 or deceptively packaged articles can be sold at lower prices and
11 compete unfairly with the wholesome, not adulterated, and
12 properly labeled and packaged articles, to the detriment of
13 consumers and the public generally. It is hereby found that

5 Secretary of Agriculture to furnish financial and related
6 assistance to states for the administration of poultry
7 inspection programs which conform to established federal
8 standards up to fifty per cent of the estimated total cost of
9 the cooperative program. Hawaii's poultry industry is not
10 subject to poultry inspection law or rules and regulations that
11 meet the minimum federal requirement in this area. In order to
12 qualify for the cooperative program, the State must demonstrate
13 "progressive action" by July 18, 1970; and, further, all
14 physical facilities must be upgraded in accordance with the
15 established federal standards by July 18, 1971. Failure to
16 comply with the standards prescribed by the Poultry Products
17 Inspection Act will result in federal control of the poultry or
18 poultry processing industries of the State. Accordingly, the
19 State of Hawaii deems it to be in the interest of the State's
20 public health and welfare to take [such] steps as are necessary

15 facilities. At the transitional facility, a private individual
16 licensed by the government inspects the goods for disease,
17 infection, infestation, and other matters of concern.
18 The legislature further finds that New Zealand's process
19 allows for a more efficient flow of goods entering the country
20 by reducing delays or stoppages at the ports of entry while also

3 SECTION 12. Section 159-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
4 amended to read as follows:
5 " [-bl §^59-2 [j-] Findings and declaration of necessity. It
6 is hereby declared that the meat industry is a paramount
7 agricultural industry of this State and the production and
8 marketing of meat is an enterprise that is of significant
9 importance to the economy of this State and to the health of the
10 consuming public. It is essential to the public health and
11 welfare of consumers that they be protected by assuring that
12 meat and meat products distributed to them are wholesome, not
13 adulterated, and properly marked, labeled, and packaged.
14 Unwholesome, adulterated, or misbranded meat or meat products
15 are injurious to the public health and welfare, destroy markets
16 for wholesome, unadulterated, and properly labeled and packaged
17 meat and meat products and result in sundry losses to livestock
18 producers and processors of meat and meat products, as well as
19 injury to consumers. The unwholesome, adulterated, mislabeled,
20 or deceptively packaged articles can be sold at lower prices and
21 compete unfairly with the wholesome, unadulterated, and properly

C.D. 1
1 labeled and packaged articles, to the detriment of consumers and
2 the public generally. It is hereby found that regulation by the
3 department of agriculture and biosecurity and cooperation by
4 this State with the United States Department of Agriculture as
5 contemplated by this Hawaii Meat Inspection Act is appropriate
6 to protect the health and welfare of consumers and otherwise to
7 effectuate the purposes of this chapter.
8 Congress enacted the Meat Inspection Act in 1907 (Public
9 Law 59-242), as amended by the Wholesome Meat Act in 1967
10 (Public Law 90-201) which is now redesignated as the Federal
11 Meat Inspection Act. The Federal Meat Inspection Act is
12 intended to protect the consuming public from adulterated or
13 misbranded meat and meat products and to assist the states in
14 their efforts to accomplish this objective. The Federal Meat
15 Inspection Act authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to
16 furnish financial and related assistance to states for the
17 administration of meat inspection programs which conform to
18 established federal standards up to fifty per cent of the
19 estimated total cost of the cooperative program. Presently, the
20 meat processing industry in this State is not subject to any
21 meat inspection law or rules and regulations that meet the
2025-3271 HB427 CDl HMSO iz

C.D. 1
1 minimum federal requirement in this area. This State, in order
2 to qualify for the cooperative program, must demonstrate
3 "progressive action" by November 15, 1969; and, further, all
4 physical facilities must be upgraded in accordance with the
5 established federal standards by November 15, 1970. Failure to
6 comply with the federal standards prescribed by the Federal Meat
7 Inspection Act will result in federal control of the meat and
8 meat processing industries of the State. Accordingly, the State

14 SECTION 13. Section 161-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
15 amended to read as follows:
16 "§161-2 Findings and declaration of necessity. It is
17 hereby declared that the poultry industry is a paramount

1 welfare of consumers that they be protected by assuring that
2 poultry or poultry products distributed to them are wholesome,
3 not adulterated, and properly marked, labeled, and packaged.
4 Unwholesome, adulterated, or misbranded poultry or poultry
5 products are injurious to the public health and welfare, destroy
6 markets for wholesome, not adulterated, and properly labeled and
7 packaged poultry or poultry products, and result in sundry
8 losses to poultry producers and processors of poultry as well as
9 injury to consumers. The unwholesome, adulterated, mislabeled,
10 or deceptively packaged articles can be sold at lower prices and
11 compete unfairly with the wholesome, not adulterated, and
12 properly labeled and packaged articles, to the detriment of
13 consumers and the public generally. It is hereby found that
14 regulation by the department of agriculture and biosecurity and
15 cooperation by this State with the United States Department of
16 Agriculture as contemplated by this chapter is appropriate to
17 protect the health and welfare of consumers and otherwise to
18 effectuate the purposes of this chapter.

20 Wholesome Poultry Products Act", which is now redesignated as

1 Inspection Act is intended to protect the consuming public from
2 adulterated or misbranded poultry or poultry products and to
3 assist the states in their efforts to accomplish this objective.
4 The Poultry Products Inspection Act authorizes the United States
5 Secretary of Agriculture to furnish financial and related
6 assistance to states for the administration of poultry
7 inspection programs which conform to established federal
8 standards up to fifty per cent of the estimated total cost of
9 the cooperative program. Hawaii's poultry industry is not
10 subject to poultry inspection law or rules and regulations that
11 meet the minimum federal requirement in this area. In order to
12 qualify for the cooperative program, the State must demonstrate
13 "progressive action" by July 18, 1970; and, further, all
14 physical facilities must be upgraded in accordance with the
15 established federal standards by July 18, 1971. Failure to
16 comply with the standards prescribed by the Poultry Products
17 Inspection Act will result in federal control of the poultry or
18 poultry processing industries of the State. Accordingly, the
19 State of Hawaii deems it to be in the interest of the State's
20 public health and welfare to take [such] steps as are necessary

8 PART IV
9 SECTION 25. The legislature finds that New Zealand's use
10 of transitional facilities has increased the country's
11 biosecurity while improving the efficiency of importing goods.
12 In New Zealand, most imported goods subject to inspection are
13 transported away from the airport or seaport to one of six
14 thousand five hundred privately-run secure transitional
15 facilities. At the transitional facility, a private individual
16 licensed by the government inspects the goods for disease,
17 infection, infestation, and other matters of concern.
18 The legislature further finds that New Zealand's process
19 allows for a more efficient flow of goods entering the country
20 by reducing delays or stoppages at the ports of entry while also
