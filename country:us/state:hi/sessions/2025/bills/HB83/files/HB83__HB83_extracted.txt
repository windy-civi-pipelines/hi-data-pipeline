Section 1:
HB83 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 83 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to fireworks. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1. The legislature finds that while existing law classifies the purchase, possession, storage, or use of fireworks without a valid permit as a class C felony, there is an urgent need to enhance these penalties to serve as a more effective deterrent.  The illegal use of fireworks poses significant risks to public safety, including physical injuries, property damage, and environmental harm. Additionally, the noise and disruption caused by illegal fireworks are a source of distress for many residents. The legislature further finds that despite existing penalties, enforcement challenges and repeat offenses suggest that current consequences are not sufficient to prevent illegal firework activity. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Increase penalties relating to illegal fireworks and establish higher penalties for any subsequent violation; and (2)  Appropriates funds. SECTION 2.  Section 132D-14, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended as by amending subsection (a) to read as follows: "(a) Any person: (1)  Importing aerial devices, display fireworks, or articles pyrotechnic without having a valid license under section 132D-7 shall be guilty of a class [C] B felony[;] for the first violation and for any subsequent violation shall be guilty of a class A felony; (2)  Purchasing, possessing, setting off, igniting, or discharging aerial devices, display fireworks, or articles pyrotechnic without a valid permit under sections 132D-10 and 132D-16, or storing, selling, or possessing aerial devices, display fireworks, or articles pyrotechnic without a valid license under section 132D-7, or allowing an individual to possess, set off, ignite, discharge, or otherwise cause to explode any aerial device in violation of section 132D-14.5: (A)  If the total weight of the aerial devices, display fireworks, or articles pyrotechnic is twenty-five pounds or more, shall be guilty of a class [C] B felony[;] for the first violation and for any subsequent violation shall be guilty of a class A felony; or (B)  If the total weight of the aerial devices, display fireworks, or articles pyrotechnic is less than twenty-five pounds, shall be guilty of a [misdemeanor;] class C felony for the first violation and for any subsequent violation shall be guilty of a class B felony; (3)  Who transfers or sells aerial devices, display fireworks, or articles pyrotechnic to a person who does not have a valid permit under sections 132D-10 and 132D-16, shall be guilty of a class [C] B felony[;] for the first violation and for any subsequent violation shall be guilty of a class A felony; and (4)  Who removes or extracts the pyrotechnic contents from any fireworks or articles pyrotechnic and uses the contents to construct fireworks, articles pyrotechnic, or a fireworks or articles pyrotechnic related device shall be guilty of a [misdemeanor.] class C felony for the first violation and for any subsequent violation shall be guilty of a class B felony."
