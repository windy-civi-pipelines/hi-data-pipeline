Dear President Kouchi, Speaker Nakamura, and Members of the Legislature:
This is to inform you that on April 10, 2025, the following bill was signed into law:
SB1291 SD1 RELATING TO CERTIFIED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTANTS.
ACT 014
Sincerely,
Josh Green, M.D.

THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that business and
2 commerce continue to grow more complicated, increasing the need
3 for well-gualified certified public accountants in the State and
4 nationwide. At the same time, however, a declining percentage
5 of students in accounting classes are pursuing certified public
6 accountant (CPA) licenses. In part, this decline is due to the
7 reguirement of thirty additional semester hours of education,
8 beyond the requirements of a bachelor's degree, to obtain a CPA
9 license. The time and monetary costs of this additional
10 education can be a serious obstacle for many students. Thus,
11 the additional education requirement effectively blocks many
12 potential candidates from obtaining CPA licenses, at a time when
13 more qualified CPAs are needed.
14 The purpose of this Act is to generate more qualified CPAs
15 by establishing alternative pathways to licensure that eliminate
16 certain barriers for eligible applicants.
