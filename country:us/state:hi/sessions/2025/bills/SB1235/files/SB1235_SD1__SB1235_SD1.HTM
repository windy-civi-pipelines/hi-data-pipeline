Section 1:
SB1235 SD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1235 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO HOUSING. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that it is becoming increasingly difficult to recruit and retain state employees.  Having affordable rental and homeownership opportunities for state employees will reduce the resignation and outmigration of state employees and fill critical labor needs throughout state government. The legislature further finds that with Honolulu's construction of an elevated rail transit system, the State has an opportunity to enhance Oahu's urban environment and increase the quality of life for residents by increasing the affordable housing inventory and eliminating the need for personal automobiles, among other public benefits.  As the largest landowner of transit-oriented development sites along the transit line in Honolulu, as well as being the landowner of other transit-oriented development sites in each of the other counties, the State and its various departments and attached agencies must be proactive in establishing a unified vision and approach toward redevelopment of its transit-oriented development sites statewide to maximize the benefits of state lands available for redevelopment. The purpose of this Act is to establish within the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation: (1)  An affordable housing program to facilitate the creation of low-cost rental, leasehold residential, and for-sale units to government employees on state‑owned land; and (2)  A government employee housing revolving fund to provide interim and permanent financing for the infrastructure, pre-development, development, and construction costs of projects developed under the affordable housing program. SECTION 2.  Chapter 201H, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "PART     .  GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE HOUSING A.  General Provisions §201H-    Definitions. As used in this part: "Mixed-use project" means a mixed-use development as defined in section 201H-12(a). "Mixed-use transit-oriented development project" means a mixed-use project on a transit-oriented development site. "Owner-occupied residential use" means any use currently permitted in existing residential zones consistent with owner occupancy. "Owner-occupied residential use" does not include renting or subleasing by the owner of a residential condominium unit to any tenant or sublessee. "Project" means a specific work or improvement, including real and personal properties, or any interest therein, acquired, owned, constructed, reconstructed, rehabilitated, or improved by the corporation, including a commercial project, redevelopment project, residential project, or mixed-use project. "Transit-oriented development site" means non-ceded state‑owned lands within a one-mile radius of a planned or existing station connected to a locally preferred alternative for a mass transit project. §201H-    Annual reports.  The corporation shall submit an annual report to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular session describing the projects funded, a description of proposals submitted under this part and action taken on the proposals, and any barriers to developing housing units under this part.
