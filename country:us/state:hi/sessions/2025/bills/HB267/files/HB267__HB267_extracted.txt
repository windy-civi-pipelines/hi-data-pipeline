HB267 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 267 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to school safety. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training and access to automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are essential to school safety at sporting events.  Thirty-one states across the nation require coaches receive CPR training.  Unfortunately, Hawaii is not one of them.  Seventy per cent of students who experience cardiac arrest in a school with an AED survive.  This is a significant increase from the average rate of survival.  Every minute that passes without AED intervention decreases the survival rate by ten per cent.  Further, schools should be equipped with other lifesaving measures such as Narcan, EpiPens, and inhalers. The purpose of this Act is to mandate that: (1)  Each sporting event of 25 or more participants have a CPR trained coach or athletic trainer in attendance; and (2)  All schools be equipped with AED devices, Narcan, EpiPens, and inhalers. SECTION 2.  Chapter 302A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§302A‑ Life-saving measures; CPR; requirements; training. (a)  By the end of the 2025-2026 school year: (1)  All public schools shall have a minimum of two automated external defibrillators: (A)  One to be situated in a permanent location on campus; and (B)  One to be utilized for organized sporting events of 25 or more participants; (2)  All public schools shall be equipped with Narcan, EpiPens, and inhalers; (3)  All public schools that have an athletic trainer shall ensure that at every sporting event of 25 or more participants, an additional automated external defibrillator is available, and the athletic trainer is trained and certified at all times in the use of automated external defibrillators; and (4)  All public schools that do not have an athletic trainer shall ensure that at every sporting event of 25 or more participants, at all times at least two faculty members of the school in attendance are trained and certified in the use of automated external defibrillators. (b)  The department shall ensure that the automated external defibrillators are: (1)  Maintained and regularly tested according to the operation and maintenance guidelines set forth by the manufacturer; and (2)  Checked for readiness after each use and at least once every thirty days if the automated external defibrillator has not been used in the preceding thirty days; provided that records of the checks shall be maintained by the department and the individual school. (c)  Beginning with the 2025-2026 school year, the department shall offer a mandatory CPR training for athletic trainers and coaches at the beginning of each academic year. (d)  For purposes of this section, "sporting event" includes competitions, scrimmages, and practices." SECTION 3.  Chapter 302D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§302D‑    Life-saving measures; CPR; requirements; training.

(d)  For purposes of this section, "sporting event" includes competitions, scrimmages, and practices." SECTION 4.  Chapter 304A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§304A‑    Life-saving measures; requirements; training.  (a)  By the end of the 2025-2026 school year: (1)  All divisions and campuses of the University of Hawaii system shall have an automated external defibrillator situated in a permanent location on campus; and (2)  The athletic department of the University of Hawaii, with regard to each institution under the University of Hawaii system, shall ensure that: (A)  There is an automated external defibrillator available to the athletic trainer present at every sporting event of 25 or more participants; and (B)  At all times, every athletic trainer is trained and certified in the use of automated external defibrillators; and (3)  All divisions and campuses of the University of Hawaii system shall be equipped with Narcan, EpiPens, and inhalers.
