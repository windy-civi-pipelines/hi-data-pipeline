A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO LOCAL AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that supporting local
2 agriculture and strengthening local food systems are a matter of
3 statewide concern that can improve the resilience of Hawaii's
4 economy, environment, culture, and public health. The
5 legislature further finds that setting clear and ambitious
6 target goals for the purchase of locally grown food ensures that
7 the State plays its role in supporting local farmers and
8 guarantees that revenue derived from local produce remains in
9 the State and feeds local people. Act 175, Session Laws of
10 Hawaii 2021 (Act 175), established a programmatic goal for the
11 department of education to provide a minimum of thirty per cent
12 locally sourced food in Hawaii public school meals by 2030. In
13 addition, the legislature also passed Act 176, Session Laws of
14 Hawaii 2021, and Act 144, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022, which
15 established five-year benchmarks ensuring a certain percentage
16 of produce that is purchased by the department of education,
17 department of health, department of public safety (now the

1 department of corrections and rehabilitation), department of
2 defense, and university of Hawaii system is locally grown.
3 The legislature also finds that the existing goals set
4 different standards for various state departments.
5 Specifically, pursuant to Act 175, Session Laws of Hawaii 2021,
6 the programmatic goal for the department of education is to
7 locally source at least thirty per cent of food served in public
8 schools by 2030, which is higher than other state departments.
9 The legislature believes that the goals to provide
10 locally-sourced food should increase at a consistent and
11 predictable pace across all pertinent state departments to avoid
12 any confusion between departments; however, the legislature
13 recognizes that benchmark goals for certain departments should
14 be assessed on a more frequent basis than the department of
15 education.
16 The purpose of this Act is to resolve some of the
17 discrepancies between the locally sourced food benchmarks for
18 the department of education and those of other state entities.
19 SECTION 2. Section 27-8, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
20 amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:
