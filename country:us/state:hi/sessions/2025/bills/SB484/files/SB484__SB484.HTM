Section 1:
SB484 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 484 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to transportation. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the single greatest recent factor contributing to the increasing cost of living in Hawaii is the rising cost of transportation. Due to increasingly expensive fossil fuels and a lack of cheaper transit options, Hawaii residents pay among the highest costs to commute in the country.  In January 2022, the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that auto-related costs were an astonishing twenty-three per cent higher than the year before. The legislature also finds that electric bicycles are significantly more cost effective for local families, better for the environment than gas-powered motor vehicles, and can effectively get many Hawaii residents to locations as conveniently as gas-powered motor vehicles.  The current electric bicycle and moped rebate program, even with minimal promotion and low subsidy, has helped almost three hundred people access electric bikes since its inception.  However, its reach has been limited by age restrictions and a lower rebate than other similar programs that does not afford access to many lower-income families. In 2022, Denver's electric bike rebate program, which provided families with up to a $1,200 rebate, led to considerable cost savings for Denver families, helped reduce vehicular traffic on crowded roads, and ultimately replaced many trips by car with trips by bike.  This meant twenty-two miles a week on average per user, collectively displacing one hundred thousand miles weekly.  Ninety-six per cent of users surveyed said the availability of the rebate made the difference when deciding to buy an electric bike. The purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Help reduce the cost of transportation, the cost of living, and traffic on Hawaii's roads by improving the existing electric bicycle and moped rebate program to further encourage the purchase and use of adaptive electric bicycles, electric bicycles, electric mopeds, and other electric mobility devices; and (2)  Update the definitions of "electric mobility device" and "electric bicycle" to align with federal and state policies and programs. SECTION 2.  Section 196-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding four new definitions to be appropriately inserted and to read as follows: ""Adaptive electric bicycle" means any bicycle that is modified to fit the needs of an individual rider who is unable to use a standard electric bicycle. "Electric bicycle" means a bicycle equipped with fully operable pedals, a saddle or seat for the rider, and an electric motor of seven hundred fifty watts or less that meets the requirements of one of the following three classes: (1)  Class 1 electric bicycle, which is an electric bicycle equipped with a motor that provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling, and that ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches the speed of twenty miles per hour; (2)  Class 2 electric bicycle, which is an electric bicycle equipped with a motor that may be used exclusively to propel the bicycle, and that is not capable of providing assistance when the bicycle reaches the speed of twenty miles per hour; or (3)  Class 3 electric bicycle, which is an electric bicycle equipped with a motor that provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling, and that ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches the speed of twenty-eight miles per hour. "Electric micro-mobility device" means any ground transportation device, such as a standing scooter, skateboard, board riding on a single or double wheels, or similar device, that is powered either exclusively by electricity from a battery charged from an external source, or by electricity from a battery charged from an external source in addition to human power, which is designed to transport a single person, with a range no less than twelve miles and maximum speed of twenty-eight miles per hour, on which a person may reasonably commute to and from regular destinations. "Electric mobility device" means an adaptive electric bicycle, electric bicycle, electric micro-mobility device, or electric mopeds." SECTION 3.  Section 196-7.8, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "[[]§196-7.8[]] Electric [bicycle and electric moped] mobility device rebate program; third-party administrator; special fund.  (a) The department of transportation shall administer a rebate program that incentivizes the purchase of new electric [bicycles and new electric mopeds] mobility devices and may contract with a third-party administrator pursuant to subsection [(i)] (k) to operate and manage the rebate program. (b)  Each eligible purchase of a new electric bicycle [or new], electric moped, adaptive electric bicycle, or electric micro-mobility device shall receive a rebate of [either twenty per cent of the retail cost or $500, whichever amount is lower;] $750; provided that no individual shall receive more than [$500] $750 in total rebates each fiscal year[.] unless also qualifying for the additional assistance rebate pursuant to subsection (j), in which case no individual shall receive more than $1,500 in total rebates each fiscal year.  No non-profit organization shall receive more than $10,000 in total rebates each fiscal year. (c)  The department of transportation shall not issue more than [$700,000] $2,000,000 in total rebates under this section each fiscal year; provided that the electric [bicycle and electric moped] mobility device subaccount within the highway development special fund pursuant to section 264-122(d) contains sufficient funds to pay the rebates.  The department of transportation shall not be liable to pay any refund if sufficient funds are unavailable.  The department of transportation shall allow valid claims filed by eligible applicants for whom sufficient funds may not be immediately available to receive a rebate as funds may be available in a subsequent year. (d)  The department of transportation shall: (1)  Prepare any forms that may be necessary for an applicant to claim a rebate pursuant to this section; and (2)  Require each applicant to furnish reasonable information to ascertain the validity of the claim, including but not limited to [the signature of the buyer and individual responsible for the sale on behalf of a retail store at the time of sale,] a copy of valid government issued photo identification of the buyer at the time of the sale, receipt of purchase, name and address of the retail store, verification of eligibility, and any other documentation necessary to demonstrate the legitimate purchase of a new electric [bicycle or new electric moped.] mobility device. (e) The department of transportation may establish a retailer application and portal to provide rebates directly at the point of sale to expedite the rebate process. [(e)] (f)  This section shall apply to new: (1)  Electric bicycles [capable of speeds of no more than twenty-eight miles per hour; and]; (2)  Electric mopeds[,]; (3)  Adaptive electric bicycles; and (4)  Electric micro-mobility devices, purchased at a retail store after July 1, 2022. [(f)] (g)  Applicants shall submit an application to the department of transportation within twelve months of the date of purchase to claim a rebate from the electric [bicycle and electric moped] mobility device rebate program.  Failure to apply within twelve months of the date of purchase shall constitute a waiver of the right to claim the rebate. [(g)] (h)  Nothing in this section shall alter taxes due on the original purchase. Any rebate received pursuant to this section shall not be considered income for the purposes of state or county taxes. (i) In administering the electric mobility device rebate program, the department of transportation shall provide rebates to: (1)  Persons who are residents of the State and fifteen years or older, who purchase a new qualifying electric bicycle, electric moped, adaptive electric bicycle, or electric micro-mobility device; and (2)  Non-profit organizations who are registered in the State who purchase one or more new qualifying electric bicycles, electric mopeds, or electric micro-mobility devices. [(h)] (j)  In administering the electric [bicycle and electric moped] mobility device rebate program, the department of transportation shall provide [rebates] an assistance rebate in addition to the rebate in subsection (b).  The additional assistance rebate shall be $750 or the full retail amount, whichever amount is lower, to persons [eighteen] fifteen years or older who: (1)  Are eligible for: (A)  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; (B)  The free and reduced price lunch program; (C)  Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended; or (D)  Similar low-income assistance programs identified by the department of transportation; (2)  Do not own a registered motor vehicle with four or more wheels, as demonstrated by an affidavit signed by the applicant at the time of sale of the new electric bicycle [or], electric moped, adaptive electric bicycle, or electric micro-mobility device, which may be audited by the department of transportation; or (3)  Are enrolled in school, community college, or university.

The third-party administrator shall not be deemed to be a "governmental body" as defined in section 103D-104; provided that all moneys transferred to the third-party administrator shall have been appropriated by the legislature or shall be from moneys provided by the federal government or private funding sources. The third-party administrator shall not expend more than ten per cent of the amounts appropriated for the rebate program, or any other reasonable percentage determined by the department of transportation, for administration, promotion, and reporting of the electric [bicycle and electric moped] mobility device rebate program.
