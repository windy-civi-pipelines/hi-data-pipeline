BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the ability to store locally produced clean energy supports resilience, reliability, and affordability of the State's energy supply. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to support the continued development and storage of resilient, sustainable, and locally produced clean energy in the State and to make the State competitive for clean energy storage federal grants by: (1)  Amending the Hawaii renewable hydrogen program and hydrogen investment capital special fund to encompass a broader focus on long duration clean energy storage; and (2)  Transferring responsibility for the program to the Hawaii state energy office. SECTION 2.  Chapter 196, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part V to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§196-     Long duration clean energy storage investment capital special fund.  (a)  There shall be established the long duration clean energy storage investment capital special fund, into which shall be deposited: (1)  Appropriations made by the legislature to the fund; (2)  All contributions from public or private partners; (3)  All interest earned on or accrued to moneys deposited in the special fund; and (4)  Any other moneys made available to the special fund from other sources.
