SR120 SD1 THE SENATE S.R. NO. 120 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII SENATE RESOLUTION requesting the office of the state fire marshal to convene a vegetation management working group to study, evaluate, and make recommendations for REGULATIONS that define the respective obligations of property owners, lessees, licensees, permittees, and holders of easements for access, utility, or other purposes, for vegetation management on public and private property TO MITIGATE wildfire RISK, and make recommendations that define a line clearance tree trimmer and establish minimum safety standards, training, and qualifications for individuals performing line clearance tree trimming at or near electric utility facilities. WHEREAS, on August 8, 2023, catastrophic wildfires swept through various communities on the island of Maui; and WHEREAS, the wildfires significantly impacted human life and the health, community housing, education, economy, and environment of Maui residents; and WHEREAS, the presence of grass, trees, and other vegetation adjacent to or under electric utility lines is a significant fire risk; and WHEREAS, in response to the wildfires, in 2023 the House of Representatives established six interim working groups, including the Wildfire Prevention Working Group, which were charged with evaluating specific topics related to the Lahaina wildfire and making recommendations for specific legislative action; and WHEREAS, the Wildfire Prevention Working Group found that people are the primary drivers of wildfires in Hawaii, as ninety-nine percent of wildfires are caused by human ignitions; and WHEREAS, the Wildfire Prevention Working Group also found that guinea grass, fountain grass, molasses grass, and buffelgrass can form continuous fuel beds, ignite easily, attain extremely high fine fuel loads, and grow back more vigorously in the post-fire environment than the majority of native vegetation; and WHEREAS, utility companies have miles of utility lines installed throughout the State on public and private lands, including within the public rights of way and mountainous areas of the State; and WHEREAS, a significant portion of these public lands is covered with unmanaged grasses, trees, and other vegetation that may pose a significant wildfire risk; and WHEREAS, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that the tree industry average annual fatal-incident rate is thirty times greater than the all-industry average annual fatal‑incident rate; and WHEREAS, the Legislature recognizes that other state jurisdictions have recognized the additional hazard presented to individuals performing line clearance tree trimming at or near electric utility facilities and have adopted state law requiring minimum safety standards, training, and qualifications for individuals performing such work; and WHEREAS, additional study into appropriate vegetation management will enable the State to develop appropriate policies, regulations, and guidance for the parties responsible for the management of vegetation on public and private lands to mitigate wildfire risk and establish minimum safety standards, training, and qualifications for individuals performing line clearance tree trimming at or near electric utility facilities; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, that the Office of the State Fire Marshal is requested to convene a Vegetation Management Working Group (Working Group) to study, evaluate, and make recommendations for regulations that define the respective obligations of property owners, lessees, licensees, permittees, and holders of easements for access, utility, or other purposes, for vegetation management on public and private property to mitigate wildfire risk, and make recommendations that define a line clearance tree trimmer and establish minimum safety standards, training, and qualifications for individuals performing line clearance tree trimming at or near electric utility facilities; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that in its review of vegetation management, the Working Group is requested to consider the following: (1)  Wildfire risk mitigation actions being proposed as part of the Hawaiian Electric Company's Climate Adaptation Transmission and Distribution and Resilience Program and Wildfire Safety Strategy filed with the Public Utilities Commission as Docket No. 2022-0135 and Docket No. 2025-0156, respectively; and (2)  The hazard mitigation plans of electric utilities, including the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative, filed with the Public Utilities Commission as part of a non‑docketed proceeding under Case No. 2023-04661 in response to Public Utilities Commission Order No. 40396;
