SECTION 2.  Definitions.  As used in this Act: "Blockchain technology" means a decentralized digital ledger technology that securely records and verifies transactions. "Digitization" means the conversion of physical land records into electronic formats for storage and access. "Land registry system" means the system used for recording, maintaining, and accessing land ownership, transactions, and other property-related information. SECTION 3.  Consolidation of land registry systems.  (a)  The land court system and regular system shall be consolidated into a single, unified land registry system to streamline operations and enhance user experience.

(c)  The unified land registry system shall retain features of both systems, including title certification and public recording, to preserve existing legal protections. SECTION 4.  Digitization of land records.  (a) The department of land and natural resources shall oversee the digitization of all land records, including historical and current documents, into a centralized, searchable online database. (b)  The database shall: (1)  Be accessible to the public, subject to privacy and security measures; (2)  Provide user-friendly search functions, including searches by parcel number, owner name, and transaction history; and (3)  Include a secure portal for submitting and accessing records electronically.
