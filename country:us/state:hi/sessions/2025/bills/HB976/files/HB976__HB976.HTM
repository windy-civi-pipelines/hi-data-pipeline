HB976 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 976 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to renewable fuel. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii is at a critical crossroad in the State's ongoing quest to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  In 2021, Hawaii became the first state in the nation to declare a climate emergency and is now poised to lead by example in mitigating the impacts of climate change through adaptive and preemptive actions to transition toward a multi-sector decarbonized economy.  This is aligned with the ambitious Hawaii clean energy initiative, which seeks to achieve the nation's first-ever one hundred per cent renewable portfolio standards by the year 2045.  The legislature acknowledged the necessity to analyze pathways and develop recommendations to achieve economy-wide decarbonization goals by adopting Act 238, Sessions Laws of Hawaii 2022. The legislature additionally finds that the State has made progress in reducing greenhouse gas pathways by adopting alternatives to fossil fuel for electrical power generation and introducing alternatives for ground transportation, including the use of electric vehicles.  Additionally, sustainable aviation fuel for air transportation is another pathway that deserves more robust exploration.  Hawaii has the opportunity to accelerate its progress toward achieving net-zero or net-negative targets as quickly as practicable, but no later than 2045.  As an island state heavily reliant on air transportation, it is important to provide incentives within the airline industry to encourage practices that lower carbon footprints. The legislature acknowledges that total jet fuel consumption in Hawaii is seventeen million barrels (seven hundred fourteen million gallons) per year between civilian and military consumption.  To provide greater energy security for the State, the legislature finds that instead of investing in imported crude oil or refined petroleum products and perpetuating the State's dependence on fossil fuels, local sustainable fuel production will allow investment in the local economy and support job creation. The legislature further acknowledges that while sustainable aviation fuel offers multiple benefits, the cost of its production is several times that of conventional fuels. Thus, creating a regulatory framework to support local sustainable aviation fuel production is critical.  As with other states, Hawaii must look at policies that will work in tandem with federal policies to make sustainable aviation fuel production sustainable within the State. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to advance Hawaii's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by: (1)  Establishing the sustainable aviation fuel import tax credit; (2)  Increasing the renewable fuels production tax credit amount; (3)  Repealing the: (A)  Cap amount of claimable renewable fuels production tax credit; (B)  Requirement that the tax credit be claimed for fuels with lifecycle emissions below fossil fuels; and (C)  Prohibition on claiming other tax credits for the cost incurred to produce renewable fuels; (4)  Specifying that the renewable fuels production tax credit can only be claimed for fuels that meet the certain thresholds; (5)  Adding an additional renewable fuels production tax credit value; (6)  Clarifying that a taxpayer who previously claimed a renewable fuels production tax credit may claim another one for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024; (7)  Clarifying and expanding required information in the certified statement for the renewable fuels production tax credit; and (8)  Repealing the requirement that the Hawaii state energy office provide the taxpayer with a determination of whether the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions for each type of qualified fuel produced is lower than that of fossil fuels. SECTION 2.  Chapter 235, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part VI to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§235-     Sustainable aviation fuel import tax credit.  (a)  There shall be allowed to each taxpayer subject to the taxes imposed by this chapter a sustainable aviation fuel income tax credit that shall be deducted from the taxpayer's net income tax liability, if any, imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in which the credit is properly claimed. For each taxpayer importing sustainable aviation fuel into the State, the amount of the credit shall be $1 per gallon of sustainable aviation fuel sold for distribution in the State; provided that the tax credit shall only be claimed for sustainable aviation fuel that meets the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction threshold. (b)  In the case of a partnership, S corporation, estate, or trust, distribution and share of the renewable fuels production tax credit shall be determined pursuant to section 704(b) (with respect to a partner's distributive share) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  For a fiscal year taxpayer, the taxpayer shall report the credit in the taxable year in which the calendar year end is included. (c)  No later than thirty days following the close of the calendar year, every taxpayer claiming a credit under this section shall complete and file an independent, third-party certified statement, at the taxpayer's sole expense, with and in the form prescribed by the Hawaii state energy office, providing the following information: (1)  The type and quantity of sustainable aviation fuel imported and sold during the previous calendar year; (2)  The feedstock used to produce the imported sustainable aviation fuel; (3)  The proposed total amount of credit to which the taxpayer is entitled for each calendar year and the cumulative amount of the tax credit the taxpayer received the previous calendar year; (4)  The number of full-time and part-time employees of the facility and those employees' states of residency, totaled per state; (5)  The number and location of all renewable fuel facilities within and outside the State; (6)  The lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per million British thermal units for each type of qualified fuel imported; and (7)  The lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reported to the United States Department of the Treasury if different than the emissions reported under paragraph (6). (d)  Within thirty calendar days after the due date of the statement required under subsection (c), the Hawaii state energy office shall: (1)  Acknowledge, in writing, receipt of the statement; and (2)  Issue a certificate to the taxpayer reporting the: (A)  Amount of sustainable aviation fuel imported and sold; (B)  Amount of credit that the taxpayer is entitled to claim for the previous calendar year, inclusive of any carryover amount; (C)  Amount of credit that the taxpayer is entitled to claim for any subsequent calendar year; and (D)  Cumulative amount of the tax credit during the previous calendar year. (e)  The taxpayer shall file the certificate issued under subsection (d)(2) with the taxpayer's tax return with the department of taxation.  The director of taxation may audit and adjust the certification to conform to the facts. (f)  The total amount of tax credits allowed under this section for all eligible taxpayers shall not exceed: (1)  $5,000,000 for calendar year 2025; (2)  $10,000,000 for calendar year 2026; (3)  $20,000,000 for calendar year 2027; (4)  $30,000,000 for calendar year 2028; and (5)  $50,000,000 for calendar years 2029 to 2036. In the event that the credit claims under this section exceed the total credits allowed for all eligible taxpayers in any given calendar year, the total credits allowed shall be allocated proportionally to each eligible taxpayer in proportion to the amount of such taxpayer's credits under this section for the calendar year. To the extent that the limitations of this subsection reduce the amount of a taxpayer's credit, the amount of the reduction shall be available to the taxpayer to be used as a credit in the next subsequent calendar year but shall not be carried over for any calendar year thereafter; provided that the carryover credit shall subject to the limitations of this subsection. (g)  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the information collected and compiled by the Hawaii state energy office under subsections (c) and (d) shall be available for public inspection and dissemination pursuant to chapter 92F. (h)  If the credit under this section exceeds the taxpayer's net income tax liability, the excess of the credit over liability may be used as a credit against the taxpayer's net income tax liability in subsequent years until exhausted, unless otherwise elected by the taxpayer pursuant to subsection (i) or (j).  All claims for a credit under this section shall be properly filed on or before the end of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the credit may be claimed.  Failure to comply with the foregoing provision or to provide the certified statement required under subsection (c) shall constitute a waiver of the right to claim the credit. (i)  A taxpayer may elect to reduce the eligible credit amount by thirty per cent and if this reduced amount exceeds the amount of income tax payment due from the taxpayer, the excess of the credit amount over payments due shall be refunded to the taxpayer; provided that tax credit amounts properly claimed by a taxpayer who has no income tax liability shall be paid to the taxpayer; provided further that no refund on account of the tax credit allowed by this section shall be made for amounts less than $1.

(d) Within thirty calendar days after the due date of the statement required under subsection (c), the Hawaii state energy office shall: (1)  Acknowledge, in writing, receipt of the statement; and (2)  Issue a certificate to the taxpayer reporting the amount of renewable fuels produced and sold, the amount of credit that the taxpayer is entitled to claim for the previous calendar year, and the cumulative amount of the tax credit during the credit period[; and (3)  Provide the taxpayer with a determination of whether the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions for each type of qualified fuel produced is lower than that of fossil fuels]." 3. By amending subsection (f) to read: "(f)  The total amount of tax credits allowed under this section for all eligible taxpayers in any calendar year shall not exceed [$20,000,000 for all eligible taxpayers in any calendar year.]: (1)  $40,000,000 for calendar year 2025; (2)  $50,000,000 for calendar year 2026; (3)  $60,000,000 for calendar year 2027; (4)  $70,000,000 for calendar year 2028; and (5)  $80,000,000 for calendar year 2029 and thereafter. In the event that the credit claims under this section exceed [$20,000,000] the total amount allowed for all eligible taxpayers in any given calendar year, the [$20,000,000] total amount allowed shall be [divided between all] allocated proportionally to eligible taxpayers [for that year] in proportion to the total amount of renewable fuels [produced by all eligible taxpayers.  Upon reaching $20,000,000 in the aggregate, the Hawaii state energy office shall immediately discontinue issuing certificates and notify the department of taxation.  In no instance shall the total dollar amount of certificates issued exceed $20,000,000 per calendar year.] production tax credits under this section for the calendar year.  No taxpayer shall be eligible for more than seventy-five per cent of the total amount allowed in any year.  To the extent that the limitations of this subsection reduce the amount of a taxpayer's credit, the amount of the reduction shall be available to the taxpayer to be used as a credit in the subsequent calendar year; provided that the credit shall not be carried over for any calendar year thereafter; provided further that the carryover credit shall be subject to the limitations of this subsection." 4. By amending subsection (o) to read: "(o)  As used in this section: "Credit period" means a maximum period of ten consecutive years, beginning from the first taxable year in which a taxpayer begins renewable fuels production at a level of at least two billion five-hundred million British thermal units of renewable fuels per calendar year.
