C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO AGRICULTURAL LOANS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that Hawaii agricultural
2 producers face critical barriers in accessing capital necessary
3 to cover rising land and water costs, labor shortages, and
4 infrastructure needs. Modifications to the state agricultural
5 loan program are needed to address these challenges and
6 encourage farmers and ranchers to expand their current
7 operations. A diverse agricultural sector that includes small
8 and mid-sized farms is essential to Hawaii's food security,
9 economic resilience, and self-sufficiency. Modifications to the
10 state agricultural loan program should ensure equitable access
11 to capital for farmers of all scales, with a focus on enabling
12 sustainable, community-based, and diversified production.
13 The purpose of this Act is to:
14 (1) Lower and fix the state agricultural loan program's
15 interest rates, increase loan limits, and reduce the
16 required number of credit denials;
2025-3342 HB984 CDl HMSO

C.D. 1
1 (2) Establish a program for a secured line of credit and
2 create a new loan initiative to encourage larger scale
3 agriculture for import replacement and crops grown for
4 farm to state programs; and
5 (3) Include food hubs as an eligible entity for class E
6 loans.
7 SECTION 2. Section 155-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
8 amended by adding two new definitions to be appropriately
9 inserted and to read as follows:
10 ""Import replacement crops” means crops grown on a
11 large-scale basis in the State with the specific intent to
12 replace crops imported into the State.
13 "Line of credit" means a secured revolving loan with a
14 preset credit limit."
15 SECTION 3. Section 155-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
16 amended to read as follows:
17 "§155-3 Restriction. Loans authorized by this chapter
18 shall require [two credit denials,—ex-eept for class "F" loans
19 for new farmer and farm innovati-en programs,—which shall
20 require] one credit denial. This requirement shall be waived
21 for new farmer loans for $100,000 or less for farm trainees and

12 amount disbursed to the borrower. The interest rate on loans of
13 class "A", "B", "C", "E", [end] "G", and "J” shall be at a rate

STATE OF HAWAII i - " S □ 1
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO AGRICULTURAL LOANS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that Hawaii agricultural
2 producers face critical barriers in accessing capital necessary
3 to cover rising land and water costs, labor shortages, and
4 infrastructure needs. Modifications to the state agricultural
5 loan program are needed to address these challenges and
6 encourage farmers and ranchers to expand their current
7 operations. A diverse agricultural sector that includes small
8 and mid-sized farms is essential to Hawaii's food security,
9 economic resilience, and self-sufficiency. Modifications to the
10 state agricultural loan program should ensure equitable access
11 to capital for farmers of all scales, with a focus on enabling
12 sustainable, community-based, and diversified production.
13 The purpose of this Act is to:
14 (1) Lower and fix the state agricultural loan program's
15 interest rates, increase loan limits, and reduce the
16 required number of credit denials;

C.D. 1
1 (2) Establish a program for a secured line of credit and
2 create a new loan initiative to encourage larger scale
3 agriculture for import replacement and crops grown for
4 farm to state programs; and
5 (3) Include food hubs as an eligible entity for class E
6 loans.
7 SECTION 2. Section 155-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
8 amended by adding two new definitions to be appropriately
9 inserted and to read as follows:
10 ""Import replacement crops” means crops grown on a
11 large-scale basis in the State with the specific intent to
12 replace crops imported into the State.
13 "Line of credit" means a secured revolving loan with a
14 preset credit limit."
15 SECTION 3. Section 155-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
16 amended to read as follows:
17 "§155-3 Restriction. Loans authorized by this chapter
18 shall require [two credit denials,—ex-eept for class "F" loans
19 for new farmer and farm innovati-en programs,—which shall
20 require] one credit denial. This requirement shall be waived
21 for new farmer loans for $100,000 or less for farm trainees and

6 (2) Members of the farm credit system; or
7 (3) The United States Department of Agriculture."
8 SECTION 4. Section 155-8, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
9 amended by amending subsection (c) to read as follows:
10 "(c) Loans made under this section shall bear simple
11 interest on the unpaid principal balance, charged on the actual
12 amount disbursed to the borrower. The interest rate on loans of
13 class "A", "B", "C", "E", [end] "G", and "J” shall be at a rate
