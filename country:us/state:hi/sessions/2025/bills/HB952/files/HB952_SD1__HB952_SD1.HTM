Section 1:
HB952 SD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 952 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII S.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO PARKINSON'S DISEASE RESEARCH. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Parkinson's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that gradually worsens over time. Parkinson's disease occurs when the brain cells that produce dopamine, a neurotransmitter that coordinates movement, become slow, stop working correctly, or die.  There is no known treatment to stop or reverse the progression of Parkinson's disease, nor is there a cure.  The legislature also finds that there are approximately one million people in the United States living with Parkinson's disease, which is estimated to rise to 1,600,000 by 2037.  At least one hundred ten thousand veterans in the United States, and between four and seven thousand people in the State, live with Parkinson's disease. The legislature further finds that the estimated annual national economic burden to society from Parkinson's disease is $52,000,000,000 each year in medical and non-medical expenses.  That number is expected to exceed $79,000,000,000 by 2037.  The importance of collecting critical research data is the first step to better understand who develops Parkinson's disease and why. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to expand the State's understanding of Parkinson's disease to ultimately improve the lives of those affected, determine incidence and prevalence of Parkinson's disease more accurately by state, and improve understanding of the link between Parkinson's disease and military service, since a larger portion of the veteran community has Parkinson's disease as compared to the general population, by establishing a Parkinson's disease research collection database within the state health planning and development agency. SECTION 2. Chapter 321, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part    . parkinson's disease research §321-A Definitions.  As used in this part: "Agency" means the state health planning and development agency. "Administrator" means the administrator of the state health planning and development agency. "Parkinsonisms" means related conditions that cause a combination of the movement abnormalities seen in Parkinson's disease, such as tremor at rest, slow movement, muscle rigidity, impaired speech or muscle stiffness that often overlap with and can evolve from what appears to be Parkinson's disease, such as multiple system atrophy, dementia with Lewy bodies, corticobasal degeneration, and progressive supranuclear palsy. "Parkinson's database" means the Parkinson's disease research collection database established pursuant to section 321-B. "Parkinson's disease" means a chronic and progressive neurologic disorder resulting from deficiency of the neurotransmitter dopamine as the consequence of specific degenerative changes in the area of the brain called the basal ganglia characterized by tremor at rest, slow movements, muscle rigidity, stooped posture, and unsteady or shuffling gait.

(d) The agency may: (1)  Enter into contracts, grants, or other agreements necessary for the administration of the Parkinson's database; (2)  Create, review, and revise a list of data points required as part of mandated Parkinson's disease reporting under this section; provided that the list shall include necessary triggering diagnostic conditions, consistent with the latest international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems, and resulting case data including diagnosis, treatment, and survival; (3)  Implement and administer this part through a bulletin or similar instruction to providers, which shall be exempt from the rulemaking process requirements of chapter 91; (4)  Enter into data sharing contracts with data reporting entities and their associated electronic medical record systems vendors to securely and confidentially receive information related to Parkinson's disease testing, diagnosis, and treatment; and (5)  Enter into agreements to furnish data collected in the Parkinson's database to other states' Parkinson's disease registries, federal Parkinson's disease control agencies, local health officers, or health researchers for the study of Parkinson's disease; provided that, before confidential information is disclosed, the requesting entity shall agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality of the information, and in the case of health researchers, shall: (A)  Obtain approval of their governing committee or institutional review board for the protection of human subjects established in accordance with title 45 Code of Federal Regulations section 46.101 et seq.; and (B)  Provide documentation to the agency that demonstrates to the agency's satisfaction that the entity has established the procedures and ability to maintain the confidentiality of the information. (e) Any hospital, facility, physician, surgeon, physician assistant, advanced practice registered nurse, or other health care provider deemed necessary by the agency, diagnosing or providing primary clinical treatment for patients with Parkinson's disease or Parkinsonisms shall report each case of Parkinson's disease and Parkinsonisms to the agency in a format prescribed by the agency. (f) This section shall not preempt the authority of facilities or individuals providing diagnostic or treatment services to patients with Parkinson's disease to maintain its own facility-based Parkinson's database. §321-C Parkinson's disease research collection database advisory committee.  (a) The agency shall establish a Parkinson's disease research collection database advisory committee, which shall consist of an odd number of members, not less than nine, who shall be appointed by the administrator and include at least one of each of the following: (1)  General neurologist; (2)  Movement disorder specialist; (3) Primary care physician; (4)  Physician informaticist; (5)  Patient living with Parkinson's disease; (6)  Public health staff; (7)  Population health researcher familiar with registries; (8)  Parkinson's disease researcher; and (9)  Any other member the agency deems appropriate and necessary.
