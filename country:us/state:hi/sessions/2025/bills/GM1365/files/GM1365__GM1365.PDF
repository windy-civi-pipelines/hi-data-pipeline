C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO SMALL PURCHASES.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds, that escalating costs of
2 goods over the years, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic,
3 have created numerous difficulties regarding small purchase
4 procurement. The legislature further finds that the frequency
5 of earthquakes on Hawaii island, an indicator of a future
6 potentially devastating volcanic eruption that could impact
7 residential and commercial areas, as well as the devastation
8 from the tragic 2023 Maui wildfires, emphasize the inescapable
9 need to address issues with small purchase procurements to
10 facilitate more efficient disaster recovery efforts.
11 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
12 (1) Increase the minimum amount for purchases constituting
13 small purchase procurements that are subject to an
14 electronic system, from $25,000 to $50,000; and
15 (2) Require the state procurement office to submit a
16 report to the legislature on the efficacy of the
17 increased minimum small purchase procurement amounts.
