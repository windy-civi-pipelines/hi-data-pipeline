Section 1:
HB466 HD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 466 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO EVICTIONS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that nearly forty per cent of Hawaii households are renters.  Currently, renters can lose their housing through arbitrary non-renewals of their leases, even if they are tenants in good standing.  These arbitrary no-cause evictions disrupt the lives of tenants and contribute to financial insecurity and housing instability.  The fear of retaliatory no-cause evictions can also deter tenants from advocating for repairs and addressing habitability issues. The legislature further finds that preventing housing insecurity and displacement for local families requires that tenants be protected from arbitrary displacement. Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Prohibit landlords from terminating certain tenancies without cause; (2)  Establish criteria under which landlords can undertake a no-fault eviction; and (3)  Require landlords, when proceeding with a no-fault eviction, to offer relocation assistance to the tenant or waiver of the final month's rent. SECTION 2.  Chapter 521, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part    .  CAUSE FOR EVICTION; NO-FAULT EVICTIONS §521-A  Definitions.  As used in this part: "No-fault eviction" means an action for summary possession brought by a landlord that does not constitute cause under section 521-B(b). "Substantial violation" means any act or series of acts by the tenant or any guest of the tenant that, when considered together: (1)  Occurs on or near the premises and endangers persons or willfully and substantially endangers the property of the landlord, any co-tenant, or any person living on or near the premises; (2)  Occurs on or near the premises and constitutes a violent or drug-related felony; or (3)  Occurs on the tenant's premises or the common areas, hallway, grounds, parking lot, or other area located in the same building or complex in which the tenant's dwelling unit is located and constitutes a criminal act in violation of federal or state law or county ordinance that: (A)  Carries a potential sentence of imprisonment of one hundred eighty days or more; and (B)  Has been declared to be a public nuisance under state law or county ordinance. §521-B Termination of tenancy; cause for eviction. (a)  No landlord shall serve a notice to terminate tenancy or file an action for summary possession unless there is cause for the eviction. (b)  The following actions by a tenant shall constitute cause for eviction: (1)  Substantial violation; (2)  Material noncompliance with section 521-51; (3)  Nonpayment of rent, subject to section 521-68; (4)  Waste, failure to maintain, or unlawful use, subject to section 521-69; (5)  Whenever the term of the rental agreement expires, whether by passage of time, by mutual agreement, by the giving of notice as provided in section 521-71(a), (b), (c), or (d) or by the exercise by the landlord of a right to terminate given under this chapter, continued possession of the dwelling unit after the date of termination without the landlord's consent, subject to section 521-71(e); (6)  Breach of any rule authorized under section 521-52, subject to section 521-72; (7)  Continued possession after a legal sale pursuant to section 521-74(b)(6); (8)  Refusal or failure to surrender property that has been sold under a judgment or decree by the party or privies to the judgment or decree after the expiration of the time of redemption, when redemption is allowed by law, after the purchaser demands the property; (9)  Continued possession by an heir or a devisee of a premises sold and conveyed by a personal representative; (10)  Failure of a holdover vendee to comply with an agreement to purchase lands or structures on the premises; or (11)  Nuisance, negligent damage of the dwelling unit, or use of the dwelling unit for an illegal purpose or for purposes that are in violation of the rental agreement. §521-C  No fault eviction; demolition, conversion, or change of use.  In addition to the requirements for termination of a month-to-month tenancy pursuant to section 571-71(c), when a landlord contemplates voluntary demolition of the dwelling units, conversion to a condominium property regime under chapter 514B, or changing the use of the building to transient vacation rentals, the landlord may initiate a no-fault eviction of a tenant of the residential premises; provided that the landlord shall provide the tenant proper service of a written notice of the no-fault eviction.  The written notice shall include: (1)  The date by which the tenant shall vacate the dwelling unit, which shall be at least one hundred and twenty days in advance of the anticipated demolition, conversion, or changing of use; and (2)  A description and timeline of the anticipated demolition, conversion, or changing of use of the building and a material demonstration of the proposed date upon which the project will commence, such as a copy of a building permit or application for a permit or license to operate a transient vacation rental, where applicable. §521-D  No fault eviction; substantial repairs, alterations, or renovations.

(b)  A landlord shall not initiate a no-fault eviction of a tenant pursuant to subsection (a) if the substantial repairs, alterations, or renovations that are the alleged basis of the no-fault eviction are: (1)  Required for the landlord to satisfy all required remedial action concerning a breach of the warranty of habitability; or (2)  Initiated by the landlord in retaliation against the tenant in violation of section 521-74(a). §521-E  No-fault eviction; landlord or immediate family; assuming occupancy.  (a)  When a landlord plans to recover possession of a dwelling unit for immediate use as the landlord's own abode or that of the landlord's immediate family, the landlord may initiate a no-fault eviction; provided that: (1)  Except as provided in subsection (c), the landlord or the landlord's immediate family shall move into the dwelling unit within three months after the tenant vacates the dwelling unit; (2)  Except as provided in subsection (b), the landlord shall provide the tenant proper service of a written notice of the no-fault eviction and allow the tenant at least sixty days after receiving the written notice to vacate the dwelling unit, during which time the tenant may remain in possession of the dwelling unit under the same terms of the tenant's existing rental agreement; (3)  In the case of a multi-family unit building, no substantially equivalent dwelling unit is vacant and available to house the landlord or the landlord's immediate family in the same building; and (4)  The landlord shall not list the dwelling unit as a transient vacation rental for at least sixty days after the date the tenant is required to vacate.
