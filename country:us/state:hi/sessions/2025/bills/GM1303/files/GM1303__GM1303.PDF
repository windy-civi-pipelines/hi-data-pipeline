C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO THE UNIVERSAL SERVICE PROGRAM.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the public utilities
2 commission provides critical services that ensure access to a
3 basic set of essential telecommunications services for
4 individuals who are blind or visually impaired.
5 In 1995, the legislature established the universal service
6 program, the purpose of which, in relevant part, is to help
7 customers with disabilities access and maintain a basic set of
8 essential telecommunications services as determined by the
9 commission. By law, all telecommunications carriers are
10 required to contribute to this program. However, the universal
11 service program is currently inactive with no funds available in
12 the universal service fund. Moreover, the public utilities
13 commission lacks clear legislative authority to develop a
14 program addressing print disability through the universal
15 service fund and does not have budget authorization to expend
16 funds for this purpose.

16 disabilities, in obtaining and maintaining access to a
17 basic set of essential telecommunications services as
18 determined by the commission. The commission may
