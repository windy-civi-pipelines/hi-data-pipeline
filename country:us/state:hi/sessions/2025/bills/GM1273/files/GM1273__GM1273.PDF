STATE OF HAWAII S.D. 2
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO CHILD PERFORMERS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the Coogan Law, also
2 known as the California Child Actor's Bill, was first passed in
3 California in 1939 to protect child actors from exploitation in
4 the entertainment industry. The law was named after actor
5 Jackie Coogan, who became one of the highest-paid child stars of
6 his time, only to have his earnings mismanaged by his parents,
7 leaving him with little financial security when he reached
8 adulthood. The Coogan Law has had a lasting impact in
9 California by securing financial protection for child actors,
10 ensuring that they can enjoy the benefits of their hard work
11 once they become adults, and promoting greater responsibility in
12 the entertainment industry.
13 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to protect the
14 safety, morals, health, and well-being of child performers who
15 work or reside in the State by requiring that a portion of the
16 child performer's earnings be kept in trust for the benefit of
17 the child performer until the child reaches the age of majority.

6 guardian of a minor in theatrical employment shall establish a
