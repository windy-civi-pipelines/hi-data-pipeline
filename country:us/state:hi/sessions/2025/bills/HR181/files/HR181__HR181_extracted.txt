HR181 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.R. NO. 181 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII HOUSE RESOLUTION requesting the governor, state agencies, and other relevant stakeholders to accelerate hawaii's clean energy TRANSITION and take immediate, decisive action to reduce and eliminate dependence on imported fossil fuels to improve energy security and protect consumers from rising energy costs. WHEREAS, Hawaii has the highest electricity rates in the United States due largely to a reliance on imported fossil fuels, with residents paying an average of 42.39 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in 2023 compared to the national average of 16 cents per kWh, leading to monthly electricity bills that are 63.1 percent higher than the national average; and WHEREAS, low-income households in the State face disproportionately high energy burdens, with families that live below the federal poverty level spending nearly twenty percent of their income on electricity costs compared to the national average of 2.3 percent; and WHEREAS, Hawaii remains the most fossil-fuel dependent state in the nation; the State's reliance on imported fossil fuels for the majority of its energy needs makes it highly vulnerable to global fuel price volatility, supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical instability; and WHEREAS, recent global economic pressures, United States trade tariffs, and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine have exacerbated fossil fuel price volatility, directly impacting consumers in the State through increased transportation and electricity costs; and WHEREAS, the volatility of fossil fuel prices is a primary driver of high electricity rates in the State, forcing families to choose between purchasing essential needs and paying utility bills, while also raising operational expenses for local businesses and increasing the costs of goods and services statewide; and WHEREAS, accelerating the State's transition to solar, wind, geothermal, and energy storage and efficiency solutions will provide long-term cost savings for consumers, reduce economic dependence on volatile foreign fossil fuel markets, and improve energy affordability and security; and WHEREAS, investments in renewable energy infrastructure will not only stabilize consumer energy costs but also create high-quality local jobs, foster technological innovation, and stimulate economic growth within Hawaii's local economy; and WHEREAS, the State recognizes the constitutional rights of its people to a clean and healthful environment, as stated in article XI, section 9 of the Hawaii State Constitution, including the right to a life-sustaining climate system, and has public trust obligations under article XI, section 1 of the Hawaii State Constitution to conserve and protect Hawaii's natural beauty and resources, including air and energy resources, for present and future generations; and WHEREAS, Executive Order No. 25-01, issued by Governor Josh Green, M.D., emphasizes the urgent need to accelerate the transition to achieve one hundred percent renewable energy production and reduce fossil fuel dependency through strategic investments and policy measures; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, that the Governor, state agencies, and other relevant stakeholders are requested to accelerate Hawaii's clean energy transition and take immediate, decisive action to reduce and eliminate dependence on imported fossil fuels to improve energy security and protect consumers from rising energy costs; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the immediate, decisive actions are requested to ensure equitable access to renewable energy for all communities in the State, particularly those with historically underserved populations that are disproportionately burdened by high energy costs; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Governor; Director of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism; Chief Energy Officer of the Hawaii State Energy Office; Chairperson of the Public Utilities Commission; and the chief executive officer of each public utility operating in the State.
