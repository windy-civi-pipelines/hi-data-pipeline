THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO CORRECTIONS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that experts have long
2 documented the detrimental effects of restrictive housing on
3 individuals. Spending time in restrictive housing has been
4 found to increase the risk of premature death, even after
5 release from incarceration. Restrictive housing is a severe
6 form of punishment that is closely associated with long-lasting
7 psychological harm and poor post-release outcomes. The official
8 purposes of restrictive housing are typically divided into
9 punishment and correctional facility management. When used as
10 punishment by facility authorities, sometimes called
11 "disciplinary custody" or "disciplinary segregation",
12 restrictive housing serves as a response to misconduct charges
13 such as fighting or drug use. When used for correctional
14 facility management, often called "administrative custody" or
15 "administrative segregation", restrictive housing serves to
16 separate inmates deemed to pose a threat to staff or other
17 inmates, or as protective custody for inmates who seem or are

C.D. 1
1 determined to be unsafe in the general prison population.
2 Although the purposes of restrictive housing vary, correctional
3 facility conditions and restrictions are often similar whether
4 an incarcerated person is in disciplinary or administrative
5 custody.
6 The legislature also finds that an overwhelming body of
7 evidence shows that restrictive housing, which deprives inmates
8 of meaningful human contact, including phone privileges that
9 allow them to speak with loved ones, creates permanent
10 psychological, neurological, and physical damage. Studies show
11 that the detrimental effects of restrictive housing far exceed
12 the immediate psychological consequences identified by previous
13 research, such as anxiety, depression, and hallucinations.
14 Unfortunately, these detrimental effects do not disappear once
15 an inmate is released from restrictive housing. Even after
16 release back into a community setting, a former inmate faces an
17 elevated risk of suicide, drug overdose, heart attack, and
18 stroke.
19 The legislature recognizes that as of 2021, legislation to
20 ban or limit the use of restrictive housing in prison has been
21 introduced in thirty-two states and the United States Congress.

C.D. 1
1 Further, twenty-four states have enacted statutes that limit or
2 prohibit restrictive housing while other states have limited its
3 use through administrative code, policy, or court rules. Many
4 of these new laws, codes, policies, or court rules represent
5 significant reforms to existing practices and thus have the
6 potential to facilitate more humane and effective practices in
7 prisons and jails.
8 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
9 (1) Beginning July 1, 2026, restrict the use of
10 restrictive housing in state-operated and
11 state-contracted correctional facilities, with certain
12 specified exceptions;
13 (2) Establish a restrictive housing legislative working
14 group by August 1, 2025, to develop and recommend more
15 comprehensive laws, policies, and procedures regarding
16 restrictive housing for members of vulnerable
17 populations by January 8, 2027;
18 (3) Require the Hawaii correctional system oversight
19 commission to review restrictive housing placements on
20 an annual basis;

C.D. 1
1 (4) Authorize the department of corrections and
2 rehabilitation, by December 1, 2027, to implement, if
3 practicable, policies and procedures recommended by
4 the restrictive housing working group related to
5 committed persons who are members of certain
6 vulnerable populations and placed in restrictive
7 housing and develop transition and service plans for
8 these committed persons in restrictive housing; and
9 (5) Require interim and final reports to the legislature
10 and Hawaii correctional system oversight commission.
11 SECTION 2. Chapter 353, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
12 amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated
13 and to read as follows:
14 '’§3532^ Restrictive housing; restrictions on use;
15 policies and procedures. (a) Beginning July 1, 2026, except as
16 otherwise provided in subsection (d), the use of restrictive

6 bear the burden of establishing the foregoing by clear

9 confinement shall receive an initial medical and

10 A committed person placed in protective custody
11 shall be provided opportunities for activities,
12 movement, and social interaction, in a manner

17 population;
