THIRTY-THIRD LEGISUKTURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO THE HAWAII NATIONAL GUARD.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that section 121-12 (a),
2 Hawaii Revised Statutes, currently mandates that the Hawaii army
3 national guard and air national guard each be headed by an
4 assistant adjutant general, with the rank capped at brigadier
5 general. While most states' national guard components are
6 federally authorized to be headed by officers with a maximum
7 rank of brigadier general, the Department of the Air Force has
8 authorized the Hawaii air national guard to be led by an officer
9 with the rank of major general, reflecting the organization's
10 size and complexity. Additionally, the chief of staff position
11 for the Hawaii air national guard is federally authorized at the
12 grade of major general.
13 Accordingly, the purposes of this Act are to:
14 (1) Allow the head of the Hawaii air national guard to
15 hold the rank authorized by the Department of the Air
16 Force, which is currently major general;

1 (2) Provide the adjutant general with the flexibility to
2 assign either the chief of staff or the assistant
3 adjutant general to lead the Hawaii air national
4 guard; and
5 (3) Authorize the pay and allowances for the chief of
6 staff of the Hawaii air national guard to be
7 determined according to the pay tables of the regular
8 air force of the United States.
9 SECTION 2. Section 121-12, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
10 amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:
11 "(a) The headquarters staff of the national guard shall be
12 composed of the army national guard component, which shall
13 include a selective service section, and the air national guard
14 component. The headquarters shall be staffed by [ouoh] the
15 officers, warrant officers2_ and enlisted personnel, in the
16 grades and branches of service as may be authorized by the
17 secretaries of the army and the air force. The army division
18 [and the Qir--divisien] shall [eeeh] be headed by an assistant
19 adjutant general [7—who shall,—while—heidiftg—the——have a
20 grade -no higher than brigadier--goncra-l] . The air division shall
21 be headed by a chief of staff or an assistant adjutant general,

1 as determined by the adjutant general. The assistant adjutants
2 general[t] or chief of staff, when in the full-time employment
3 of the department of defense, may receive the pay and allowance
4 of their grade as fixed by the tables of the regular army or air
5 force of the United States."
6 SECTION 3. Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed
7 and stricken. New statutory material is underscored.
8 SECTION 4. This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
