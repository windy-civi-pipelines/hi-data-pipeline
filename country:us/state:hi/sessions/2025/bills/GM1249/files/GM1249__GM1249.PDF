A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO COVERED OFFENDER REGISTRATION.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that sex offenders
2 present an extreme threat to public safety due to high rates of
3 sexual recidivism. To mitigate this threat, Hawaii established
4 covered offender registration laws to require the public release
5 of relevant information concerning the presence of convicted sex
6 offenders in the community.
7 The legislature further finds that there are certain gaps
8 under the current registration laws for sexual offenses,
9 including offenses committed against minors. For example, the
10 public disclosure of registration information is not required
11 for an offender who, while acting in a professional capacity,
12 commits the offense of sexual assault in the fourth degree
13 against a minor who is at least sixteen years of age. This
14 omission would allow these sex offenders, who abused their
15 position of trust, power, authority, or supervision to engage in
16 sexual contact with a minor, to evade public detection and
17 continue to prey upon children in the community.

1 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to amend the
2 covered offender registration laws to:
3 (1) Include offenders who commit the offense of:
4 (A) Sexual assault in the fourth degree by exposing
5 the offender's genitals to another person under
6 circumstances in which the offender's conduct is
7 likely to alarm the other person or put the other
8 person in fear of bodily injury;
9 (B) Sexual assault in the fourth degree against a
10 minor who is at least sixteen years old while the
11 offender is acting in a professional capacity;
12 (C) Incest;
13 (D) Sexual assault of an animal; or
14 (E) Use a computer in the commission of a separate
15 crime, wherein the separate crime is a covered
16 offense subject to covered offender registration
17 laws;
18 (2) Require public disclosure for covered offenses that
19 are committed against minors, regardless of whether
20 the conviction was for a first-time misdemeanor
21 offense;
