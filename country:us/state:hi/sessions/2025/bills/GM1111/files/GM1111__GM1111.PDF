3 "(b) The attorney general shall select and enforce systems
4 of identification, including fingerprinting, of: all adults

10 years of age or older who come within section 571-11(1) and who

12 by an adult, would be a felony, a misdemeanor, or a petty
13 misdemeanor. The attorney general shall provide for the

3 either, upon court order or when: the child attains the age of

5 for committing the act for which the fingerprints were taken; or
6 the child is not informally adjusted under section 571-31.4 and
7 a petition is not filed within one year from the date the child
8 is taken into custody. The court shall notify the attorney

14 conviction of a person to whom a penal summons complaint or a
15 citation has been issued for a criminal offense, or upon the
16 granting of a deferred acceptance of a guilty or nolo contendere
17 plea or a conditional discharge to such person, the court shall
18 order the person to report, within seven days, to the
