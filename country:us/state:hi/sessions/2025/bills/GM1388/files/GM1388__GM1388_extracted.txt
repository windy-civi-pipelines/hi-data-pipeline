STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO FALL PREVENTION.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that unintentional falls
2 among seniors age sixty-five years and older in Hawaii are the
3 leading cause of fatal injuries (an average of forty-nine per
4 cent) and injury-related emergency room visits (an average of
5 sixty-one per cent). On average, one hundred and fourteen
6 seniors die, ten thousand are treated in hospitals, and six
7 thousand one hundred are treated in emergency departments as a
8 result of falls.
9 The legislature further finds that falls among the elderly
10 also result in over $100,000,000 in combined hospital charges
11 each year. In recognition of this critical public health issue.
12 Act 153, Session Laws of Hawaii 2014 (Act 153) , established and
13 provided funding for a fall prevention and early detection
14 coordinator position within the department of health's emergency
15 medical services and injury prevention system branch. This
16 position enables the department of health to support a

C.D. 1
1 coordinated statewide approach to prevent and reduce the impact
2 of falls among older adults.
3 The legislature also finds that access to fall prevention
4 services and programs would significantly reduce costs
5 associated with falls among older adults by expediting
6 treatment, minimize serious long-term consequences, reduce the
7 extent of the injury, and, in some instances, avoid death.
8 Falls among older adults are a significant public health
9 issue. Yet, there are insufficient resources to develop a
10 coordinated statewide approach to reduce and promptly detect
11 falls among seniors. A dedicated fall prevention program can
12 serve as a focal point for statewide injury prevention and
13 detection efforts to ensure multidisciplinary support,
14 coordination of prevention and detection efforts, and continuity
15 of implementation and accountability.
16 The legislature additionally finds that continued support
17 of fall prevention programs and services ultimately results in
18 longer, healthier lives for the State's aging population.
19 The purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds to the
20 department of health for the current fall prevention campaign.
