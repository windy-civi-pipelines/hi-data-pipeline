STATE OF HAWAII S.D. 1
C.D. 2
A BILL FORAN ACT
RELATING TO FIREWORKS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the widespread use
2 of illegal fireworks poses an extreme danger and lethal risk to
3 public health and safety, resulting in fires, serious burn
4 injuries, and fatalities to innocent bystanders. The cost to
5 the community far outweighs any intrinsic benefit, as numerous
6 lives have been lost over the years from the use of illegal
7 fireworks. In addition, the potential for wildfires in this
8 time of climate change is a real and present danger and is a top
9 priority for all levels of government.
10 Tragedies like the New Year's Eve explosion of 2024 have
11 injured or claimed the lives of the elderly, adults, and
12 children, seriously impacting entire neighborhoods in the middle
13 of urban Honolulu and across the State.
14 Fireworks also emit excessive smoke and other toxins into
15 the air, making breathing difficult for thousands of Hawaii
16 residents with respiratory ailments. Noise from loud fireworks
17 traumatizes many residents, particularly war veterans who may

1 suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder from being in combat.
2 Pets and vulnerable species in their natural habitats also must
3 suffer each holiday season when fireworks noise and
4 environmental pollution commences.
5 With the increase in fireworks-related calls, public safety
6 agencies are heavily strained to maintain adequate response
7 levels for other critical emergencies, which adds to the cost of
8 state and county resources that could be used for natural
9 disasters and other emergencies. They are often overwhelmed and
10 are not able to stop the thousands of illegal fireworks being
11 used, making it a death trap for thousands of innocent lives who
12 are not involved in illegal fireworks use.
13 The legislature further finds that people in the State
14 deserve to live in peace and security without the public safety
15 risk and disruptive impact of illegal fireworks. There can be
16 no more gray areas when lives are lost while this black market
17 flourishes.
18 The legislature also finds that improved enforcement of the
19 fireworks control laws is necessary, not only to protect
20 property from avoidable fire damage, but also to protect the
21 community from fire- and explosion-related injuries, respiratory

1 distress caused by the air pollution, and recurring trauma to
2 afflicted persons due to loud explosions.
3 The legislature believes that a more robust continuum of
4 enforcement mechanisms must be established to promote compliance
5 with the fireworks control laws. This includes implementing
6 graduated penalties for repeat or felony-level offenses,
7 imposing enhanced penalties for offenses that result in injury
8 or death, and adjudicating fireworks infractions under the same
9 system used for traffic and emergency period infractions. The
10 fireworks infractions system will allow law enforcement agencies
11 and the judiciary to quickly and efficiently process low-level
12 cases, while also allowing them to prioritize higher-level cases
13 as appropriate.
14 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
15 (1) Establish various criminal offenses and penalties
16 related to fireworks or articles pyrotechnic;
17 (2) TVnend and establish various definitions and penalties
18 for fireworks offenses, including establishing
19 heightened penalties under certain circumstances; and

4 SECTION 2. Chapter 132D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
5 amended by adding seven new sections to be appropriately
6 designated and to read as follows:

3 SECTION 18. Section 291D-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
4 amended to read as follows:
5 '’§291D-1 Puirpose. (a) Act 222, Session Laws of Hawaii
6 1978, began the process of decriminalizing certain traffic
7 offenses, not of a serious nature, to the status of violations.
8 In response to a request by the legislature, the judiciary
9 prepared a report in 1987 that recommended, among other things,
10 further decriminalization of traffic offenses, elimination of
11 most traffic arraignments, disposition of uncontested violations
12 by mail, and informal hearings where the violation or the
13 proposed penalty is questioned. The legislature finds that
14 further decriminalization of certain traffic offenses and
15 streamlining of the handling of those traffic cases will achieve
16 a more expeditious system for the judicial processing of traffic
17 infractions. The system of processing traffic infractions
18 established by this chapter will:
19 (1) Eliminate the long and tedious arraignment proceeding
20 for a majority of traffic matters;
2025-3515 HB1483 CD2 HMSO 49

Page 50 H■ ■ .B. Nik ■ O. 1483
h.d.1
C.D. 2
1 (2) Facilitate and encourage the resolution of many
2 traffic infractions through the payment of a monetary
3 assessment;
4 (3) Speed the disposition of contested cases through a
5 hearing, similar to small claims proceedings, in which
6 the rules of evidence will not apply and the court
7 will consider as evidence the notice of traffic
8 infraction, applicable police reports, or other
9 written statements by the police officer who issued
10 the notice, any other relevant written material, and
11 any evidence or statements by the person contesting
12 the notice of traffic infraction;
13 (4) Dispense in most cases with the need for witnesses,
14 including law enforcement officers, to be present and
15 for the participation of the prosecuting attorney;
16 (5) Allow judicial, prosecutorial, and law enforcement
17 resources to be used more efficiently and effectively;
18 and
19 (6) Save the taxpayers money and reduce their frustration
20 with the judicial system by simplifying the traffic
21 court process.

1 The legislature further finds that this chapter will not require
2 expansion of the current traffic division of the district
3 courts, but will achieve greater efficiency through more
4 effective use of existing resources of the district courts.
5 (b) The legislature finds that the pandemic related to the
6 coronavirus disease 2019 necessitated the imposition of
7 emergency period rules in an attempt to control the spread of
8 the disease in the State. The thousands of violations of the
9 emergency period rules caused an examination of the ability to
10 impose infractions for lesser offenses as an alternative to
11 using the Penal Code and to allow for more efficient use of the
12 judicial system. The system of processing traffic infractions
13 under this chapter was enacted in 1993 and has provided a useful
14 mechanism for handling offenses deemed as infractions and is
15 well-suited to certain types of violations of emergency period
16 rules that are designated infractions by the governor or mayor
17 under the state's emergency management laws.
18 (c) The legislature further finds that the illegal use of
19 fireworks poses a serious public health and safety hazard. Due
20 to the high number of fireworks being set off throughout the
21 State, an expeditious adjudication system for fireworks

1 infractions, such as the system for processing traffic
2 infractions, will allow the judiciary to expediently process
3 violations of the fireworks control law. This system will allow
4 the judiciary to reserve resources for cases that require more
5 resources."
6 SECTION 19. Section 291D-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
7 amended as follows:
8 1. By adding a new definition to be appropriately inserted
9 and to read:
10 ""Fireworks infraction" means any violation of chapter 132D

13 ordinance or rule enacted pursuant to chapter 132D."
