Section 1:
HB1385 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1385 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to the state flag. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the current state flag of Hawaii is rooted in the legacy of the Hawaiian Kingdom, having been commissioned by King Kamehameha III in 1843 as a symbol of the sovereignty and unity of the Hawaiian people under the independent Hawaiian Kingdom.  The overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1893 by forces supported by foreign interests constituted a profound historical injustice that continues to deeply impact Native Hawaiians and their cultural identity today. The use of the Hawaiian Kingdom's flag as the emblem of the State of Hawaii intertwines a symbol of a sovereign kingdom with a political entity formed under circumstances of colonization and annexation, thereby conflating the historical significance of the flag with the structures of state governance.  Many view the Hawaiian Kingdom's flag as a sacred and enduring symbol of the lahui and its independence, which should remain the rightful domain of the Hawaiian Kingdom and its legacy rather than that of the State of Hawaii. The legislature further finds there is an opportunity to reflect the diverse and multicultural identity of Hawaii in a manner that honors its Native Hawaiian foundation and acknowledges its contemporary evolution as a state. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish a Hawaii state flag redesign commission to explore and recommend a new design for the flag of the State of Hawaii that respects the historical and cultural significance of the Hawaiian Kingdom's flag and fosters a unifying and inclusive symbol for all the people of Hawaii through a process that is transparent, inclusive, and guided by a commitment to justice and reconciliation. SECTION 2.  (a) There is established the Hawaii state flag redesign commission within the department of accounting and general services for administrative purposes.  The purpose of the commission shall be to lead the process of designing a new state flag that represents the people, culture, and history of Hawaii. (b)  The commission shall consist of the following members: (1)  The executive director of the state foundation on culture and the arts or the executive director's designee, who shall serve as the chairperson; (2)  Two members of the senate, to be appointed by the president of the senate; (3)  Two members of the house of representatives, to be appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives; (4)  Four members representing Native Hawaiian organizations, to be invited by the chairperson; and (5)  Four cultural historians, to be invited by the chairperson. (c)  The commission shall: (1)  Lead community engagement; (2)  Conduct public education campaigns; (3)  Host forums and workshops; and (4)  Solicit design proposals from the public and, upon completion of the review process, evaluate and adopt a final design for approval by the legislature. (d)  Members of the commission shall serve without compensation but may be reimbursed for necessary expenses incurred during the performance of their duties. (e)  The commission shall submit a report of its findings and recommendations, including the final design adopted by the commission and any proposed legislation, to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 2026.
