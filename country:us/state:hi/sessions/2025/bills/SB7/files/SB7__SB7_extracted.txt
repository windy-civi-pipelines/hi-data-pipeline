Section 1:
SB7 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 7 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to HEALTHY WORKPLACES. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the social and economic well-being of the State is dependent upon healthy and productive employees.  The legislature further finds that workplace bullying, mobbing, and harassment can inflict serious harm upon targeted employees, including feelings of shame and humiliation, severe anxiety, depression, suicidal tendencies, cardiovascular disease, and symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder.  The legislature also finds that abusive work environments can have serious consequences for employers, including reduced employee productivity and morale, higher turnover and absenteeism rates, and increases in medical and workers' compensation claims. The legislature finds, however, that if employees who have been subjected to abusive treatment at work cannot establish that the abusive behavior was motivated by race, color, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, age, or other category protected under existing employment discrimination laws, the targeted employee is unlikely to be legally protected against the abusive treatment.  The legislature finds that legal protection from abusive work environments should not be limited to behavior grounded in protected class status.  Furthermore, existing workers' compensation laws and common-law tort actions are inadequate to discourage this behavior or to provide adequate relief to employees who have been harmed by abusive work environments. SECTION 2. Chapter 378, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part .  HEALTHY WORKPLACE ACT §378-A  Definitions.  As used in this part: "Abusive conduct" means unwelcome, degrading, and dehumanizing conduct that is severe or pervasive enough to create a work environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive. "Abusive conduct" may be perpetrated by one or more persons.  "Abusive conduct" does not include petty slights, annoyances, and isolated incidents, unless serious. "Employee" means any person who renders services to an employer, contractor, or any other entity and receives compensation for those services. "Employee" includes full- and part-time paid employees, temporary employees, contracted employees, and independent contractors. "Employer" has the same meaning as defined in section 378‑1. "Representative employee" means an employee in a leadership, management, or legal position whose responsibility is to advise on, oversee, or enforce organizational policies. §378-B  Work environment; abusive conduct; employer responsibilities; retaliation; prohibited. (a)  It shall be unlawful for any employer or employee to subject an employee to abusive conduct.  Factors to be considered in determining whether conduct qualifies as abusive include but are not limited to: (1)  The nature, frequency, and duration of the conduct; (2)  The context in which the conduct occurs; and (3)  A review of the totality of the circumstances. (b) Employers and representative employees shall take all reasonable preventative and responsive measures to ensure a healthy work environment free of abusive conduct, including: (1)  Acknowledging and responding to complaints of abusive conduct within a reasonable time frame appropriate to the level of urgency; (2)  Establishing and implementing a transparent and timely complaint process that includes a prompt, thorough, and unbiased fact-finding investigation and issuance of a timely and accurate report of findings; (3)  Establishing and implementing a transparent disciplinary process commensurate with the severity of the abusive conduct within a reasonable time frame, if applicable, including taking the following disciplinary action against the employee who was found to have engaged in abusive conduct: (A)  Coaching; (B)  Counseling; (C)  Issuance of a warning; (D)  Removal of supervisory duties; (E)  Termination; or (F)  Other disciplinary action; (4)  Maintaining accurate records of complaints, findings, and disciplinary actions; (5)  Before December 31, 2025, adopting, distributing, posting, and otherwise providing all employees with a written healthy workplace policy providing protections for employees against all forms of abusive conduct, including an anti-retaliation policy and description of methods to report or file a complaint of abusive conduct or retaliation, consistent with this section and all applicable laws.  The written policy shall be distributed to employees on a regular basis; and (6)  Training all employees on the healthy workplace policy. (c) It shall be unlawful for an employer or representative employee to: (1)  Engage in, offer, or require an employee to engage in mediation or arbitration of an abusive conduct complaint before the employee retains legal counsel; (2)  Enter into, offer, or require an employee to enter into a non-disclosure or non-disparagement agreement related to an abusive conduct complaint; or (3)  Take adverse employment action against an employee who opposes a violation of this section or exercises a right under this section, including: (A)  Forced resignation; (B)  Termination; (C)  Demotion; (D)  Unfavorable reassignment; (E)  Failure to promote; (F)  Disciplinary action; (G)  Reduction in compensation; (H)  Constructive discharge; or (I)  Other similar actions. §378-C  Penalty.  Any employer who is in violation of subsection 378-B(b)(5) or (6) shall be fined not more than $100 for each violation. §378-D  Private cause of action.  (a)  A person who alleges a violation of this part may bring a civil action against the employer or employee in violation for appropriate injunctive relief, or damages, or both within three years after the occurrence of the last act that constitutes the alleged violation of this part. (b) An action commenced pursuant to subsection (a) may be brought in the circuit court for the circuit where the alleged violation occurred, where the complainant resides, or where the person against whom the civil complaint is filed resides or has a principal place of business. (c)  A complainant bringing a civil action pursuant to subsection (a) may proceed using a pseudonym for the true name of the complainant and may exclude or redact from all pleadings and documents filed in the action other identifying characteristics of the complainant.  In cases where a complainant proceeds using a pseudonym: (1)  A party excluding or redacting identifying characteristics as provided in this subsection shall file with the court and serve upon all other parties a confidential information form that includes the complainant's name and other identifying characteristics excluded or redacted.  The court shall keep the complainant's name and excluded or redacted characteristics confidential; (2)  All other parties and their agents and attorneys shall use the pseudonym in all pleadings, discovery documents, and other documents filed or served in the action, and at hearings, trial, and other court proceedings that are open to the public; (3)  Any party filing a pleading, discovery document, or other document in the action shall exclude or redact any identifying characteristics of the complainant from the pleading, discovery document, or other document, except for a confidential information form filed pursuant to this subdivision; and (4)  All court decisions, orders, petitions, discovery documents, and other documents shall be worded to protect the name or other identifying characteristics of the complainant from public revelation. The responsibility for excluding or redacting the name or identifying characteristics of the complainant from all documents filed with the court rests solely with the parties and their attorneys.  Nothing in this subsection requires the court to review pleadings or other papers for compliance with this provision. §378-E Remedies ordered by court.  (a)  Except as provided in section 378-C, a court, in rendering a judgment in an action brought pursuant to this part, shall order, as the court considers appropriate: (1)  Compensatory damages, including economic and noneconomic damages; (2)  Punitive damages; provided that the violation is extreme or egregious; (3)  Injunctive relief to enjoin the defendant from continuing any violation of this part; (4)  Restorative measures; (5)  Any other relief the court considers appropriate; or (6)  Any combination of these remedies; provided that the total amount of damages awarded to the complainant shall be the greater of the aggregate of all damages deemed appropriate by the court pursuant to this subsection or $5,000 for each violation of subsection 378-B(a), (b), or (c), for a maximum of $15,000.
