WHEREAS, during the second world war, the United States government incarcerated more than one hundred twenty thousand residents of Japanese ancestry in internment camps throughout the continental United States; and WHEREAS, more than half of the people of Japanese ancestry who were forcibly detained without charges or the right to an appeal were American citizens; and WHEREAS, thousands of Japanese Americans lost their homes, rights, and freedom during this time as a direct result of systemic anti-Asian racism in the United States; and WHEREAS, second-generation Japanese American men who were born and raised in the United States were still encouraged to join and were even drafted into the United States military to fight for their country that classified them as "enemy aliens" on the basis of their race; and WHEREAS, altogether, more than thirty thousand Japanese Americans served with distinction in the United States military in segregated units during the second world war; and WHEREAS, the most renowned group of Japanese Americans to fight for the United States in this war was the 442nd Regimental Combat Team; and WHEREAS, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team was the most decorated unit for its size and length of service during the entire history of the United States military; and WHEREAS, in total, approximately fourteen thousand men served in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, the vast majority of whom were Nisei, or children of Japanese immigrants born in the continental United States or the Territory of Hawaii; and WHEREAS, two-thirds of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team were Hawaii-born Nisei, including Medal of Honor recipient and late United States Senator Daniel K.
