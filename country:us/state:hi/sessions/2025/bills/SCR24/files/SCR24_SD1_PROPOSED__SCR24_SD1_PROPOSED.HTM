<div class=WordSection2>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, during the second world war, the United
States government incarcerated more than one hundred twenty thousand residents
of Japanese ancestry in internment camps throughout the continental United
States; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, more than half of the people of Japanese
ancestry who were forcibly detained without charges or the right to an appeal
were American citizens; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, thousands of Japanese Americans lost
their homes, rights, and freedom during this time as a direct result of systemic
anti-Asian racism in the United States; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, second-generation Japanese American men
who were born and raised in the United States were still encouraged to join and
were even drafted into the United States military to fight for their country
that classified them as &quot;enemy aliens&quot; on the basis of their race;
and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, altogether, more than thirty thousand
Japanese Americans served with distinction in the United States military in
segregated units during the second world war; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, the most renowned group of Japanese
Americans to fight for the United States in this war was the 442<sup>nd</sup>
Regimental Combat Team; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, the 442<sup>nd</sup> Regimental Combat
Team was the most decorated unit for its size and length of service during the
entire history of the United States military; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, in total, approximately fourteen thousand
men served in the 442<sup>nd</sup> Regimental Combat Team, the vast majority of
whom were Nisei, or children of Japanese immigrants born in the continental
United States or the Territory of Hawaii; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, two-thirds of the 442<sup>nd</sup>
Regimental Combat Team were Hawaii-born Nisei, including Medal of Honor
recipient and late United States Senator Daniel K. Inouye; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS; Hawaii historically played a crucial role
in the Indo-Pacific theater and continues to provide critical resources to the
United States military; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, recognizing the history of the 442<sup>nd</sup>
Regimental Combat Team is of vital importance to acknowledging the
contributions of the people of Hawaii to securing the freedoms enjoyed by
Americans today; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody style='text-indent:.5in'>WHEREAS, recognizing the
history of the 442<sup>nd</sup> Regimental Combat Team is fundamental to sustaining
the memory and honoring the sacrifices of the brave Japanese-Americans who
substantially contributed to the war efforts of the United States while many of
their families were incarcerated by the American government on the basis of
their race; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, on or about March 5<sup>th</sup>, 2025,
the Pentagon removed information pertaining to the 442<sup>nd</sup> Regimental
Combat Team from the United States Army's official website amid a federal purge
of content identified as being related to diversity, equity, and inclusion
(DEI); and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, Hawaii is a state composed of an
extremely diverse population that celebrates and respects cultural diversity,
equity, and inclusion; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, the Legislature does not support the
removal of historical references to intersectional minorities and holds that
the selective erasure of history is a dangerous act that facilitates the
repetition of horrific injustices of the past; now, therefore,</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the Thirty-third
Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, the House of
Representatives concurring, that the United States Department of Defense is
strongly urged to maintain all references to the 442<sup>nd</sup> Regimental
Combat Team on its websites for the public; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the United States
Department of Defense is strongly urged to maintain all references to
intersectional minorities in its media as the recording of history involving
those individuals who happen to be characterized as minorities is not an act of
elevating minorities above non-minorities; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Hawaii State
Senate, with the House of Representatives concurring, remain vigilant in
support of social justice, civil rights, equal protection, and upholding the
rule of law; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of
this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the United States Secretary of
Defense; Chief of Staff of the United States Army; Chief of the National Guard
Bureau; Lieutenant Governor; each member of Hawaii's congressional delegation;
Governor; Adjutant General; Chair of the Hawaii Civil Rights Commission;
