STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 3
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO RENEWABLE ENERGY.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that Hawaii has committed
2 to achieving a one hundred per cent renewable portfolio standard
3 by December 31, 2045. The transition away from imported fossil
4 fuels toward locally available renewable energy sources is
5 critical for ensuring the State's energy independence, economic
6 sustainability, and environmental resilience.
7 The legislature further finds that customer-sited
8 distributed energy resources, such as rooftop solar and energy
9 storage systems, are technologies essential to reaching the
10 State's renewable energy goals. As of September 2024, Hawaiian
11 Electric's service territories achieved a renewable portfolio
12 standard of 36.7 per cent, with nearly half of that progress
13 attributable to customer-sited rooftop solar systems. Kauai
14 Island Utility Cooperative achieved an even higher renewable
15 portfolio standard of 57.9 per cent, with 23.2 per cent
16 attributable to rooftop solar installations.

C.D. 1
1 Hawaii leads the nation in the integration of
2 solar-plus-storage systems, with ninety-six per cent of all
3 residential rooftop solar installation in the State now
4 including energy storage. These distributed energy resources
5 lower customer and grid electricity costs, provide energy
6 resilience during outages, and support grid reliability by
7 balancing supply and demand. Notably, programs like Hawaiian
8 Electric's battery bonus program have demonstrated the potential
9 of distributed energy resources to address critical capacity
10 needs, enrolling forty megawatts of storage on Oahu and six
11 megawatts on Maui to respond to energy adequacy and reliability
12 emergencies.
13 The legislature acknowledges that Hawaii's electric grid is
14 confronting significant challenges, including aging
15 fossil-fuel-dependent infrastructure, heightened risks from
16 climate-related extreme weather events, and persistent utility
17 management issues. These challenges have been underscored by
18 recent grid reliability emergencies on Oahu and Hawaii island,
19 as well as the devastating 2023 Maui wildfires. Recognizing the
20 urgent need for decisive action, it is crucial for the
2025-2774 SB589 GDI SMA-2.docx 2

Page 3
S.B. NO.

H.D. 3
C.D. 1
1 legislature to act promptly to secure a robust and resilient
2 energy future.
3 The legislature also finds that to ensure grid stability
4 and system resilience, Hawaii must invest in distributed energy
5 resource grid service programs, microgrids, and community-based
6 or shared renewable energy programs. These solutions empower
7 customers to take decisive action to meet their energy needs
8 with low-cost, clean, and reliable energy while supporting
9 broader grid stability and community resilience. Microgrids and
10 shared renewable energy systems enable localized energy
11 generation and resilience, ensuring continuity of power during
12 emergencies or outages.
13 To meet these challenges, Hawaii should encourage the
14 deployment of distributed energy resources, emphasizing systems
15 that integrate solar and energy storage to maximize benefits for
16 the grid and customers alike. Accelerated distributed energy
17 resources adoption will provide critical support for grid
18 stability, reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels, and ensure
19 resilience in the face of emergencies and infrastructure
20 failures.

C.D. 1
1 Fair compensation mechanisms are also essential to
2 incentivize the widespread adoption of distributed energy
3 resources and maximize their value to customers and the grid.
4 These mechanisms must include sufficiently valued crediting for
5 exported energy as a minimum customer protection and capacity
6 and performance payments for the provision of grid services by
7 distributed energy resources and virtual power plants. Such
8 compensation ensures equitable returns on customer investments
9 while enhancing grid reliability and resilience.
10 The purpose of this Act is to:
11 (1) Require the public utilities commission to establish
12 an installation goal for new customer-sited
13 distributed energy resources in the State;
14 (2) Require the public utilities commission to establish
15 tariffs to achieve the installation goal and for grid
16 services programs, microgrids, and community-based
17 renewable energy;
18 (3) Ensure that sufficient compensation is provided to
19 distributed energy resources exports as part of grid
20 service programs and require the public utilities

1 commission to establish grid service compensation
2 values;
3 (4) Clarify when a person who constructs, maintains, or
4 operates a new microgrid is not considered a public
5 utility; and
6 (5) Authorize wheeling of renewable energy and require the
7 public utilities commission to establish policies and
8 procedures to implement wheeling and microgrid service
9 tariffs.
10 SECTION 2. Chapter 269, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
11 amended by adding four new sections to be appropriately
12 designated and to read as follows:
13 "§269-A Distributed energy resources installation goal;
14 tariffs; requirements. (a) The public utilities commission
15 shall establish a goal for new customer-sited distributed energy
16 resources, to be installed in the State by December 31, 2030.
17 (b) The public utilities commission shall establish
18 tariffs for grid services programs, microgrids, and community­
19 based renewable energy with fair compensation to achieve the
20 goal established pursuant to subsection (a).

15 (3) Provide for measurement and verification of energy
16 storage device performance directly at the device
17 without the requirement for the installation of an
18 additional meter, and other measurement standards for
19 non-energy-storage and electric vehicle technologies
20 for approval by the commission.

9 commission shall establish, by rule or order, policies and
10 procedures to implement wheeling and microgrid service tariffs
11 that include appropriate charges for wheeling participants and
12 any consumer protection measures the commission deems necessary;
13 provided that any wheeling project eligible under the rule or
14 order shall have a capacity of not less than one hundred
15 kilowatts alternating current and not more than two megawatts
16 alternating current.
