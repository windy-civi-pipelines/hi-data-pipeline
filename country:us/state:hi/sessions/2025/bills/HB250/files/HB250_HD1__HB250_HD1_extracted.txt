HB250 HD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 250 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO HEALTH. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that prior authorization is a health plan cost control process that requires physicians, health care professionals, and hospitals to obtain advance approval from a health plan before a specific service to a patient to qualify for payment or coverage.  Each plan has its own policies and procedures that health care providers are required to navigate to have services they prescribe for their patients approved for payment before being provided to the patient.  Each health plan uses its own standards, methods, the individual judgment of an employed medical director, or advice from a contracted firm for determining the medical necessity of the services prescribed, which are not transparent or clear to the prescribing clinician or health care provider. The legislature further finds that there is emerging consensus among health care providers that prior authorization increases administrative burdens and costs.  In the 2023 physician workforce report published by the university of Hawaii John A. Burns school of medicine, physicians voted prior authorization as their top concern regarding administrative burden.  Furthermore, a physician survey conducted by the American Medical Association reported that ninety-five per cent of physicians attribute prior authorization to somewhat or significantly increased physician burnout, and that more than one-in-three have staff who work exclusively on prior authorization.  The survey also found that: (1)  Eighty-three per cent of prior authorization denials were subsequently overturned by health plans; (2)  Ninety-four per cent of respondents said that the prior authorization process always, often, or sometimes delays care; (3)  Nineteen per cent of respondents said prior authorization resulted in a serious adverse event leading to a patient being hospitalized; (4)  Thirteen per cent of respondents said prior authorization resulted in a serious adverse event leading to a life-threatening event or requiring intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage; and (5)  Seven per cent of respondents said prior authorization resulted in a serious adverse event leading to a patient's disability, permanent body damage, congenital anomaly, birth defect, or death. The legislature believes that reducing the burdens of prior authorization will assist health care providers, thereby ensuring the health and safety of their patients. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Examine prior authorization practices in the State by requiring utilization review entities to report certain data to the state health planning and development agency; (2)  Establish timelines for the approval of prior authorization requests to reduce delays for urgent and non-urgent health care services; and (3)  Establish the health care appropriateness and necessity working group to make recommendations to improve and expedite the prior authorization process. SECTION 2.  Chapter 323D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding four new sections to part II to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§323D-     Prior authorization; reporting.  (a)  Each utilization review entity doing business in the State shall file an annual report containing data related to the prior authorization of health care services for the preceding calendar year with the state agency no later than January 1 of each year, in a form and manner prescribed by the state agency.  The state agency shall post each report on its website no later than three months before the start of the reporting period. (b)  The state agency shall compile the data in each report by provider of health insurance, health care setting, and line of business, and shall post a report of findings, including recommendations, on its website no later than March 1 of the following year after the reporting period. §323D-     Prior authorization for non-urgent health care services; submission of request; determination time frame; automatic approval.  (a) A health care professional shall submit a prior authorization request for a non-urgent health care to the utilization review entity no later than five calendar days before the provision of the health care service. (b)  A prior authorization request submitted pursuant to subsection (a) shall be deemed approved forty-eight hours after the submission of the request if the utilization review entity fails to: (1)  Approve or deny the request and notify the enrollee or the enrollee's health care facility or health care professional; (2)  Request from the health care facility or health care professional all additional information needed to render a decision; or (3)  Notify the health care facility or health care professional that prior authorization is being questioned for medical necessity, within the forty-eight-hour period.  The utilization review entity shall have an additional twenty-four hours to process the request from the time the health care facility or health care professional submits the additional information requested pursuant to paragraph (2). (c)  Any health care facility or health care professional who fails to submit the information requested pursuant to subsection (b)(2) within twenty-four hours shall submit a new prior authorization request. §323D-     Prior authorization request for urgent health care services; determination time frame; automatic approval.  (a)  A prior authorization request submitted for an urgent health care service shall be deemed approved twenty-four hours after the submission of the request if the utilization review entity fails to: (1)  Approve or deny the request and notify the enrollee or the enrollee's health care provider; (2)  Request from the health care facility or health care professional all additional information needed to render a decision; or (3)  Notify the health care facility or health care professional that prior authorization is being questioned for medical necessity, within the twenty-four-hour period.  The utilization review entity shall have an additional twelve hours to process the request from the time the health care facility or health care professional submits the additional information requested pursuant to paragraph (2).

(b)  The members of the working group shall consist of the following: (1)  Five members representing insurers and utilization review entities, three of whom shall be appointed by the governor, one of whom shall be appointed by the president of the senate, and one of whom shall be appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives; (2)  Five members representing physicians, hospitals, and other licensed health care professionals, three of whom shall be appointed by the governor, one of whom shall be appointed by the president of the senate, and one of whom shall be appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives; and (3)  Five members representing consumers of health care, three of whom shall be appointed by the governor, one of whom shall be appointed by the president of the senate, and one of whom shall be appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives.
