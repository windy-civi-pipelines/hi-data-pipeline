illegal overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii; the transfer of approximately
1,800,000 acres of crown, government, and public lands to the United States
under the 1898 Joint Resolution of Annexation without the consent of and
without compensation to the native Hawaiian people or their sovereign
government; the admission of Hawaii as a state of the Union in 1959, with the
explicit trust responsibility and requirement in section 5(f) of the 1959 Admission
Act that one of the five purposes of the public land trust is that the income
and proceeds from the public land trust are to be used &quot;for the betterment
of the conditions of native Hawaiians&quot;; and the 1978 Constitutional
Convention's recognition that native Hawaiians are one of the beneficiaries of
the public land trust and the creation of OHA to manage and administer the
specific allocation of &quot;all income and proceeds from that pro rata portion
of the [public land] trust . . . for native Hawaiians&quot; (Article XII,
section 6, of the Hawaii State Constitution).  The United States and the courts
have consistently affirmed the trust nature of the government and crown lands,
including large tracts of ceded lands used for military or other purposes under
federal control.</p>

obligation to native Hawaiians by ratifying constitutional amendments from the
Constitutional Convention, including article XII, sections 4, 5, and 6, of the
Hawaii State Constitution, which established OHA and charged it with managing
income and proceeds from the public land trust for the benefit of native
Hawaiians.  Article XVI, section 7, of the Hawaii State Constitution required
the State to enact legislation to comply with its trust obligations.  Thus, in
1979, legislation, codified as chapter 10, Hawaii Revised Statutes, set forth
the purposes of OHA and described the duties of its trustees.</p>

public land trust[.]&quot;  This legislative directive addressing the
constitutional mandate has led to a series of lawsuits and legislative
enactments concerning OHA's constitutional pro rata share of the public land

to the legislature.  The measure also set a fixed amount of $15,100,000 from

from the public land trust owed to OHA by implementing an agreement between the
State and OHA for the State to convey certain lands in Kakaako, Oahu, to OHA
valued at approximately $200,000,000.  Act 15 did not, however, address the
State's constitutional obligations relating to OHA's twenty per cent pro rata
share of the income and proceeds from the public land trust generated after
June 30, 2012.  Notably, a 2015-2016 financial review initiated by OHA found
that the minimum amount of total gross receipts from sources that OHA has
historically claimed was approximately $394,322,163 in the fiscal year 2015-2016. 
Twenty per cent of this gross amount is approximately $78,900,000.&quot;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs style='margin-right:.75in;text-align:justify;
text-justify:inter-ideograph'>     Act 226 was enacted to:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Increase the office of Hawaiian affairs' interim
annual share of the income and proceeds of the public land trust beginning in
fiscal year 2022-2023 from $15,100,000 to $21,500,000;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Appropriate $64,000,000 to the office of Hawaiian

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Conference Committee Report No. 250-22 filed
with S.B. No. 2021, S.D. 1, H.D. 2, C.D. 1, which would later be enacted as Act
226, further found that &quot;the past-due sum owed to the Office of Hawaiian
Affairs for any and all underpayments of the pro-rata portion of the income and
proceeds of the Public Land Trust for the period from July 1, 2012, to June 30,
2022, is $64,000,000, and that this sum is intended to represent the cumulative
impact of an inflation adjustment for that period.&quot;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature finds that Act 15 and Act 226
have addressed past-due amounts that accumulated during the period between
November 7, 1978, up to and including June 30, 2022, of income and proceeds
from the public land trust owed to the office of Hawaiian affairs.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature finds that Act 54, Session Laws
of Hawaii 2011 (Act 54), mandates the establishment of a comprehensive
information system to inventory and maintain information about the lands of the
public land trust as described in section 5(f) of the Admission Act and article
XII, section 4 of the state constitution.  The department of land and natural
resources worked with a consultant to develop a public land trust information
system (information system) to satisfy the requirements of Act 54.  The information
system will be a geographic information system that is intended for a complete
inventory of all state-owned and county-owned lands, as well as a complete
inventory of encumbrances issued by state and county agencies over these
lands.  To meet these goals, each state or county agency must submit
comprehensive lists of its land and encumbrance inventories.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature further finds that the working
group established under Act 226 was assigned to:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Account for all ceded lands in the public land
trust inventory;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Account for all income and proceeds from the
public land trust; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Subsequently determine the twenty per cent pro rata
share of income and proceeds from the public land trust due annually to the
office of Hawaiian affairs for the betterment of the conditions of Native
Hawaiians.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     In December 2023, the working group submitted
to all state agencies that hold title to, maintain management control over, or
otherwise use ceded lands, a written request to provide information, data,
documents, and maps to ensure that those agencies have completely and
accurately identified and reported to the department of land and natural
resources:  (1) all ceded land parcels for the purpose of an inventory; and (2)
all income and proceeds collected or received from the public land trust.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The working group has been informed that the
last financial review by an outside independent accounting firm of the pro rata
share was the fiscal year 2015-2016 financial review initiated by the office of
Hawaiian affairs.  At the time, the financial review identified total gross
receipts from historically claimed public land trust revenue sources in the
minimum amount of approximately $394,322,163 in the fiscal year 2015-2016. 
Twenty per cent of this gross amount is approximately $78,900,000.  The working
group found that there has been no new financial review since the 2015-2016
financial review.  The 2016 financial review cost $145,404.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature notes that Act 178, Session
Laws of Hawaii 2006 (Act 178), requires the department of land and natural
resources, with the cooperation of the department of budget and finance and any
other state department or agency that uses or manages public lands, to provide
an accounting of all receipts from lands described in section 5(f) of the
Admission Act for the prior fiscal year.  The working group has been informed
that state agencies' self-reported information for the purposes of these reports
is not audited or reviewed for accuracy by the department of land and natural
resources.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The working group has been informed that work
began on the process to procure a consultant for the information system after
the enactment of Act 54 and that the development of the information system
began in 2012 and the information system was launched in October 2018.  Act 54
appropriated up to $360,000 from a land conservation fund for the work by an
outside independent consultant.  The final amount for the creation of the
information system and training was $340,382.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     As part of the implementation of the
information system, all state and county agencies that hold title to land are
required to submit their entire land inventory, regardless of the public land
trust status, regardless of whether there are any encumbrances on the land, and
regardless of whether revenue is being generated on the land.  All state and
county agencies are additionally required to submit encumbrances that they have
issued over state-owned and county-owned land, regardless of whether they hold
title to that land or not and regardless of whether they were revenue
generating.  This includes all encumbrances, including leases, permits, right&#8209;of&#8209;entries,
and easements.  The goal was to have all encumbrances issued over state-owned
and county-owned land represented in the information system.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     As with the reporting to the department of land
and natural resources on public land trust revenues, the information system is
also based on self-reporting by state agencies and the counties.  There are
some disclaimers about the information.  The department of land and natural
resources has encouraged all state and county departments to regularly update
data in the system.  Updates, however, are also based on self-reported
information.  The legislature believes that independent third&#8209;party
professionals need to evaluate this practice.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The working group has been informed that when a
parcel consists of both ceded and nonceded lands, the state agencies use a
&quot;rule of thumb&quot; to determine whether a parcel is ceded or not.  When
more than fifty per cent of a parcel is ceded land, it is categorized as
ceded.  The working group has been unable to determine whether this is
detrimental to the calculation of the office of Hawaiian affairs' pro rata
share.  The legislature believes that independent third-party professionals
need to evaluate this practice.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The working group has been informed that there
are many parcels without tax map key numbers in the information system and
therefore may not be included in the system.  This is particularly so for
submerged lands, which are generally considered public land trust lands.  The
legislature believes that independent third-party professionals need to
evaluate how to include these parcels so that the information system contains
the complete and accurate inventory.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The working group has been informed that the
lands under federal jurisdiction are not included in the information system and
that the counties do not report any of the revenue from the public land trust
to the department of land and natural resources for the purposes of the annual
accounting required pursuant to Act 178 (Act 178 report).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     To the knowledge of the working group, there
has been no third-party independent audit, review, or evaluation of the
thoroughness and accuracy of the information system or the current reporting by
agencies for the purpose of preparing the annual Act 178 report, nor has there
been any analysis or comparison of the data in the information system with the
data in the Act 178 reports.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The working group has conducted research and
has determined that the services of one or more third-party independent
consultants with the necessary financial, accounting, and land inventory
expertise will be appropriate to address the concerns that have been raised
regarding the thoroughness and accuracy of the information system, to ensure
that the working group completes its objectives under Act 226.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Based on the amounts expended for the office of
Hawaiian affairs' 2016 financial review and the creation and launch of the
information system, which cost $485,786, the working group has estimated that
approximately $1,000,000 is needed for the retention of third-party independent
professionals.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Amend the membership and responsibilities of the
public land trust working group established pursuant to Act 226, Session Laws
