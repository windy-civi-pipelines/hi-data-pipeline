<p class=RegularParagraphs><a name="_Hlk114575812"><span style='line-height:
200%'>     </span></a><span style='line-height:200%'>SECTION 1.  The
legislature finds that f</span>ourteen states have adopted programs known as &quot;Universal
Purchase&quot; or &quot;Universal Select&quot; (collectively, UP), which provide
state-purchased access to some or all recommended immunizations to children and
adults in those states.  UP immunization purchases occur at a discounted price
through contracts otherwise intended for more established and familiar
immunization purchasing programs such as the Vaccines For Children Program (Public
Law 103-66) and Public Health Services Act, Section 317 Immunization Program
(Public Law 78-410).  Other varied state approaches include superseding private
sources of coverage and assessing health insurance plans for the cost of the
program and disallowing provider use of private immunization stock.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature further finds that states with
UP programs that allow state health officials to manage the supply of immunizations
lowered health care providers' administrative costs and ensured that the states
can quickly supply immunizations to vulnerable patient groups during
emergencies or immunization shortages.  The potential benefits to Hawaii's
health care and public health system make investment in a UP program
worthwhile.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The purpose of this Act is to establish a
universal immunization funding program in the State.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     SECTION 2.  Chapter 325, Hawaii Revised
Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to
read as follows:</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §325-&nbsp;&nbsp;  Assessments.</b>  (a) 
The director shall determine immunization assessment rates as follows:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Provide estimated child immunization costs and
estimated adult immunization costs, not covered by the vaccines for children
program or any of its successors, for the succeeding fiscal year no later than ninety
days before the commencement of each state fiscal year;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Add estimates to cover the department's operating
costs for the program;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Add a reserve of up to ten per cent of the sum of

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Subtract or add the amount of any surplus or

of the preceding state fiscal year; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  Calculate the immunization assessment rates as a
per&#8209;child covered life per month and per-adult covered life per month
amount to be self-reported and paid by all assessed entities by dividing the
annual amount determined in accordance with paragraphs (1) through (5) by the
number of children and adults, respectively, projected to be covered by the
assessed entities during the succeeding program year, divided by twelve.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  No later than forty-five days following
the close of each state fiscal year, the department shall provide an accounting
of immunization purchase funds not covered by any state or other program to
determine the final amount needed to cover the prior fiscal year.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Unless determined by the director, any assessed
entity that would otherwise be responsible for reimbursement to any provider
for any immunization administration shall be responsible for reporting the
child covered life and adult covered life and for payment of the corresponding
assessment to the department.  The department shall establish by rule the
frequency, schedule, and methodology of the assessments that the assessed
entities shall be subject to.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  At any time after one full calendar year
of operation under subsections (a) and (b), the director may make changes to
the assessment collection mechanism.  Any changes shall be reflected in an
updated plan of operation available to the public.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  If an assessed entity has not paid in
accordance with this section, interest shall accrue at one per cent per month,
compounded monthly on or after the due date.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The director may determine an interim
assessment for new immunizations or public health emergencies and shall
calculate a supplemental interim assessment using the methodology outlined
under subsection (a) for regular assessments, but payable within forty-five
days of the interim assessment notice.  The director shall not impose more than
one interim assessment per year, except in the case of a public health
emergency declared in accordance with federal or state law.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  For purposes of assessments, medical loss
ratio calculations, and reimbursement by plan sponsors, all association
assessments shall be considered pharmaceutical or medical benefit costs and not
regulatory or administrative costs.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  If the department discontinues operation
of the program for any reason, any unexpended assessments, including unexpended
funds from prior assessments in the universal immunization purchase special
fund, shall be refunded to assessed entities in proportion to the current
fiscal year's assessment rate.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §325-&nbsp;&nbsp;  Reports and audits.  </b>(a) 
The department shall audit assessed entities and providers in accordance with
the reporting and compliance requirements of the program.  Each assessed entity
shall report its number of child and adult covered lives according to a
schedule determined by the director and respond to any requests by the director
related to covered lives or assessments due.  Any assessed entity that fails to
respond to an audit request within ten business days of the receipt of
notification of audit request shall be responsible for prompt payment of fees
of any outside auditor engaged by the department to determine the information
and shall make all records requested by the department-engaged auditors
available for inspection and copying at the location within the State as
specified by the auditor.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Each provider administering immunizations
in the State that are supplied via federal vaccination programs or the program
shall report to the Hawaii immunization registry pursuant to section 325-122 any
data related to immunizations as the department determines is necessary for
disease prevention, control, and immunization inventory management and
accountability purposes.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Failure to cure non-compliance with any
reporting, auditing, or assessment obligation to the department no later than
thirty days from the postmarked date of written notice of noncompliance may
subject the assessed entity to fines, fees, and other costs of enforcement
established pursuant to subsection (d).  Any monetary fine, fee, or cost reimbursement
shall be remitted to the universal immunization purchase special fund.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Any entity that violates this part shall
be fined not more than $1,000 for each separate offense.  Each day of violation
shall constitute a separate offense.  The assessed entity shall also pay for
reasonable attorneys' fees and any other costs of enforcement under this
section.  Any action taken to impose or collect the penalty provided for in
this subsection shall be considered a civil action.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §325-&nbsp;&nbsp;  Immunity.</b>  Apart from
liabilities of assessed entities pursuant to this part, there shall be no
liability on the part of and no cause of action against the department, its
independent contractors, or its employees for any action or omission in the
course of operating the universal immunization purchase program.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §325-&nbsp;&nbsp;  Rulemaking.</b>  The
department may adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to carry out the purposes of
this part.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §325-&nbsp;&nbsp;   Available choices.</b>  The
department shall purchase immunizations through the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention contracted price list, or other group purchasing
negotiated discount rate, for which costs are funded pursuant to this part. 
The department may make purchases from available immunizations based on health
care provider requests and shall not limit the immunizations the department
purchases from those available at a discounted rate; provided that the
department may choose to not purchase a specific immunization that has a low
volume of statewide health care provider requests.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §325-&nbsp;&nbsp;  Immunization cost
reimbursement to providers; limits.</b>  This part shall have no impact on
amounts paid to providers to administer immunizations.  No provider may bill
any assessed entity or any other person for any immunizations supplied at no
cost by the State.&quot;</p>
