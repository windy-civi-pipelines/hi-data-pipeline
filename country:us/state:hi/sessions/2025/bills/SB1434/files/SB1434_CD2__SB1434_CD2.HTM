Section 1:
THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1434 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 1 C.D. 2 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO UNIVERSAL IMMUNIZATION FUNDING PROGRAM. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that fourteen states have adopted programs known as "Universal Purchase" or "Universal Select" (collectively, UP), which provide state-purchased access to some or all recommended immunizations to children and adults in those states.  UP immunization purchases occur at a discounted price through contracts otherwise intended for more established and familiar immunization purchasing programs such as the Vaccines For Children Program (Public Law 103-66) and Public Health Services Act, Section 317 Immunization Program (Public Law 78-410).  Other varied state approaches include superseding private sources of coverage and assessing health insurance plans for the cost of the program and disallowing provider use of private immunization stock. The legislature further finds that states with UP programs that allow state health officials to manage the supply of immunizations lowered health care providers' administrative costs and ensured that the states can quickly supply immunizations to vulnerable patient groups during emergencies or immunization shortages.  The potential benefits to Hawaii's health care and public health system make investment in a UP program worthwhile. The purpose of this Act is to establish a universal immunization funding program in the State. SECTION 2.  Chapter 325, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "PART .  UNIVERSAL IMMUNIZATION FUNDING PROGRAM §325-    Definitions.  As used in this part: "Adult covered lives" means all adults under the age of sixty-five who have immunizations covered: (1)  By an individual or group health insurance policy, plan, contract, or agreement issued or delivered in the State; (2)  By a group health insurance policy evidenced by a certificate of insurance issued or delivered to an individual residing in the State; (3)  By an employee benefit plan of a self-insured entity or a government plan for any employer or government entity that has an office or other worksite located in the State or has two or more employees; or (4)  As a participant or beneficiary of a health cost sharing program.
