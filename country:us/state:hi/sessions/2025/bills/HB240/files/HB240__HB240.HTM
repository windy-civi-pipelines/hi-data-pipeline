HB240 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 240 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to overdose prevention. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that drug overdose deaths are increasing in Hawaii, despite being preventable.  According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System, five hundred sixty-two people died of unintentional drug overdoses between mid-2020 and late 2022 in Hawaii. In 2023, there were three hundred sixty-four fatal drug overdoses in the State, of which forty per cent were due to opioids. The legislature further finds that overdose prevention centers are places where people can safely use drugs and receive harm reduction services and authorized objects.  These centers have operated in Europe, Canada, and Australia for over twenty years, with no overdose deaths being reported in the centers.  According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, overdose prevention centers are associated with significant reductions in many negative outcomes related to drug use, including public drug use, sharing of drug paraphernalia, soft tissue injuries, ambulance calls, emergency department visits, and crime. The legislature additionally finds that overdose prevention centers have recently been authorized in Michigan, Rhode Island, and Vermont and in New York City. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Establish criteria for the designation of overdose prevention centers to prevent drug overdose and death, prevent transmission of bloodborne pathogens, reduce public drug use, and link persons who use drugs with health and social services; and (2)  Provide immunity from state criminal prosecution for persons using a designated overdose prevention center and persons operating a designated overdose prevention center. SECTION 2.  The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Chapter overdose prevention centers §   -1  Definitions.  As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires: "Authorized objects" means objects authorized by the department, by rule, for dissemination to participants for the purpose of reducing infection or injury including but not limited to sterile injection equipment and supplies.
