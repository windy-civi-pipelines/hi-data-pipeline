THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
A BILL FORAN ACT
RELATING TO THE INTERSTATE MEDICAL LICENSURE COMPACT.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that it is necessary to
2 authorize the Hawaii medical board to conduct criminal history
3 record checks to fully comply with the statutes, rules,
4 policies, and bylaws of the Interstate Medical Licensure
5 Compact. This authorization will enable Hawaii to participate
6 as a state of principal license in the compact. Without the
7 designation as a state of principal license, physicians licensed
8 in Hawaii who are otherwise eligible and seeking to participate
9 in the compact would need to apply for compact licensure through
10 other states serving as their states of principal license.
11 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to authorize the
12 Hawaii medical board to perform criminal history record checks,
13 thereby allowing the Hawaii medical board to fully comply with
14 the statute, rules, policies, and bylaws of the Interstate
15 Medical Licensure Compact as a state of principal license.
16 SECTION 2. Section 846-2.7, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
17 amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows:

Aloha President Kouchi, Speaker Nakamura, and Members of the Legislature:
This is to inform you that on June 3, 2025, the following bill was signed into law:
S.B. NO. 1365, H.D. 1, RELATING TO THE INTERSTATE MEDICAL
C.D. 1 LICENSURE COMPACT.
ACT 163

THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
A BILL FORAN ACT
RELATING TO THE INTERSTATE MEDICAL LICENSURE COMPACT.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that it is necessary to
2 authorize the Hawaii medical board to conduct criminal history
3 record checks to fully comply with the statutes, rules,
4 policies, and bylaws of the Interstate Medical Licensure
5 Compact. This authorization will enable Hawaii to participate
6 as a state of principal license in the compact. Without the
7 designation as a state of principal license, physicians licensed
8 in Hawaii who are otherwise eligible and seeking to participate
9 in the compact would need to apply for compact licensure through
10 other states serving as their states of principal license.
11 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to authorize the
12 Hawaii medical board to perform criminal history record checks,
13 thereby allowing the Hawaii medical board to fully comply with
14 the statute, rules, policies, and bylaws of the Interstate
15 Medical Licensure Compact as a state of principal license.
16 SECTION 2. Section 846-2.7, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
17 amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows:
