A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO MAMAKI TEA.

1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that mamaki (Pipturus
2 albidus) is a plant that is endemic to the Hawaiian islands,
3 meaning that the Hawaiian islands are' the only place in the
4 world where mamaki grows naturally. Mamaki is found across the
5 entire Hawaiian island chain from the island of Kauai to the
6 island of Hawaii and flourishes at elevations between four
7 hundred feet and six thousand feet.
8 The legislature further finds that mamaki tea is a growing
9 agricultural commodity and believes that the implementation of
10 labeling requirements would ensure the viability of Hawaii-grown
11 mamaki tea.
12 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to protect
13 Hawaii-grown mamaki tea by:
14 (1) Prohibiting the use of certain words and misleading
15 Hawaiian imagery, place names, and motifs on the label
16 of a consumer package that contains or includes tea or
17 dried leaves from the plant Pipturus albidus, unless

3 (2) Appropriating funds for one staff position for the
4 department of agriculture to support enforcement of
5 labeling regulations.
6 SECTION 2. Chapter 486, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
7 amended by adding a new section to part V to be appropriately
8 designated and to read as follows:
9 "§486- Mamaki tea; labeling requirements. (a) No
10 label on a consumer package that contains or includes tea or
11 dried leaves from the plant Pipturus albidus shall contain:
12 (1) The words "Mamaki", "Hawaii", or "Hawaiian", or any
13 variation of these terms; or
14 (2) Misleading Hawaiian imagery, place names, or motifs,
15 unless one hundred per cent of the tea or dried leaves were
16 Hawaii-grown.
17 (b) Any nonconsumer package that contains tea or dried
18 leaves from the plant Pipturus albidus grown in the State and
19 introduced into intrastate or interstate commerce shall bear on
20 the package a label stating that the package contains
21 Hawaii-grown mamaki tea by using the words "Hawaii-grown mamaki

5 plant Pipturus albidus subject to and labeled in accordance with
6 subsection (a) shall make available to the administrator, upon
7 demand, documented proof that the tea or dried leaves were
8 Hawaii-grown.
9 (d) The department may establish and administer a
10 voluntary certification mark program for purposes of compliance
11 under this section.
12 (e) Any person or the department may sue for injunctive
13 relief to compel compliance with this section.
14 (f) Any person who violates this section shall be subject
15 to penalties under section 486-32.
16 (g) For the purposes of this section:
17 "Consumer package" has the same meaning as in section 486-
18 1.

20 and dried within the State of Hawaii.
