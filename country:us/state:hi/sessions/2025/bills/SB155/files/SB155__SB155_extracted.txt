Section 1:
SB155 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 155 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to evictions. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that nearly forty per cent of Hawaii households are renters.  Currently, renters can lose their housing through arbitrary non-renewals of their leases, even if they are tenants in good standing.  These arbitrary no-cause evictions disrupt the lives of tenants and contribute to financial insecurity and housing instability.  The fear of retaliatory no-cause evictions can also deter tenants from advocating for repairs and addressing habitability issues. The legislature further finds that preventing housing insecurity and displacement for local families requires that tenants be protected from arbitrary displacement. Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Prohibit landlords from terminating certain tenancies without cause; (2)  Establish criteria under which landlords can undertake a no-fault eviction; and (3)  Require landlords, when proceeding with a no-fault eviction, to offer relocation assistance to the tenant or waiver of the final month's rent. SECTION 2.  Chapter 521, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part    .  CAUSE FOR EVICTION; NO-FAULT EVICTIONS §521-A  Definitions.  As used in this part: "No-fault eviction" means an action for summary possession brought by a landlord that does not constitute cause under section 521-B(b).
