HR52 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.R. NO. 52 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII HOUSE RESOLUTION requesting the judiciary to assess the impact of increasing the level of the offense of harassment by stalking from a misdemeanor to a class c felony. WHEREAS, stalking is a serious crime that can have devastating, long-term impacts on victims of stalking, particularly in the context of domestic violence, where it is often used by perpetrators as a continuation of the abuse and as a calculated tactic meant to assert control, instill fear, and violate the autonomy of their victims; and WHEREAS, stalking is often a precursor to more severe, violent crimes, making its recognition and intervention essential for victim safety; and WHEREAS, treating stalking as a serious offense is vital to protect vulnerable persons and foster a culture that prioritizes the safety and well-being of victims; and WHEREAS, existing law classifies harassment by stalking as a misdemeanor offense; and WHEREAS, the offense of harassment by stalking requires establishing an ongoing course of conduct by the offender, which can require more investigative work to build a provable case than that required for other misdemeanor offenses; and WHEREAS, increasing the level of the offense of harassment by stalking to a Class C felony may help ensure stalking by harassment cases receive appropriate attention and resources, deter offenders, and reassure victims; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, that the Judiciary is requested to assess the impact of increasing the level of the offense of harassment by stalking from a misdemeanor to a Class C felony; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Judiciary is requested to submit a report of its findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, to the Legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2026; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a certified copy of this Resolution be transmitted to the Chief Justice of the Hawaii Supreme Court.
