C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO GUARDIANSHIP AND CONSERVATORSHIP SERVICES.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAW AH:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that since 2023, a
2 working group has been formed to identify and address issues in
3 the State's guardianship and conservatorship statutory
4 procedures. This working group is named the "uniform
5 guardianship, conservatorship, and other protective arrangements
6 act working group", and it has met regularly in 2024 under the
7 facilitation of the staff of the Hawaii state council on
8 developmental disabilities. An important issue identified by
9 the working group is the accessibility of certain resources that
10 the court may order for individuals, also statutorily referred
11 to as respondents, for whom a guardianship or conservatorship is
12 being sought. The specific services are "kokua kanawai", who
13 are individuals appointed by the court to review the personal
14 circumstances of the respondent and provide the court with an
15 independent assessment of the situation; guardians ad litem, who
16 are individuals appointed by the court to represent the best
17 interests of the respondent; and "professional evaluations",

1 including but not limited to a psychological evaluation,
2 neurocognitive evaluation, or functional evaluation, by a
3 physician, psychologist, or other individual appointed by the
4 court who is qualified to evaluate the respondent's alleged
5 impairment.
6 While the court has the statutory authority to order these
7 resources, it does not always order them. The information
8 provided by these resources supplies the court with essential
9 information to support a court's informed decisions regarding
10 the capacity and circumstances of respondents. Overall, they
11 make the procedures surrounding guardianship and conservatorship
12 more equitable. When respondents do not receive these
13 resources, it is usually because they do not have the personal
14 finances to afford them.
15 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish a two-
16 year guardianship- and conservatorship-related court resources
17 pilot program in the circuit court of the first circuit that
18 will ensure these resources are available to all respondents.
19 SECTION 2. (a) There shall be established within the
20 judiciary a two-year pilot program in the probate court and
21 family court of the first circuit to fund the following

1 guardianship- and conservatorship-related court resources in

5 (1) An investigation and report by a kokua kanawai
6 appointed with the powers and duties pursuant to

8 for guardianships and powers and duties pursuant to
9 section 560:5-406 (c) and (d), Hawaii Revised Statutes,
10 for conservatorships;
11 (2) A guardian ad litem appointed pursuant to section
12 560:5-115, Hawaii Revised Statutes; and
13 (3) A professional evaluation of the respondent's alleged
14 impairment pursuant to section 560:5-306, Hawaii
15 Revised Statutes, for guardianships or section
16 560:5-406(f), Hawaii Revised Statutes, for
17 conservatorships, that includes information as noted
18 in rule 102, Hawaii probate rules; provided that the
19 professional evaluation may include but not be limited
20 to a psychological evaluation, neurocognitive
21 evaluation, or functional evaluation.
