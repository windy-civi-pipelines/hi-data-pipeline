Section 1:
SB1323 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1323 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO HEALTH CARE. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  In 1999, the legislature passed the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act (1993), which was enacted and codified as chapter 327E, Hawaii Revised Statutes, and in 2004, passed an advance mental health care directives law, which was enacted and codified as chapter 327G, Hawaii Revised Statutes. The legislature finds that these laws should be updated and consolidated into one unified law regarding health-care decisions to avoid confusion and conflicting provisions.  In 2023, the Uniform Law Commission approved and recommended for enactment in all states the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act (2023).  While existing Hawaii law addresses advance directives broadly, the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act (2023) does so more comprehensively by dividing various types of advance directives into separate sections for power of attorney for health care, health-care instructions, and advance mental health-care directives. Among other things, the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act (2023) expands upon the framework for determining whether an individual has capacity, removes legal hurdles for creating advance directives, addresses both advance health-care directives and advance mental health-care directives within the same statutory framework, and allows an individual to assent to a "Ulysses clause" in an advance mental health-care directive, which allows an individual to include an instruction that prevents the individual from revoking the advance directive if the individual is experiencing a psychiatric or psychological event specified in the directive. Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to update laws concerning advance health-care directives and advance mental health-care directives by adopting the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act (2023) in amended form. SECTION 2.  The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "CHAPTER HEALTH-CARE DECISIONS §   -1  Short title.  This chapter may be cited as the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act (modified). §   -2  Definitions.  As used in this chapter, unless the context clearly requires otherwise: "Advance health-care directive" means a power of attorney for health care, health-care instruction, or both.  The term includes an advance mental health-care directive.

The person selected to act as the individual's default surrogate shall be the person who has a close relationship with the individual and who is the most likely to be currently informed of the individual's wishes regarding health-care decisions. (e)  If any of the interested persons disagrees with the selection of the default surrogate or the health-care decision by the default surrogate, or, if after reasonable efforts the interested persons are unable to reach a consensus as to who should act as the default surrogate, any of the interested persons may seek guardianship of the individual by initiating guardianship proceedings pursuant to chapter 551 or chapter 560, as applicable.  Only interested persons involved in the discussions to choose a default surrogate may initiate such proceedings with regard to the individual. (f)  A responsible health-care professional may require a person who assumes authority to act as a default surrogate to provide a signed declaration in a record under penalty of law stating facts and circumstances reasonably sufficient to establish the authority.  The signed declaration shall include the following: (1)  The name of the person who seeks to assume the authority to act as a default surrogate; (2)  An affirmation that the person understands that the statements and affirmations are made under the penalty of law; (3)  An affirmation that the person had a relationship with the individual who lacks capacity prior to the individual becoming incapacitated; (4)  A statement defining that relationship, including identifying the relationship of the person to the individual; (5)  If the person is not a family member or cohabitant, a statement describing how the person exhibited special care and concern for the individual who lacks capacity and is familiar with the individual's personal values; and (6)  Affirmation that the person understands that the health-care professional will reasonably rely on the person's representations in the declaration to assist in providing medical treatment. (g)  If a responsible health-care professional reasonably determines that a person who assumed authority to act as a default surrogate is not willing or able to comply with a duty under section    -17 or fails to comply with the duty in a timely manner, the professional may request interested persons to choose another default surrogate. (h)  A health-care decision made by a default surrogate shall be effective without judicial approval.

(b)  A person shall be disqualified from acting as a default surrogate for an individual who lacks capacity to make health-care decisions if: (1)  A court finds that the potential default surrogate poses a danger to the individual's well-being, even if the court does not issue a restraining order or injunction against the potential surrogate; (2)  The potential default surrogate is an owner, operator, employee, or contractor of a nursing home or other residential care facility in which the individual is residing or receiving care unless the owner, operator, employee, or contractor is a family member of the individual, the cohabitant of the individual, or a family member of the cohabitant; (3)  The potential default surrogate refuses to provide a timely declaration under section    -12(f) upon the request by a responsible health-care professional; or (4)  The potential default surrogate is the individual's spouse or civil union partner, and: (A)  A petition for annulment, divorce, or dissolution of marriage, legal separation, or termination has been filed and not dismissed or withdrawn; or (B)  A decree of annulment, divorce, or dissolution of marriage, legal separation, or termination has been issued, the individual and the spouse or civil union partner have agreed in a record to a legal separation; or (C)  The spouse or  civil union partner has abandoned or deserted the individual for more than one year. (c)  Notwithstanding subsection (b)(4), a spouse or civil union partner shall not be disqualified if the individual has retained capacity under section    -3(a)(1) and (2)(C) and expresses the wish not to disqualify the spouse or civil union partner as a default surrogate. §   -14  Revocation.  (a)  An individual may revoke the appointment of an agent, the designation of a default surrogate, or a health-care instruction in whole or in part, unless: (1)  A court finds the individual lacks capacity to do so; (2)  The individual is found under section   -4(b) to lack capacity to do so and, if the individual objects to the finding, the finding is confirmed under section    -5(d)(4); or (3)  The individual created an advance mental health-care directive that includes the provision under section    -9(d) and the individual is experiencing the psychiatric or psychological event specified in the directive.

(c)  An advance health-care directive, revocation of a directive, or a signature on a directive or revocation shall not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form. (d)  Evidence relating to an advance health-care directive, revocation of a directive, or a signature on a directive or revocation shall not be excluded in a proceeding solely because the evidence is in electronic form.

A default surrogate may act as a medicaid authorized representative, pursuant to federal and state medicaid laws relating to authorized representatives, on the individual's behalf for the purposes of medicaid, including assisting with, submitting, and executing a medicaid application, redetermination of eligibility, or other on-going medicaid-related communications with the department of human services.  For the purposes of medicaid, the default surrogate may access medicaid records of the individual on whose behalf the default surrogate is designated to act.  For a default surrogate to be able to act under this subsection, the default surrogate shall agree to be legally bound by the federal and state authorities related to authorized representatives, including maintaining the confidentiality of any information provided by the department of human services, in compliance with all state and federal confidentiality laws. The agent of default surrogate's status as an authorized representative for the purposes of medicaid shall terminate when revoked by an individual who no longer lacks capacity, upon appointment or availability of another agent or guardian, or upon the individual's death. (e)  An agent or default surrogate shall not consent to voluntary admission of the individual to a facility for mental health treatment unless: (1)  Voluntary admission is specifically authorized by the individual in an advance health-care directive in a record; and (2)  The admission is for no more than the maximum of the number of days specified in the directive or thirty days, whichever is less. (f)  An agent or default surrogate may consent to placement of the individual in a nursing home without specific authorization by the individual; provided that if the placement is intended to be for more than one hundred days an agent or default surrogate shall not consent to placement of the individual in a nursing home if: (1)  An alternative living arrangement is reasonably feasible; (2)  The individual objects to the placement; or (3)  The individual is not terminally ill. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent an agent or default surrogate from consenting to placement of the individual in a nursing home for more than one hundred days if the individual specifically authorizes the agent or default surrogate to do so in an advance health-care directive in a record. §   -19  Limitation on powers.  (a)  If an individual has a long-term disability requiring routine treatment by artificial nutrition, hydration, or mechanical ventilation and a history of using the treatment without objection, an agent or default surrogate shall not consent to withhold or withdraw the treatment unless: (1)  The treatment is not necessary to sustain the individual's life or maintain the individual's well-being; (2)  The individual has expressly authorized the withholding or withdrawal in a health-care instruction that has not been revoked; or (3)  The individual has experienced a major reduction in health or functional ability from which the individual is not expected to recover, even with other appropriate treatment, and the individual has not: (A)  Given a direction inconsistent with withholding or withdrawal; or (B)  Communicated by verbal or nonverbal expression a desire for artificial nutrition, hydration, or mechanical ventilation. (b)  A default surrogate shall not make a health-care decision if, under other laws of this State, the decision: (1)  May not be made by a guardian; or (2)  May be made by a guardian only if the court appointing the guardian specifically authorizes the guardian to make the decision. §   -20  Co-agents; alternate agent.  (a)  An individual may appoint multiple individuals as co-agents in a power of attorney for health care.  Unless the power of attorney provides otherwise, each co-agent may exercise independent authority. (b)  An individual in a power of attorney for health care may appoint one or more individuals to act as alternate agents if a predecessor agent withdraws, dies, becomes disqualified, is not reasonably available, or otherwise is unwilling or unable to act as agent. (c)  Unless the power of attorney provides otherwise, an alternate agent shall have the same authority as the original agent: (1)  At any time the original agent is not reasonably available or is otherwise unwilling or unable to act, for the duration of the unavailability, unwillingness, or inability to act; or (2)  If the original agent and all other predecessor agents have withdrawn, died, or are disqualified from acting as agent. §   -21  Duties of health-care professional, responsible health-care professional, and health-care institution.  (a)  A responsible health-care professional who is aware that an individual has been found under section    -4(b) or by a court to lack capacity to make a health-care decision shall make a reasonable effort to determine if the individual has a surrogate. (b)  If possible before implementing a health-care decision made by a surrogate, a responsible health-care professional as soon as reasonably feasible shall communicate to the individual the decision made and the identity of the surrogate. (c)  A responsible health-care professional who makes or is informed of a finding that an individual lacks capacity to make a health-care decision or no longer lacks capacity, or that other circumstances exist that affect a health-care instruction or the authority of a surrogate, as soon as reasonably feasible, shall: (1)  Document the finding or circumstance in the individual's medical record; and (2)  If possible, communicate to the individual and the individual's surrogate the finding or circumstance and that the individual may object under section -5(c) to the finding under section -4(b). (d)  A responsible health-care professional who is informed that an individual has created or revoked an advance health-care directive, or that a surrogate for an individual has been appointed, designated, or disqualified, or has withdrawn, shall: (1)  Document the information as soon as reasonably feasible in the individual's medical record; and (2)  If evidence of the directive, revocation, appointment, designation, disqualification, or withdrawal is in a record, request a copy and, on receipt, cause the copy to be included in the individual's medical record. (e)  Except as provided in subsections (f) and (g), a health-care professional or health-care institution providing health care to an individual shall comply with: (1)  A health-care instruction given by the individual regarding the individual's health care; (2)  A reasonable interpretation by the individual's surrogate of an instruction given by the individual; and (3)  A health-care decision for the individual made by the individual's surrogate in accordance with sections    -17 and -18 to the same extent as if the decision had been made by the individual at a time when the individual had capacity. (f)  A health-care professional or a health-care institution may refuse to provide health care consistent with a health-care instruction or health-care decision if: (1)  The instruction or decision is contrary to a policy of the health-care institution providing care to the individual and the policy was timely communicated to the individual with capacity or to the individual's surrogate; (2)  The care would require health care that is not available to the professional or institution; or (3)  Compliance with the instruction or decision would: (A)  Require the professional to provide care that is contrary to the professional's religious belief or moral conviction and if other law permits the professional to refuse to provide care for that reason; (B)  Require the professional or institution to provide care that is contrary to generally accepted health-care standards applicable to the professional or institution; or (C)  Violate a court order or other law. (g)  A health-care professional or health-care institution that refuses to provide care under subsection (f) shall: (1)  As soon as reasonably feasible, inform the individual, if possible, and the individual's surrogate of the refusal; and (2)  Immediately make a reasonable effort to transfer the individual to another health-care professional or health-care institution that is willing to comply with the instruction or decision and provide life-sustaining care and care needed to keep or make the individual comfortable, consistent with accepted medical standards to the extent feasible, until a transfer is made. §   -22  Decision by guardian.  (a)  A guardian may refuse to comply with or revoke the individual's advance health-care directive only if the court appointing the guardian expressly orders the noncompliance or revocation. (b)  Unless a court orders otherwise, a health-care decision made by an agent appointed by an individual subject to guardianship prevails over a decision of the guardian appointed for the individual. §   -23  Immunity.  (a)  A health-care professional or health-care institution acting in good faith shall not be subject to civil or criminal liability or to discipline for unprofessional conduct for: (1)  Complying with a health-care decision made for an individual by another person if compliance is based on a reasonable belief that the person has authority to make the decision, including a decision to withhold or withdraw health care; (2)  Refusing to comply with a health-care decision made for an individual by another person if the refusal is based on a reasonable belief that the person lacked authority or capacity to make the decision; (3)  Complying with an advance health-care directive based on a reasonable belief that the directive is valid; (4)  Refusing to comply with an advance health-care directive based on a reasonable belief that the directive is not valid, including a reasonable belief that the directive was not made by the individual or, after its creation, was substantively altered by a person other than the individual who created it; (5)  Determining that a person who otherwise might be authorized to act as an agent or default surrogate is not reasonably available; or (6)  Complying with an individual's direction under section    -9(d). (b)  An agent, default surrogate, or person with a reasonable belief that the person is an agent or a default surrogate shall not be subject to civil or criminal liability or to discipline for unprofessional conduct for a health-care decision made in a good faith effort to comply with section   -17. §   -24  Prohibited conduct; damages.  (a)  A person shall not: (1)  Intentionally falsify, in whole or in part, an advance health-care directive; (2)  For the purpose of frustrating the intent of the individual who created an advance health-care directive or with knowledge that doing so is likely to frustrate the intent: (A)  Intentionally conceal, deface, obliterate, or delete the directive or a revocation of the directive without consent of the individual who created or revoked the directive; or (B)  Intentionally withhold knowledge of the existence or revocation of the directive from a responsible health-care professional or health-care institution providing health care to the individual who created or revoked the directive; (3)  Coerce or fraudulently induce an individual to create, revoke, or refrain from creating or revoking an advance health-care directive or a part of a directive; or (4)  Require or prohibit the creation or revocation of an advance health-care directive as a condition for providing health care.

Raw Text:
SB1323 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1323 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO HEALTH CARE. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  In 1999, the legislature passed the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act (1993), which was enacted and codified as chapter 327E, Hawaii Revised Statutes, and in 2004, passed an advance mental health care directives law, which was enacted and codified as chapter 327G, Hawaii Revised Statutes. The legislature finds that these laws should be updated and consolidated into one unified law regarding health-care decisions to avoid confusion and conflicting provisions.  In 2023, the Uniform Law Commission approved and recommended for enactment in all states the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act (2023).  While existing Hawaii law addresses advance directives broadly, the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act (2023) does so more comprehensively by dividing various types of advance directives into separate sections for power of attorney for health care, health-care instructions, and advance mental health-care directives. Among other things, the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act (2023) expands upon the framework for determining whether an individual has capacity, removes legal hurdles for creating advance directives, addresses both advance health-care directives and advance mental health-care directives within the same statutory framework, and allows an individual to assent to a "Ulysses clause" in an advance mental health-care directive, which allows an individual to include an instruction that prevents the individual from revoking the advance directive if the individual is experiencing a psychiatric or psychological event specified in the directive. Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to update laws concerning advance health-care directives and advance mental health-care directives by adopting the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act (2023) in amended form. SECTION 2.  The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "CHAPTER HEALTH-CARE DECISIONS §   -1  Short title.  This chapter may be cited as the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act (modified). §   -2  Definitions.  As used in this chapter, unless the context clearly requires otherwise: "Advance health-care directive" means a power of attorney for health care, health-care instruction, or both.  The term includes an advance mental health-care directive.

(b)  A person may assume without inquiry that an advance health-care directive is genuine, valid, and still in effect, and may implement and rely on it, unless the person has good cause to believe the directive is invalid or has been revoked. (c)  An advance health-care directive, revocation of a directive, or a signature on a directive or revocation shall not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form. (d)  Evidence relating to an advance health-care directive, revocation of a directive, or a signature on a directive or revocation shall not be excluded in a proceeding solely because the evidence is in electronic form.

A default surrogate may act as a medicaid authorized representative, pursuant to federal and state medicaid laws relating to authorized representatives, on the individual's behalf for the purposes of medicaid, including assisting with, submitting, and executing a medicaid application, redetermination of eligibility, or other on-going medicaid-related communications with the department of human services.  For the purposes of medicaid, the default surrogate may access medicaid records of the individual on whose behalf the default surrogate is designated to act.  For a default surrogate to be able to act under this subsection, the default surrogate shall agree to be legally bound by the federal and state authorities related to authorized representatives, including maintaining the confidentiality of any information provided by the department of human services, in compliance with all state and federal confidentiality laws.
