‘ A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the federal funding
2 freeze imposed by the United States Office of Management and
3 Budget may have detrimental effects on Hawaii's nonprofit
4 sector, which provides critical services in health and human
5 services. Without assistance from the federal government,
6 Hawaii's federally qualified health centers, and programs that
7 provide child care, social services, subsidized housing, and
8 homeless services, will see a significant drop in funding.
9 The purpose of this Act is to appropriate moneys to and
10 authorize temporary full-time equivalent positions for the
11 office of community services of the department of labor and
12 industrial relations to award grants subject to chapter 42F,
13 Hawaii Revised Statutes, and other qualifications, for fiscal
14 year 2025-2026, and authorize the office of community services
15 to contract the services of Aloha United Way, Inc., to assist
16 with the administration and distribution of grant awards.
