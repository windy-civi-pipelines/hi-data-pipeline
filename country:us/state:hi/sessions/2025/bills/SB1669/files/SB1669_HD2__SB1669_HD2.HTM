SB1669 HD2 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1669 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 2 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the best proven models of successful, affordable, healthy, and vibrant communities in transit-oriented development areas require sufficient water, sewer, and power infrastructure; significant affordable housing; safe, comfortable, and convenient pedestrian and multi-modal transit connectivity; meaningful community amenities such as parks, recreational facilities, and event venues; and community programs that provide for culture, arts, communication, safety, security, and cleanliness. The legislature further finds that while significant effort has been made to plan for and prioritize affordable housing in transit-oriented development areas, too often the rest of the community infrastructure, multi-modal connectivity, public spaces, and amenities required for successful, livable communities are not the top priority for any one department or agency.  As a result, these are often not planned for or constructed, ending up an afterthought once people move in and discover the gaps in their quality of life.  This results in communities that are often sufficient for transient investment units and vacation properties, but not best suited for local families and permanent residents.  Inevitably, this leads to costly retrofits, inferior community amenities, and diminished quality of life. The legislature also finds that the two highest costs contributing to the cost of living are housing and transportation.  By broadening the State's focus to develop affordable communities with fully built community infrastructure and amenities, rather than just affordable housing, the cost of a single unit can be reduced by as much as $75,000, and the cost of transportation for families living there can be reduced by $15,000 or more per year. Units in many recent housing projects have become prohibitively expensive.  On average, about $50,000 is added to the cost of a unit per parking stall built for it, and as much as $25,000 per unit for building amenities.  Numerous cities have begun separating and aggregating parking stalls and building amenities, lowering the cost of each unit produced by as much as $75,000. The legislature further finds that building separate parking garages allows residents in an area to lease space or use a parking stall as may be needed, rather than having the cost forced upon them through their mortgage.  This is important considering Hawaii's next generation is driving considerably less than previous generations.  Since 2000, the percentage of eighteen- to twenty-nine-year-olds with a driver's license has plummeted nearly forty per cent. Many desire to live in walkable, bikeable communities where they can get around without the average costly expense of $10,000 per year for each additional car in a family. Additionally, relieving housing developers of the burden of building excessive amenities and gathering spaces in each building lowers the cost of living. Aggregating public spaces for open plazas, gathering spaces, parks, and green spaces available to everyone creates and fosters a better sense of community and opportunities for better mixed-use commercial, retail, and food options at a lower overall cost. The legislature believes that tasking an agency with a primary mission to prioritize, plan, and build community infrastructure and amenities such as parks, public spaces, markets, and other amenities that make communities livable, desirable, and lower the cost of living should be a priority, not an afterthought.  This approach, utilized by countless successful jurisdictions around the country and world, can reduce the cost of living, and, equally importantly, improve the quality of life and mental health and well-being for residents of all ages. The legislature additionally finds that incorporating mixed-use commercial and retail space into the ground floors of buildings not only puts daily needs within walking distance of residents, but also provides lease rent and revenue generating opportunities that can help pay for maintenance, security, and similar expenses to lower maintenance fees and cost of living for residents in each building by thousands of dollars per year. The legislature notes that some state agencies, such as the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation and Hawaii public housing authority, have a primary focus on building affordable communities, and other agencies, such as the Hawaii community development authority, have a broad focus on urban planning and development, but must compromise between achieving numerous goals, often leaving critical community amenities and infrastructure unfulfilled. Currently, no agency is tasked with a primary mission to plan for and construct the rest of the community infrastructure and amenities necessary to fill the gaps in recent development projects to ensure communities are being planned and built from the start with the public spaces, safe connectivity, and everything else the public tends to desire and need to reduce the cost of living, improve the quality of life, and ensure that affordable communities end up as more than transient investment or vacation properties, but rather as an ideal home for local residents to live, work, and play within. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish the transit-oriented community improvement partnership, with a primary focus on prioritizing and implementing the community improvements and amenities desired by local residents necessary for affordable, healthy, and vibrant communities.  The partnership shall: (1)  Coordinate with transit-oriented community development agencies and other stakeholders to ensure communities are planned and built with full transit infrastructure, communities, amenities, and workforce housing needed for success; (2)  Build community infrastructure, amenities, and address other needs to lower the cost of living and improve the quality of life; and (3)  Establish programs that communities desire, such as community and business improvement districts, to promote community engagement, keep public spaces safe and clean, and provide better opportunities and pathways for local economic development.

SB1669 HD2 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1669 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 2 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the best proven models of successful, affordable, healthy, and vibrant communities in transit-oriented development areas require sufficient water, sewer, and power infrastructure; significant affordable housing; safe, comfortable, and convenient pedestrian and multi-modal transit connectivity; meaningful community amenities such as parks, recreational facilities, and event venues; and community programs that provide for culture, arts, communication, safety, security, and cleanliness. The legislature further finds that while significant effort has been made to plan for and prioritize affordable housing in transit-oriented development areas, too often the rest of the community infrastructure, multi-modal connectivity, public spaces, and amenities required for successful, livable communities are not the top priority for any one department or agency.  As a result, these are often not planned for or constructed, ending up an afterthought once people move in and discover the gaps in their quality of life.  This results in communities that are often sufficient for transient investment units and vacation properties, but not best suited for local families and permanent residents.  Inevitably, this leads to costly retrofits, inferior community amenities, and diminished quality of life. The legislature also finds that the two highest costs contributing to the cost of living are housing and transportation.  By broadening the State's focus to develop affordable communities with fully built community infrastructure and amenities, rather than just affordable housing, the cost of a single unit can be reduced by as much as $75,000, and the cost of transportation for families living there can be reduced by $15,000 or more per year. Units in many recent housing projects have become prohibitively expensive.  On average, about $50,000 is added to the cost of a unit per parking stall built for it, and as much as $25,000 per unit for building amenities.  Numerous cities have begun separating and aggregating parking stalls and building amenities, lowering the cost of each unit produced by as much as $75,000. The legislature further finds that building separate parking garages allows residents in an area to lease space or use a parking stall as may be needed, rather than having the cost forced upon them through their mortgage.  This is important considering Hawaii's next generation is driving considerably less than previous generations.  Since 2000, the percentage of eighteen- to twenty-nine-year-olds with a driver's license has plummeted nearly forty per cent. Many desire to live in walkable, bikeable communities where they can get around without the average costly expense of $10,000 per year for each additional car in a family. Additionally, relieving housing developers of the burden of building excessive amenities and gathering spaces in each building lowers the cost of living. Aggregating public spaces for open plazas, gathering spaces, parks, and green spaces available to everyone creates and fosters a better sense of community and opportunities for better mixed-use commercial, retail, and food options at a lower overall cost. The legislature believes that tasking an agency with a primary mission to prioritize, plan, and build community infrastructure and amenities such as parks, public spaces, markets, and other amenities that make communities livable, desirable, and lower the cost of living should be a priority, not an afterthought.  This approach, utilized by countless successful jurisdictions around the country and world, can reduce the cost of living, and, equally importantly, improve the quality of life and mental health and well-being for residents of all ages. The legislature additionally finds that incorporating mixed-use commercial and retail space into the ground floors of buildings not only puts daily needs within walking distance of residents, but also provides lease rent and revenue generating opportunities that can help pay for maintenance, security, and similar expenses to lower maintenance fees and cost of living for residents in each building by thousands of dollars per year. The legislature notes that some state agencies, such as the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation and Hawaii public housing authority, have a primary focus on building affordable communities, and other agencies, such as the Hawaii community development authority, have a broad focus on urban planning and development, but must compromise between achieving numerous goals, often leaving critical community amenities and infrastructure unfulfilled. Currently, no agency is tasked with a primary mission to plan for and construct the rest of the community infrastructure and amenities necessary to fill the gaps in recent development projects to ensure communities are being planned and built from the start with the public spaces, safe connectivity, and everything else the public tends to desire and need to reduce the cost of living, improve the quality of life, and ensure that affordable communities end up as more than transient investment or vacation properties, but rather as an ideal home for local residents to live, work, and play within. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish the transit-oriented community improvement partnership, with a primary focus on prioritizing and implementing the community improvements and amenities desired by local residents necessary for affordable, healthy, and vibrant communities.  The partnership shall: (1)  Coordinate with transit-oriented community development agencies and other stakeholders to ensure communities are planned and built with full transit infrastructure, communities, amenities, and workforce housing needed for success; (2)  Build community infrastructure, amenities, and address other needs to lower the cost of living and improve the quality of life; and (3)  Establish programs that communities desire, such as community and business improvement districts, to promote community engagement, keep public spaces safe and clean, and provide better opportunities and pathways for local economic development.
