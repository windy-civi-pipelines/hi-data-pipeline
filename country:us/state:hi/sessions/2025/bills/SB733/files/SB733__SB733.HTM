SB733 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 733 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT PROPOSING AMENDMENTS TO THE HAWAII STATE CONSTITUTION TO ESTABLISH A CONTINUOUS LEGISLATIVE SESSION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii's state legislature is in session for only sixty session days per year, generally from the middle of January until early May. The legislature notes that the representatives and senators who comprise the state legislature are part-time employees of the State. The legislature further finds that the efficiency, productivity, and orderliness of the state legislature could be improved by requiring that the legislature be in session during every month of the year. The legislature notes that doing so would make the representatives and senators who comprise the state legislature full-time employees of the State.  The legislature also finds this change in the nature of legislators' employment status will warrant a reevaluation by the commission on salaries of legislative members' salaries. The purpose of this Act is to propose amendments to the Constitution of the State of Hawaii to establish a continuous legislative session, beginning in January 2029.  Specifically, this Act: (1)  Requires the legislature to convene at least once each month; (2)  Removes constitutional language regarding special sessions, adjournment, and recesses; (3)  Creates a two-year deadline for a bill to be submitted for gubernatorial consideration; (4)  Standardizes the number of days that the governor must approve or veto a bill submitted for consideration; (5)  Requires the passage of the legislative budget not later than forty-five days before the end of each fiscal year; (6)  Prohibits members of the legislature from holding any position of employment in the private sector during their term; (7)  Authorizes members of the legislature to serve in the United States military reserves, National Guard, or hold any lawful position of government employment, subject to certain current ethical limitations; and (8)  Establishes salaries of the members of the legislature pursuant to recommendations by the commission on salaries submitted during the 2028 regular session, unless those recommendations are amended by law. SECTION 2.  Article III, section 8, of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii is amended to read as follows: "DISQUALIFICATIONS OF MEMBERS Section 8.  No member of the legislature [shall hold any other public office under the State, nor shall the member], during the term for which the member is elected or appointed, shall hold any position of employment in the private sector. The member may serve in the United States military reserves, National Guard, or hold any lawful position of government employment; provided that the member shall not be elected or appointed to any public office or employment [which] that shall have been created, or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased, by legislative act during [such] the term.  The term "public offices," for the purposes of this section, shall not include notaries public, reserve police officers or officers of emergency organizations for civilian defense or disaster relief.  The legislature may prescribe further disqualifications." SECTION 3.  Article III, section 10, of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii is amended to read as follows: "[SESSIONS] MEETINGS Section 10.  The legislature shall convene annually [in regular session] at 10:00 o'clock a.m. on the third Wednesday in January.  The legislature shall convene at least once each month. [At the written request of two-thirds of the members to which each house is entitled, the presiding officers of both houses shall convene the legislature in special session.  At the written request of two-thirds of the members of the senate, the president of the senate shall convene the senate in special session for the purpose of carrying out its responsibility established by Section 3 of Article VI.  The governor may convene both houses or the senate alone in special session. Regular sessions shall be limited to a period of sixty days, and special sessions shall be limited to a period of thirty days.  Any session may be extended a total of not more than fifteen days. Such extension shall be granted by the presiding officers of both houses at the written request of two‑thirds of the members to which each house is entitled or may be granted by the governor. Each regular session shall be recessed for not less than five days at some period between the twentieth and fortieth days of the regular session.  The legislature shall determine the dates of the mandatory recess by concurrent resolution.  Any session may be recessed by concurrent resolution adopted by a majority of the members to which each house is entitled.  Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, the days in mandatory recess and any days in recess pursuant to a concurrent resolution shall be excluded in computing the number of days of any session.] All [sessions] meetings shall be held in the capital of the State.  In case the capital shall be unsafe, the governor may direct that any [session] meeting be held at some other place." SECTION 4.  Article III, section 12, of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii is amended to read as follows: "ORGANIZATION; DISCIPLINE; RULES; PROCEDURE Section 12.  Each house shall be the judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members and shall have, for misconduct, disorderly behavior or neglect of duty of any member, power to punish [such] the member by censure or, upon a two-thirds vote of all the members to which [such] the house is entitled, by suspension or expulsion of [such] the member.  Each house shall choose its own officers, determine the rules of its proceedings and keep a journal.  The ayes and noes of the members on any question shall, at the desire of one-fifth of the members present, be entered upon the journal.

Every bill when passed by the house in which it originated, or in which amendments thereto shall have originated, shall immediately be certified by the presiding officer and clerk and sent to the other house for consideration. Any bill pending at the final adjournment of a regular session in an odd-numbered year shall carry over with the same status to the next regular session. Before the carried-over bill is enacted, it shall pass at least one reading in the house in which the bill originated.  The general appropriations bill or the supplemental appropriations bill for the ensuing fiscal year, as the case may be, shall pass each house and be submitted for gubernatorial consideration not later than forty-five days before the end of the existing fiscal year.  If the last day of the period within which the bill is required to be submitted for gubernatorial consideration falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, the period shall extend to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or holiday."

The governor shall have [ten] ninety calendar days to consider bills presented [to the governor ten or more days before the adjournment of the legislature sine die], and if any [such] bill is neither signed nor returned by the governor within that time, it shall become law in like manner as if the governor had signed it.  If the last day of the period within which the bill presented is required to be signed or returned falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, the period shall extend to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or holiday.
