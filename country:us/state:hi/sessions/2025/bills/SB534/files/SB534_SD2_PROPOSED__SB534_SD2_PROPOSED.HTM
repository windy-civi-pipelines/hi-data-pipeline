<p class=RegularParagraphs align=center style='text-align:center'><a
name="_Hlk114575812">PART I</a></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the
office of Hawaiian affairs was established under article XII, section 5, of the
Hawaii State Constitution to &quot;hold title to all the real and personal
property now or hereafter set aside or conveyed to it which shall be held in
trust for native Hawaiians and Hawaiians.&quot;  The office of Hawaiian
affairs' board of trustees is authorized by article XII, section 6, of the
Hawaii State Constitution &quot;to manage and administer the proceeds from the
sale or other disposition of the lands . . . and income derived from whatever sources
for native Hawaiians and Hawaiians, including all income and proceeds from that
pro rata portion of the trust referred to in section 4 of this article [the
public land trust] for native Hawaiians.&quot;  The board of trustees is also
authorized under article XII, section 6, &quot;to exercise control over real
and personal property set aside by state, federal or private sources and
transferred to the board for native Hawaiians and Hawaiians.&quot;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     In section 1 of Act 15, Session Laws of Hawaii
2012 (Act&nbsp;15), the legislature found that a purpose of the Act was to:</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>[E]ffectively
and responsibly fulfill the constitutional obligation to native Hawaiians under
article XII, sections 4 and 6, of the State Constitution between November 7,
1978, up to and including June 30, 2012 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and providing
additional resources to the office in the form of fee simple title to certain
parcels of land[.]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>In the same section of Act 15, the legislature
declared that the &quot;[c]onveyance of the fee simple interest to the lands .
. . will allow the State to effectively and responsibly meet [those]
constitutional obligations to native Hawaiians.&quot;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Further, section 2 of Act 15 stated, &quot;the
fee simple interest to the . . . parcels of land . . . is conveyed to the
office of Hawaiian affairs as grantee, as of July 1, 2012, as is, where
is[.]&quot;  In the same section of Act 15, however, the legislature
specifically directed that, &quot;[t]he [properties] are and shall remain (even
after conveyance to the office) under the jurisdiction and authority of the
Hawaii community development authority, with respect to zoning, land use
conditions[,] and all other matters over which the authority has jurisdiction
and authority to act&quot; and &quot;shall be subject to all laws, except
sections 206E-8, 206E-10, 206E&#8209;34, Hawaii Revised Statutes, and otherwise
provided in this Act.&quot;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Particularly pertinent to the purpose of Act
15, in section&nbsp;6, the legislature further declared that:</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>The [p]roperties
conveyed by this Act shall be deemed income and proceeds from the public land
trust, as if the [p]roperties had been paid out of the income and proceeds from
the public land trust pursuant to article&nbsp;XII, section 6 of the Hawaii
State Constitution.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Relying on its board of trustees' authority to
&quot;exercise control&quot; over lands that the office of Hawaiian affairs
holds in trust for native Hawaiians and to &quot;manage and administer&quot;
the income and proceeds from the public land trust lands it receives, the
office of Hawaiian affairs has asked the legislature to enact this Act to allow
the office of Hawaiian affairs to maximize the income or proceeds that certain
parcels of land conveyed by Act 15 could generate for the purposes of bettering
the conditions of native Hawaiians, by allowing the parcels to be developed for
residential use.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature further finds that the ongoing
transformation of Kakaako into a place where the people of Honolulu can live,
work, and play should increase the revenue generating potential of the land
conveyed to the office of Hawaiian affairs by Act 15 and concomitantly increase
the number of programs and kinds of services for which the office of Hawaiian
affairs was created and is able to provide for native Hawaiians.  The
legislature further finds that even more revenue could be generated to provide programs
and services to better the conditions of native Hawaiians if the office of
Hawaiian affairs were permitted to develop some or all of the parcels it
received under Act 15 for residential use.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature agrees that the residential
development restriction to which the parcels transferred to the office of
Hawaiian affairs by Act 15 were and continue to be subject should be lifted for
certain parcels to the extent necessary to allow the office of Hawaiian affairs
to realize the maximum income or proceeds that those parcels could generate if
they were developed for residential use.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature further finds that the State
continues to suffer from a shortage of affordable housing with fewer families
able to afford to buy or rent a home in the State.  Hawaii is the most
expensive state in the nation for housing, with its housing costs being 2.7
times the national average.  Housing costs in the State have tripled since
1990, resulting in a $850,000 median price for a single-family home.  This
price equates to a $252,000 annual income needed to afford a new median priced
home and fewer than one in three households in the State meet that income
threshold.  In addition, Native Hawaiians suffer disproportionately from this
lack of affordable housing.  Native Hawaiians have the highest rate of poverty
and the lowest median household income of the major ethnic groups in the State,
causing many to become homeless or to leave the State.  Therefore, it is
essential that a certain percentage of the residential units developed on certain
parcels of land conveyed to the office of Hawaiian affairs pursuant to Act 15 be
workforce housing allocated to households within a certain income range.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature also acknowledges that Act 172,
Session Laws of Hawaii 2023, appropriated funds into and out of the school
facilities special fund to construct housing prioritized for teachers,
educators, and staff.  Likewise, the legislature finds that priority for the
workforce housing developed on certain parcels of lands conveyed to the office
of Hawaiian affairs pursuant to Act 15 should be given to certain essential
workforce in the area.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Furthermore, the legislature acknowledges the
extensive planning and community outreach efforts by the Kakaako community planning
advisory council, which resulted in the 2011 Kakaako Makai Conceptual Master
Plan; the office of Hawaiian affairs' efforts, which produced the 2013 Kakaako
Makai Strategic Management Plan; and the Hawaii community development authority's
work and adoption of the 2017 Kakaako Makai Area Parks Master Plan and the 2023
Kakaako Community Development District Makai Area Plan.  The legislature strongly
encourages the office of Hawaiian affairs to incorporate development concepts
from these various plans into its master plan development proposal for Kakaako
makai to create a live, work, and play community that addresses the
recreational, cultural, educational, economic, and workforce housing needs of
the State.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Finally, the legislature finds that inasmuch as
this Act furthers one of the principle purposes for which the office of
Hawaiian affairs was established as a state agency, its provisions should be
deemed consistent with and not violative of article XI, section 5, of the
Hawaii State Constitution.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The purpose of this part is to enhance the
revenue generating capacity of certain parcels of land in the Kakaako makai
area, including parcels that were conveyed to the office of Hawaiian affairs
pursuant to Act 15 while making housing available to the essential workforce in
the area by:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Clarifying the process by which the Hawaii
community development authority may approve residential development on certain
parcels of Kakaako makai;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Raising the building height limit and the maximum
floor area ratio on certain parcels;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Requiring fifty per cent plus one of the residential
units developed on certain parcels to be allocated to households with income at
or below one hundred forty per cent of the area median income in perpetuity,
with priority given to individuals who are essential workers working within a
five-mile radius of Kakaako makai<a name="_Hlk179890332">, including but not
limited to essential workers working for an employer </a>in the health care,
hospitality, education, law enforcement, civil service, or construction
industry;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Limiting the sale of residential units developed
in certain residential developments to prospective owner&#8209;occupants; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Establishing a Kakaako makai special account in
the office of Hawaiian affairs special fund and association fee to fund various
services and projects in the Kakaako makai area.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     SECTION 2.  Chapter 206E, Hawaii Revised
Statutes, is amended by adding three new sections to part II to be
appropriately designated and to read as follows:</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>&quot;</b><b><u>§206E-A</u></b>  <b><u>Limited

development district, then the authority may approve the proposed residential
development project; provided that approval may be granted only after the
applicant seeking approval conducts public hearings pursuant to subsection (b)
and section 206E-5.6.</u></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <u>(b)  An applicant seeking approval of a plan
