Section 1:
SR141 THE SENATE S.R. NO. 141 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII SENATE RESOLUTION requesting the department of health to convene a demolition waste reduction working group. WHEREAS, Hawaii's landfills are nearing capacity, with the State facing significant community opposition to the expansion of existing facilities or the establishment of new facilities; and WHEREAS, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, construction and demolition waste constitutes approximately twenty-one to forty percent of landfill mass nationwide and represents one of the largest contributors to solid waste in Hawaii, further exacerbating landfill pressures; and WHEREAS, a comprehensive and coordinated cross-industry approach is critical to advancing the circular construction economy, reducing waste, and promoting sustainable practices across Hawaii's construction and demolition sectors; and WHEREAS, local recycling nonprofits and community-based organizations in Hawaii have made significant progress in advocating for deconstruction, reuse, and circular economy principles, but face barriers in scaling these efforts to have broader policy and economic impact; and WHEREAS, a construction and demolition waste reduction working group could serve as a catalyst to coordinate efforts across industries, identify resources, remove systemic barriers, and recommend targeted incentives that promote sustainable practices and economic growth; and WHEREAS, the adoption of reclaimed and reused materials, which are often low-embodied carbon alternatives to virgin materials, could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support Hawaii's carbon reduction goals, as outlined in Act 15, Session Laws of Hawaii 2018, which commits the State to carbon neutrality by 2045; and WHEREAS, landfills have historically been located near disadvantaged communities, disproportionately exposing these communities to health risks such as air pollution, groundwater contamination, and other environmental hazards, and addressing these injustices should be a central goal of sustainable waste management policies; and WHEREAS, the establishment of a working group will help make actionable recommendations, including reviewing potential approaches, proposing solutions, and prioritizing actions to promote deconstruction, materials reuse, and waste reduction; and WHEREAS, the Department of Health, given its mandate to protect public health and the environment, would be well-suited to lead the working group to ensure representation from all relevant stakeholders and alignment with Hawaii's sustainability and equity goals; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, that the Department of Health is requested to convene a Demolition Waste Reduction Working Group; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the working group is requested to: (1)  Identify and implement solutions to reduce construction and demolition waste statewide; (2)  Develop strategies to scale deconstruction and materials reuse to reduce landfill dependency; (3)  Support the growth of the circular construction economy by fostering public and private sector collaboration; (4)  Ensure alignment with Hawaiis carbon neutrality and environmental justice goals; and (5)  Create a framework for policy and economic incentives that promote sustainable practices; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the working group is requested to include the following members: (1)  The Director of Health, or their designee; (2)  The Comptroller, or their designee; and (3)  Private Sector Leaders invited to participate as members of the working group to include: (A)  One representative from the construction industry; (B)  One representative from the demolition and deconstruction industry;

(G)  One representative with expertise in urban planning; and (H)  One representative from the waste management industry; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the working group is requested to invite and involve community groups with expertise in workforce development, public policy, and environmental justice; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the working group is requested to focus on policy innovation and cross-industry collaboration, exploring best practices from successful circular economy programs in other regions, such as those implemented in Denmark, the Netherlands, and other global leaders in circular construction; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the working group is requested to submit annual reports of its findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, to the Legislature, no later than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular session; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the reports are requested to include the working group's successes and opportunities for further action in advancing the circular construction economy; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Director of Health and Comptroller.
