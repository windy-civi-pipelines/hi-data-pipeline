THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE. 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO ENERGY.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII;
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that it is imperative to
2 enable the development of affordable clean energy resources for
3 the benefit of utility customers in the State. Many existing
4 generating units in the State will need to be retired in the
5 next few years due to obsolescence and environmental permitting
6 requirements. The impending retirement of these units makes it
7 urgent to obtain replacement resources, without which the
8 reliability of electric supplies in the State will be at risk.
9 In addition, continued reliance on these aging units, even if
10 feasible, would result in increased costs for utility customers
11 and continued reliance on fossil fuels, contrary to the State's
12 policy to transition to renewable, non-carbon-emitting
13 resources.
14 The procurement or purchase of energy from replacement
15 clean energy resources by a certain investor-owned electric
16 utility and its electric utility subsidiaries is ongoing in its
17 Stage 3 request for proposals and further anticipated in its

1 first Integrated Grid Planning request for proposals. These
2 requests for proposals set forth energy plans that have been
3 developed through extensive engagement with local stakeholders
4 and communities and reviewed and approved by the public
5 utilities commission. The legislature finds that successful
6 purchase of energy from clean energy resources is in the public
7 interest and necessary to avoid significant detrimental
8 reliability and affordability impacts to electric utility
9 customers.
10 The legislature further finds that the development of clean
11 energy resources by independent power producers is essential to
12 achieve the State's goals of one hundred per cent net
13 electricity sales from renewable sources by 2045, a statewide
14 target to achieve a zero emissions economy and sequester more
15 atmospheric carbon and greenhouse gases than emitted by 2045,
16 and greater energy security and energy diversification, as
17 established by the Hawaii State Planning Act and existing public
18 utility laws.
19 The legislature also finds that continued development of
20 clean energy resources requires adequate assurances that
21 payments for purchased power will be made to independent power

1 producers as and when due by the utility under power purchase
2 agreements. The current sub-investment-grade status of a
3 certain investor-owned electric utility and its subsidiaries,
4 arising from the tragic events that occurred in the 2023 Maui
5 wildfires, has led independent power producers, and those who
6 would otherwise finance renewable energy projects, to raise
7 concerns about the reliability of payment by the utility and its
8 subsidiaries under power purchase agreements procured through
9 the Stage 3 and Integrated Grid Planning requests for proposals.
10 Those concerns have caused independent power producers to
11 terminate their renewable energy projects and may continue to
12 cause remaining independent power producers to cancel renewable
13 energy projects, increase the prices they would charge for
14 deliveries to address the inability to obtain financing due to
15 this perceived credit risk, or choose not to respond to the
16 electric utility’s Integrated Grid Planning request for
17 proposals. Either outcome would be contrary to the interests of
18 electric reliability and to electric utility customers in the
19 State•
20 The legislature further finds that the public interest
21 would be served if the department of budget and finance enters

1 into step-in agreements with independent power producers,
2 pursuant to which the department of budget and finance would
3 agree to make payments to an independent power producer after a
4 failure by the electric utility to make required payments
5 pursuant to the terms of a power purchase agreement. The
6 department of budget and finance's obligation to make payments
7 pursuant to the terms of a step-in agreement is limited to the
8 revenues received from power purchase charges associated with
9 power purchase agreements subject to step-in agreements and
10 reserve fees that are on deposit in the power purchase costs
11 trust fund established by the department of budget and finance.
12 Neither the full faith and credit of the State, nor any other
13 moneys of the State, will be pledged for any obligations under a
14 step-in agreement.
15 The legislature finds that step-in agreements may provide
16 assurances that payments for purchased power will be made to
17 independent power producers as and when due by the utility under
18 the covered power purchase agreements. The legislature also
19 finds that the intent of this Act is further served by
20 appointing, authorizing, and empowering the electric utility to
21 serve as the billing, collection, and payment agent of the

1 department of budget and finance. Prior to a payment default
2 under a covered power purchase agreement by the electric
3 utility, the electric utility will be authorized to utilize
4 revenues received from power purchase charges to discharge its
5 obligations to pay independent power producers for electric
6 energy and related services and products. The obligations of
7 the department of budget and finance under this Act are
8 undertaken for a public purpose, namely, the protection of
9 public health, safety, and welfare by supporting the development
10 of clean energy resources that are needed for the reliable
11 provision of electric supply at a reasonable cost.
12 Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to:
13 (1) Require the department of budget and finance to enter
14 into a step-in agreement with an independent power
15 producer, in which the department of budget and
16 finance agrees to make required payments to the
17 independent power producer from revenues received from
18 power purchase charges and reserve fees after a
19 failure by the electric utility to make required
20 payments pursuant to the terms of a power purchase
21 agreement;

12 (3) Establish that revenues collected from on-bill power
13 purchase charges associated with covered power
14 purchase agreements and money from a surcharge
15 supporting a reserve account that are deposited in the
16 power purchase costs trust fund shall be held in trust
17 by the department of budget and finance, and that
18 independent power producers shall hold a beneficial
19 interest in the moneys to the extent of the amounts
20 owed to each independent power producer under the
21 related covered power purchase agreements; and

3 trust fund to be administered by the department. The department
4 shall establish and maintain two separate accounts within the
5 fund, the first account to be utilized for the deposit of all

8 deposit of revenues received from reserve fees transferred by
9 the electric utility. The electric utility shall transfer to
10 the department for deposit into the applicable account in the
11 fund all revenues collected in connection with a covered power
12 purchase agreement from:
13 (1) Power purchase charges following a default of the

2 section 269-B(d), the fund shall cease to receive any revenues
3 from the power purchase charges collected by the electric
4 utility or its successor related to the terminated covered power
5 purchase agreement and the department, as directed by the
6 electric utility, shall pay to the electric utility or its
7 successor the remainder of any revenues in the fund attributable
8 to power purchase charges associated with the terminated covered
9 power purchase agreement related to the step-in agreement, which
10 shall be considered moneys of the electric utility or its
11 successor.
12 (d) The department shall be under no obligation to make
13 payment to any obligee in excess of the moneys in the fund. Any
14 default or failure by the department to make payments pursuant
15 to the terms of a step-in agreement under this part shall not
16 result in any recourse by the electric utility or an obligee to
17 any funds of the State. An obligee of a covered power purchase
18 agreement shall have only the benefit of revenues derived from
19 power purchase charges and the reserve fees collected and on
20 deposit in the fund. In any action concerning a breach by the
21 department of a step-in agreement, the sole and exclusive remedy

11 to the repayment of payment obligations under a covered power
12 purchase agreement to the extent that there is a shortfall in
13 the amount of revenues received from power purchase charges on
14 deposit in the fund. Reserve fees shall be collected in full by
15 the electric utility or its successors, as collection agents for
16 the department, through a surcharge that is separate and apart
17 from the electric utility's rates. Reserve fees may be included
18 in the purchased power adjustment clause on customer bills. The
19 department shall establish and maintain a separate account
20 within the fund to accept and account for revenues from reserve
21 fees, and the electric utility shall, within twenty-four hours

6 under this part. The electric utility shall not access the
7 reserve account or utilize the revenues from the reserve fees
8 deposited therein, except as directed by the department pursuant
9 to section 269-F(e). The public utilities commission may
10 require, in the financing order creating the surcharge, that, if
11 a default occurs by the electric utility in remittance of the

13 the application by the department, and without limiting any
14 other remedies available to the department by reason of the
15 default, shall order the sequestration and payment to the

6 commission shall order the electric utility or its successor to
7 perform the duties designated under subsection (a).
8 (c) The act of serving as an agent to bill and to collect
9 the power purchase charges and reserve fees shall not cause the
10 electric utility to be subject to the laws that regulate
11 financial institutions, escrow depositories, or collection
12 agencies. The electric utility shall not be responsible for
13 lending, underwriting, and credit determinations in respect to
14 these billing and collection activities.

THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE. 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO ENERGY.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII;
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that it is imperative to
2 enable the development of affordable clean energy resources for
3 the benefit of utility customers in the State. Many existing
4 generating units in the State will need to be retired in the
5 next few years due to obsolescence and environmental permitting
6 requirements. The impending retirement of these units makes it
7 urgent to obtain replacement resources, without which the
8 reliability of electric supplies in the State will be at risk.
9 In addition, continued reliance on these aging units, even if
10 feasible, would result in increased costs for utility customers
11 and continued reliance on fossil fuels, contrary to the State's
12 policy to transition to renewable, non-carbon-emitting
13 resources.
14 The procurement or purchase of energy from replacement
15 clean energy resources by a certain investor-owned electric
16 utility and its electric utility subsidiaries is ongoing in its
17 Stage 3 request for proposals and further anticipated in its

1 first Integrated Grid Planning request for proposals. These
2 requests for proposals set forth energy plans that have been
3 developed through extensive engagement with local stakeholders
4 and communities and reviewed and approved by the public
5 utilities commission. The legislature finds that successful
6 purchase of energy from clean energy resources is in the public
7 interest and necessary to avoid significant detrimental
8 reliability and affordability impacts to electric utility
9 customers.
10 The legislature further finds that the development of clean
11 energy resources by independent power producers is essential to
12 achieve the State's goals of one hundred per cent net
13 electricity sales from renewable sources by 2045, a statewide
14 target to achieve a zero emissions economy and sequester more
15 atmospheric carbon and greenhouse gases than emitted by 2045,
16 and greater energy security and energy diversification, as
17 established by the Hawaii State Planning Act and existing public
18 utility laws.
19 The legislature also finds that continued development of
20 clean energy resources requires adequate assurances that
21 payments for purchased power will be made to independent power

C.D. 1
1 producers as and when due by the utility under power purchase
2 agreements. The current sub-investment-grade status of a
3 certain investor-owned electric utility and its subsidiaries,
4 arising from the tragic events that occurred in the 2023 Maui
5 wildfires, has led independent power producers, and those who
6 would otherwise finance renewable energy projects, to raise
7 concerns about the reliability of payment by the utility and its
8 subsidiaries under power purchase agreements procured through
9 the Stage 3 and Integrated Grid Planning requests for proposals.
10 Those concerns have caused independent power producers to
11 terminate their renewable energy projects and may continue to
12 cause remaining independent power producers to cancel renewable
13 energy projects, increase the prices they would charge for
14 deliveries to address the inability to obtain financing due to
15 this perceived credit risk, or choose not to respond to the
16 electric utility’s Integrated Grid Planning request for
17 proposals. Either outcome would be contrary to the interests of
18 electric reliability and to electric utility customers in the
19 State•
20 The legislature further finds that the public interest
21 would be served if the department of budget and finance enters

1 into step-in agreements with independent power producers,
2 pursuant to which the department of budget and finance would
3 agree to make payments to an independent power producer after a
4 failure by the electric utility to make required payments
5 pursuant to the terms of a power purchase agreement. The
6 department of budget and finance's obligation to make payments
7 pursuant to the terms of a step-in agreement is limited to the
8 revenues received from power purchase charges associated with
9 power purchase agreements subject to step-in agreements and
10 reserve fees that are on deposit in the power purchase costs
11 trust fund established by the department of budget and finance.
12 Neither the full faith and credit of the State, nor any other
13 moneys of the State, will be pledged for any obligations under a
14 step-in agreement.
15 The legislature finds that step-in agreements may provide
16 assurances that payments for purchased power will be made to
17 independent power producers as and when due by the utility under
18 the covered power purchase agreements. The legislature also
19 finds that the intent of this Act is further served by
20 appointing, authorizing, and empowering the electric utility to
21 serve as the billing, collection, and payment agent of the

1 department of budget and finance. Prior to a payment default
2 under a covered power purchase agreement by the electric
3 utility, the electric utility will be authorized to utilize
4 revenues received from power purchase charges to discharge its
5 obligations to pay independent power producers for electric
6 energy and related services and products. The obligations of
7 the department of budget and finance under this Act are
8 undertaken for a public purpose, namely, the protection of
9 public health, safety, and welfare by supporting the development
10 of clean energy resources that are needed for the reliable
11 provision of electric supply at a reasonable cost.
12 Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to:
13 (1) Require the department of budget and finance to enter
14 into a step-in agreement with an independent power
15 producer, in which the department of budget and
16 finance agrees to make required payments to the
17 independent power producer from revenues received from
18 power purchase charges and reserve fees after a
19 failure by the electric utility to make required
20 payments pursuant to the terms of a power purchase
21 agreement;

12 (3) Establish that revenues collected from on-bill power
13 purchase charges associated with covered power
14 purchase agreements and money from a surcharge
15 supporting a reserve account that are deposited in the
16 power purchase costs trust fund shall be held in trust
17 by the department of budget and finance, and that
18 independent power producers shall hold a beneficial
19 interest in the moneys to the extent of the amounts
20 owed to each independent power producer under the
21 related covered power purchase agreements; and

2 established outside the state treasury the power purchase costs
3 trust fund to be administered by the department. The department
4 shall establish and maintain two separate accounts within the
5 fund, the first account to be utilized for the deposit of all
6 revenues received from power purchase charges transferred by the
7 electric utility and the second account to be utilized for the
8 deposit of revenues received from reserve fees transferred by
9 the electric utility. The electric utility shall transfer to
10 the department for deposit into the applicable account in the
11 fund all revenues collected in connection with a covered power
12 purchase agreement from:
13 (1) Power purchase charges following a default of the
14 covered power purchase agreement; and
15 (2) Reserve fees.
16 (b) Moneys in the fund shall be held by the department in
17 trust for the benefit of the obligees of covered power purchase

2 section 269-B(d), the fund shall cease to receive any revenues
3 from the power purchase charges collected by the electric
4 utility or its successor related to the terminated covered power
5 purchase agreement and the department, as directed by the
6 electric utility, shall pay to the electric utility or its
7 successor the remainder of any revenues in the fund attributable
8 to power purchase charges associated with the terminated covered
9 power purchase agreement related to the step-in agreement, which
10 shall be considered moneys of the electric utility or its
11 successor.
12 (d) The department shall be under no obligation to make
13 payment to any obligee in excess of the moneys in the fund. Any
14 default or failure by the department to make payments pursuant
15 to the terms of a step-in agreement under this part shall not
16 result in any recourse by the electric utility or an obligee to
17 any funds of the State. An obligee of a covered power purchase
18 agreement shall have only the benefit of revenues derived from
19 power purchase charges and the reserve fees collected and on
20 deposit in the fund. In any action concerning a breach by the
21 department of a step-in agreement, the sole and exclusive remedy

7 §269-E Reserve account; establxshxnent. (a) By August 1,
8 2025, the public utilities commission shall create a surcharge,
9 referred to as reserve fees, which shall be deposited into an
10 account within the fund and be pledged to secure and be applied
11 to the repayment of payment obligations under a covered power
12 purchase agreement to the extent that there is a shortfall in
13 the amount of revenues received from power purchase charges on
14 deposit in the fund. Reserve fees shall be collected in full by
15 the electric utility or its successors, as collection agents for
16 the department, through a surcharge that is separate and apart
17 from the electric utility's rates. Reserve fees may be included
18 in the purchased power adjustment clause on customer bills. The
19 department shall establish and maintain a separate account
20 within the fund to accept and account for revenues from reserve
21 fees, and the electric utility shall, within twenty-four hours

6 under this part. The electric utility shall not access the
7 reserve account or utilize the revenues from the reserve fees
8 deposited therein, except as directed by the department pursuant
9 to section 269-F(e). The public utilities commission may
10 require, in the financing order creating the surcharge, that, if
11 a default occurs by the electric utility in remittance of the
12 reserve fees collected, the public utilities commission, upon
13 the application by the department, and without limiting any
14 other remedies available to the department by reason of the
15 default, shall order the sequestration and payment to the
16 department of the reserve fees. Any order shall remain in full
17 force and effect notwithstanding any bankruptcy, reorganization,

15 designate the electric utility or its successor to act as an
16 agent of the department to provide billing, collection, payment,
17 and other related services. In any action concerning a breach

6 commission shall order the electric utility or its successor to
7 perform the duties designated under subsection (a).
8 (c) The act of serving as an agent to bill and to collect
9 the power purchase charges and reserve fees shall not cause the
10 electric utility to be subject to the laws that regulate
11 financial institutions, escrow depositories, or collection
12 agencies. The electric utility shall not be responsible for
13 lending, underwriting, and credit determinations in respect to
14 these billing and collection activities.
