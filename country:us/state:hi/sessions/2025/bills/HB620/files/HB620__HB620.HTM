Section 1:
HB620 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 620 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to education. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  This Act shall be known and may be cited as the Hawaii Braille Literacy Education Act. SECTION 2.  The legislature finds that literacy skills are fundamental to success in education, employment, and life for all members of society.  Braille is widely understood as an essential literacy tool for low vision and blind individuals.  A 2018 study from the Journal of Blindness Innovation and Research found that individuals who were braille readers since childhood reported higher levels of life-satisfaction, self-esteem, and job satisfaction than individuals who had not used braille as their primary reading medium during childhood. The legislature further finds that braille literacy skills are essential for low vision and blind students to learn, seek and maintain remunerative employment, and access the opportunities in life open to all regardless of disability. Although one hundred sixty students in Hawaii are registered with the American Printing House for the Blind to receive special education materials, only seventeen students have braille services in their special education programs.  The legislature believes that it is in the interest of the State to promote braille instruction and ensure timely access to braille instructional materials for low vision and blind students, their parents and teachers, and other school personnel to ensure all of Hawaii's students have access to appropriate educational services. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Require the department of education to include the instruction of braille and provision of braille instructional materials under certain circumstances; (2)  Require the department of education to establish and maintain a braille literacy resource center; and (3)  Appropriate funds. SECTION 3.  Chapter 302A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part braille services §302A-A  Policy.
