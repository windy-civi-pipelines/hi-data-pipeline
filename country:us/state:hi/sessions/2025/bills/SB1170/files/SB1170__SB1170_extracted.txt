SB1170 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1170 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE EXPEDITIOUS REDEVELOPMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  On August 8, 2023, a devastating wildfire destroyed much of Lahaina, resulting in the tragic loss of more than one hundred lives.  This disaster has also greatly exacerbated the existing acute affordable rental housing shortage in Lahaina and on the island of Maui. The legislature finds that the following projects were destroyed in the August 8, 2023, Lahaina wildfire: (1)  The Front street apartments project, which was previously a permanent, affordable multi-family rental housing project located on the parcel identified as tax map key number (2)4-5-003:013 and leased from the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation; (2)  The Lahaina Surf project, which was a permanent, affordable multi-family rental housing project owned and operated by Hale Mahaolu, a Hawaii nonprofit corporation; (3)  Piilani homes, which was a permanent, affordable multi-family rental housing project owned and operated by the Hawaii public housing authority and which consisted of ten buildings, five of which were destroyed and five of which remain standing but will likely require demolition. The project is considered a total loss. The Hawaii public housing authority prepared an after-the-fact section 18 application with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development to initiate demolition of the project, and the authority is still in the process of determining how best to proceed; and (4)  Weinberg Court Project, which was a permanent, affordable multi-family rental housing project owned by an affiliate of The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation Incorporated, and which was known as the Lahaina Affordable Rental Apartments Project; The legislature finds that these projects are currently in the process of being rebuilt, and that other projects, such as the Kahului civic center mixed use project, are being developed to address the shortage of affordable housing on the island of Maui.  The Kahului civic center mixed-use project is a collaboration among the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation, department of accounting and general services, and the county of Maui, and is envisioned to include affordable multi-family rental housing, civic center office space, parking, and a new Kahului bus hub. Given the urgent need for permanent, affordable multi-family rental housing in Lahaina and the county of Maui, the purpose of this Act is to assist the county of Maui in issuing special management area use permits required under chapter 205A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to: (1)  Redevelop permanent, affordable multi-family rental housing at the Front street apartments project, the Lahaina Surf project, the Piilani homes project, and the Weinberg Court project; and (2)  Develop mixed-use permanent, affordable multi-family rental housing at the Kahului civic center mixed-use project, as expeditiously as possible. SECTION 2. As used in this Act: "Front street apartments project" means a project that: (1)  The Hawaii housing finance and development corporation is currently in the process of redeveloping as permanent, affordable multi-family rental housing in conjunction with the redevelopment of the adjacent Lahaina Surf project owned by Hale Mahaolu; and (2)  Consists of three adjacent parcels of land, two of which are owned by the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation and identified as tax map key number (2)4-5-003:013 and tax map key number (2)4‑5‑003:014, and one vacant parcel of land identified as tax map key number (2)4-5-003:012, which the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation is in the process of acquiring from an affiliate of The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation Incorporated. "Lahaina Surf project" means the project that is: (1)  Located on a parcel of land identified as tax map key number (2)4-5-003:035; and (2)  Currently in the process of being redeveloped as permanent affordable multifamily rental housing by Hale Mahaolu. "Piilani homes project" means the project that is: (1)  Located on a parcel of land identified as tax map key number (2)4-5-007:005; and (2)  Currently in the process of being redeveloped as permanent, affordable multifamily rental housing by the Hawaii public housing authority. "Weinberg Court project" means the project that is: (1)  Located on a parcel of land identified as tax map key number (2)4-6-011:007; and (2)  Is currently in the process of being redeveloped for permanent affordable multi-family rental housing by the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation Incorporated. "Kahului civic center mixed-use project" means the project that is: (1)  Located on the parcel of land identified as tax map key number (2)3-7-004:003; and (2)  On which, the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation, through its contracted developer, EAH, Inc., is developing permanent, affordable multifamily rental housing. SECTION 3. (a)  Subject to terms and conditions as the director of planning of the county of Maui deems appropriate, the director may issue a special management area use permit to an applicant to redevelop permanent affordable multi-family rental housing at the Front street apartments project, the Lahaina Surf project, the Piilani homes project, and the Weinberg Court project, and to develop mixed‑use permanent affordable multi-family rental housing at the Kahului civic center mixed-use project. (b)  Except as otherwise provided in this Act or under federal law, the issuance of a special management area use permit under this section for the Front street apartments project, the Lahaina Surf project, the Piilani homes project, the Weinberg Court project, and the Kahului civic center mixed-use project shall be exempt from all statutes, charter provisions, ordinances, and rules relating to the issuance of special management area use permits under chapter 205A, Hawaii Revised Statutes. (c) After the special management area use permits for the Front street apartments project, the Lahaina Surf project, the Piilani homes project, the Weinberg Court apartments project, and the Kahului civic center mixed-use project are issued, the department of planning of the county of Maui shall file a notice of the issuance in the next available issue of the periodic bulletin of the office of planning and sustainable development. SECTION 4. If any provision of this Act, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the Act that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this Act are severable.
