HB917 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 917 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO SENTENCING. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii bears the shameful reputation, according to a 2024 article published by the Journal of Medical Internet Research, of being the "methamphetamine capital of the United States".  The article noted that methamphetamine abuse "is highly prevalent in Hawaii, especially among Indigenous Pacific Peoples", and also noted that from 2015 to 2018 1.5 per cent of Hawaiian residents used methamphetamine annually, which was more than twice the national rate of 0.6 per cent. The legislature also finds that the according to Hawaii News Now, in 2023, two hundred twenty people died with methamphetamine in their system, which was ten per cent higher than the number of people who died with same drug in their system in 2022.  Further, one hundred seven fentanyl-related deaths occurred statewide, in 2023, up seventy-nine from 2022, for an increase of thirty-five per cent. The legislature further finds that according to a recent study from the university of Hawaii at Manoa, methamphetamine poisoning is the leading cause of fatal overdoses among midlife and older adults in Hawaii.  The study determined that people who use drugs long-term in Hawaii tend to favor methamphetamine, and this trend becomes more lethal as they age. The legislature believes that the use of these drugs must be deterred. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for persons convicted of offenses based on the possession of methamphetamine or fentanyl. SECTION 2.  Section 706-620, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "PART II. PROBATION §706-620  Authority to withhold sentence of imprisonment.  A defendant who has been convicted of a crime may be sentenced to a term of probation unless: (1)  The crime is first or second degree murder or attempted first or second degree murder; (2)  The crime is a class A felony, except class A felonies defined in [chapter]: (A)  Chapter 712, part IV, but not including any offense involving the possession of: (i)  Methamphetamine, including its salts, isomers, salts of isomers, and immediate precursors; or (ii)  Fentanyl, including its isomers, esters, ethers, salts, and salts of isomers; and [by section] (B)  Section 707-702; (3)  The defendant is a repeat offender under section‑706‑606.5; (4)  The defendant is a felony firearm offender as defined in section 706-660.1(2); (5)  The crime involved the death of or the infliction of serious or substantial bodily injury upon a child, an elder person, or a handicapped person under section 706-660.2; or (6)  The crime is cruelty to animals where ten or more pet animals were involved under section 711-1108.5 or 711‑1109." SECTION 3.  Section 706-622.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (1) to read as follows: "(1) Notwithstanding section 706-620(3), a person convicted for the first or second time for any offense under section 329-43.5, except offenses under subsections (a) and (b) of that section which constitute violations, involving the possession or use of drug paraphernalia or any felony offense under part IV of chapter 712 involving the possession or use of any dangerous drug, detrimental drug, harmful drug, intoxicating compound, marijuana, or marijuana concentrate, as defined in section 712-1240, but not including any offense under part IV of chapter 712 involving the distribution or manufacture of any such drugs or substances and not including any methamphetamine offenses under sections 712-1240.7, 712-1240.8 as that section was in effect before July 1, 2016, 712-1241, [and] 712-1242, and 712-1243 and not including any offense involving the possession of fentanyl, including its isomers, esters, ethers, salts, and salts of isomers under sections 712-1241, 712-1242, and 712‑1243, is eligible to be sentenced to probation under subsection (2) if the person meets the following criteria: (a)  The court has determined that the person is nonviolent after reviewing the person's criminal history, the factual circumstances of the offense for which the person is being sentenced, and any other relevant information; (b)  The person has been assessed by a certified substance abuse counselor to be in need of substance abuse treatment due to dependency or abuse under the applicable Diagnostic and Statistical Manual and Addiction Severity Index; and (c)  Except for those persons directed to substance abuse treatment under the supervision of the drug court, the person presents a proposal to receive substance abuse treatment in accordance with the treatment plan prepared by a certified substance abuse counselor through a substance abuse treatment program that includes an identified source of payment for the treatment program."
