Section 1:
HB589 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 589 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to CONDOMINIUM insurance. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that before the Maui wildfires on August 8, 2023, the availability of condominium building master property insurance policy options within the condominium insurance marketplace was already shrinking.  Due in part to the shrinking condominium insurance marketplace, the cost of condominium building master insurance policies has increased exponentially, with insurers increasing deductible amounts from approximately $10,000 to $25,000 per unit, per occurrence, to as much as $250,000. These increased deductibles are also due to consistent and high-cost losses. The legislature also finds that while the State has not experienced a direct, major impact from a major hurricane since hurricane Iniki devastated Kauai and damaged homes along Oahu's leeward coast more than thirty years ago, mortgage lenders continue to require Hawaii homeowners to carry hurricane insurance that can cost two to three times the amount of annual premiums of a conventional homeowner policy.  The governor's emergency proclamation dated August 7, 2024, enabled the executive branch to provide additional options for condominium associations to purchase hurricane and property insurance for their buildings by authorizing: (1)  Loans to the Hawaii hurricane relief fund and the Hawaii property insurance association to facilitate the issuance of hurricane and property insurance policies to condominium associations; and (2)  The Hawaii hurricane relief fund to issue hurricane insurance policies for large condominium buildings and set policy limits. The legislature also acknowledges that although insurance coverage, excluding hurricane coverage, for condominium buildings is available in the standard insurance market, the availability of this coverage is not guaranteed. The legislature further acknowledges that the city and county of Honolulu's requirement for mandatory fire sprinkler retrofits or alternative fire safety upgrades in older condominium properties covered by ordinance 18-14, as amended by ordinance 22-2, has resulted in insurance premium increases of one hundred per cent or more since 2022, and substantial expenses to comply with the ordinance for more than three hundred high-rise properties on Oahu. The purpose of this Act is to establish a mutual insurance program to provide coverage to stabilize the insurance market serving Hawaii high‑rise residential condominium properties. SECTION 2.  Chapter 431, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new article to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Article HAWAII CONDOMINIUM MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY §431: -101  Purpose.  There is established the Hawaii condominium mutual insurance company to provide property and casualty insurance coverage to high-rise residential condominiums and the owners of units within those condominiums at the highest level of service with the lowest possible cost, consistent with reasonable and applicable actuarial standards and the sound financial integrity of each residential condominium property association. §431:   -102 Definitions.  As used in this article: "Administrator" means the chief executive officer of the Hawaii condominium mutual insurance company.
