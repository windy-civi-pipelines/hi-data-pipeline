Section 1:
HB1203 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1203 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO HAWAIIAN LANGUAGE IMMERSION EDUCATION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature recognizes that Article X, section 4 of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii requires the State to "promote the study of Hawaiian culture, history and language", and also requires the State to "provide for a Hawaiian education program consisting of language, culture and history in the public schools".  The legislature finds that the department of education has implemented a Hawaiian language immersion program, but the only immersion school on the island of Oahu that is open to students in grades kindergarten through twelve is located in Palolo. The legislature also finds that at present, the leeward area of the island of Oahu does not have a similar immersion school, despite census data indicating that the area has the largest number of native Hawaiian residents in the State.  Consequently, many students in the Leeward area need to leave home at 5:00 a.m. to attend a Hawaiian language immersion school, and are unable to return home to their families until late in the evening.  This shortage of Hawaiian language immersion schools makes Hawaiian language immersion unattainable for many families that rely on their children to assist in the care of siblings or other family members, or otherwise provide for their households.  This situation demonstrates that the State is currently failing to fulfill its duties under Article X, section 4 of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to appropriate moneys to establish a Hawaiian language immersion school, open to students in grades kindergarten through twelve, that is located in the leeward area of the island of Oahu. SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $            or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the department of education to establish a Hawaiian language immersion school, open to students in grades kindergarten through twelve, that is located in the leeward area of the island of Oahu. The sums appropriated shall be expended by the department of education for the purposes of this Act. SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2025. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: DOE; Hawaiian Language Immersion Education; Oahu; Leeward Description: Appropriate moneys to the Department of Education to establish a Hawaiian language immersion school, open to students in grades kindergarten through 12, that is located in the Leeward area of the island of Oahu.
