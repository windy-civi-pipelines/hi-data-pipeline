Section 1:
SB1552 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1552 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to the psychology interjurisdictionAL compact. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that safeguarding, enhancing, and prioritizing the mental health of the people is essential not only for the well-being of individuals but also for the broader public interest.  Protection of mental health contributes to a healthier, more resilient society, benefiting all members of the community. The legislature recognizes that there is a growing demand for mental health care services, particularly on the neighbor islands and in rural and underserved areas. Despite this need, the current shortage of mental health professionals and services fails to meet the increasing demand, leaving countless individuals without the critical care they deserve.  This lack of access disproportionately affects vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, those with mobility challenges, and youth who face identity-based harassment or rejection. The legislature also finds reports of neighbor island communities experiencing a critical lack of access to care for the mental and physical well-being of vulnerable members of the LGBTQ+ community, particularly youth, who face alarmingly high rates of suicide attempts.  Accessing mental health care services provided by licensed psychologists is crucial to providing essential care and ultimately lowering the suicide rates within this vulnerable population. The legislature further finds that over forty states have already joined the psychology interjurisdictional compact to address similar issues of access. Participating in this compact will enable vulnerable kamaaina to return home without risking the loss of critical relationships with long time therapists and counselors and help Hawaii meet the growing demand for mental health care needs by reducing barriers for mental health professionals to practice and providing residents with access to a broader pool of qualified mental health professionals through telepsychology and temporary in-person services. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to adopt the Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact to: (1)  Regulate the day-to-day practice of telepsychology by psychologists across state boundaries in the performance of their psychological practice as assigned by an appropriate authority; (2)  Regulate the temporary in-person, face-to-face practice of psychology by psychologists across state boundaries for thirty days within a calendar year in the performance of their psychological practice as assigned by an appropriate authority; and (3)  Require the department of commerce and consumer affairs to adopt rules to implement and administer the compact. SECTION 2. The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Chapter Psychology InterjurisdictionAL Compact §   -1.  Short title.  This chapter may be cited as the Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact. §   -2.  Terms and provisions of compact; authorization; governor.  The legislature hereby authorizes the governor to enter into a compact on behalf of the State of Hawaii with any other state legally joining therein, in the form substantially as follows: PSYCHOLOGY INTERJURISDICTIONAL COMPACT (PSYPACT) ARTICLE I PURPOSE Whereas, states license psychologists, in order to protect the public through verification of education, training and experience and ensure accountability for professional practice; and Whereas, this Compact is intended to regulate the day to day practice of telepsychology (i.e., the provision of psychological services using telecommunication technologies) by psychologists across state boundaries in the performance of their psychological practice as assigned by an appropriate authority; and Whereas, this Compact is intended to regulate the temporary in-person, face-to-face practice of psychology by psychologists across state boundaries for 30 days within a calendar year in the performance of their psychological practice as assigned by an appropriate authority; and Whereas, this Compact is intended to authorize State Psychology Regulatory Authorities to afford legal recognition, in a manner consistent with the terms of the Compact, to psychologists licensed in another state; and Whereas, this Compact recognizes that states have a vested interest in protecting the public's health and safety through their licensing and regulation of psychologists and that such state regulation will best protect public health and safety; and Whereas, this Compact does not apply when a psychologist is licensed in both the Home and Receiving States; and Whereas, this Compact does not apply to permanent in‑person, face-to-face practice, it does allow for authorization of temporary psychological practice.

Raw Text:
SB1552 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1552 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to the psychology interjurisdictionAL compact. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that safeguarding, enhancing, and prioritizing the mental health of the people is essential not only for the well-being of individuals but also for the broader public interest.  Protection of mental health contributes to a healthier, more resilient society, benefiting all members of the community. The legislature recognizes that there is a growing demand for mental health care services, particularly on the neighbor islands and in rural and underserved areas. Despite this need, the current shortage of mental health professionals and services fails to meet the increasing demand, leaving countless individuals without the critical care they deserve.  This lack of access disproportionately affects vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, those with mobility challenges, and youth who face identity-based harassment or rejection. The legislature also finds reports of neighbor island communities experiencing a critical lack of access to care for the mental and physical well-being of vulnerable members of the LGBTQ+ community, particularly youth, who face alarmingly high rates of suicide attempts.  Accessing mental health care services provided by licensed psychologists is crucial to providing essential care and ultimately lowering the suicide rates within this vulnerable population. The legislature further finds that over forty states have already joined the psychology interjurisdictional compact to address similar issues of access. Participating in this compact will enable vulnerable kamaaina to return home without risking the loss of critical relationships with long time therapists and counselors and help Hawaii meet the growing demand for mental health care needs by reducing barriers for mental health professionals to practice and providing residents with access to a broader pool of qualified mental health professionals through telepsychology and temporary in-person services. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to adopt the Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact to: (1)  Regulate the day-to-day practice of telepsychology by psychologists across state boundaries in the performance of their psychological practice as assigned by an appropriate authority; (2)  Regulate the temporary in-person, face-to-face practice of psychology by psychologists across state boundaries for thirty days within a calendar year in the performance of their psychological practice as assigned by an appropriate authority; and (3)  Require the department of commerce and consumer affairs to adopt rules to implement and administer the compact. SECTION 2. The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Chapter Psychology InterjurisdictionAL Compact §   -1.  Short title.  This chapter may be cited as the Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact. §   -2.  Terms and provisions of compact; authorization; governor.  The legislature hereby authorizes the governor to enter into a compact on behalf of the State of Hawaii with any other state legally joining therein, in the form substantially as follows: PSYCHOLOGY INTERJURISDICTIONAL COMPACT (PSYPACT) ARTICLE I PURPOSE Whereas, states license psychologists, in order to protect the public through verification of education, training and experience and ensure accountability for professional practice; and Whereas, this Compact is intended to regulate the day to day practice of telepsychology (i.e., the provision of psychological services using telecommunication technologies) by psychologists across state boundaries in the performance of their psychological practice as assigned by an appropriate authority; and Whereas, this Compact is intended to regulate the temporary in-person, face-to-face practice of psychology by psychologists across state boundaries for 30 days within a calendar year in the performance of their psychological practice as assigned by an appropriate authority; and Whereas, this Compact is intended to authorize State Psychology Regulatory Authorities to afford legal recognition, in a manner consistent with the terms of the Compact, to psychologists licensed in another state; and Whereas, this Compact recognizes that states have a vested interest in protecting the public's health and safety through their licensing and regulation of psychologists and that such state regulation will best protect public health and safety; and Whereas, this Compact does not apply when a psychologist is licensed in both the Home and Receiving States; and Whereas, this Compact does not apply to permanent in‑person, face-to-face practice, it does allow for authorization of temporary psychological practice.
