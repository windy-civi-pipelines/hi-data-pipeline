Section 1:
HB1462 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1462 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to crisis services. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Act 86, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024, established a crisis intervention and diversion services program within the department of health to expand existing services and divert those with mental health issues to appropriate health care services.  This program, along with the new behavioral health crisis center at the Iwilei resource center, connects individuals, including those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, to appropriate crisis services and other community resources. While these programs have proven successful, often the scope of the programs is not enough to cover all areas of the State. The legislature further finds that homelessness is a significant issue in west Oahu, with a noticeable presence of unsheltered individuals living in parks and along the coastline, particularly around the Waianae area.  Some of these unsheltered individuals suffer from issues relating to drugs, alcohol, or mental illness and do not have access to the appropriate services for help. Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to expand the crisis intervention and diversion services program by ensuring that the program services individuals residing in west Oahu. SECTION 2.  Section 334-171, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows: "(a)  There shall be established within the department [a] crisis intervention and diversion services program to redirect persons experiencing mental health disorders and co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders who are at risk for involvement, or currently involved, with the criminal justice system to the appropriate health care system and services[.]; provided that the department shall establish at least two crisis intervention and diversion services sites on the island of Oahu; provided further that of the two sites on Oahu, one site shall be located within the 96792 postal zip code. The department shall collaborate with law enforcement agencies, courts, mental health providers, and the community for the execution and implementation of these services." SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: Crisis Intervention and Diversion Services Program; Department of Health; West Oahu Description: Expands the Crisis Intervention and Diversion Services Program to include at least two sites on the island of Oahu, including one program in west Oahu.
