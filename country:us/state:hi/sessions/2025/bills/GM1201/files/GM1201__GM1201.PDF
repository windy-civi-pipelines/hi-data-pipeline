THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO THE GREEN JOBS YOUTH CORPS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAH:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that youth and young
2 adults coramonly experience unemployment at higher rates than the
3 general population. Prolonged youth unemployment can have
4 profound negative impacts on the lifetime earnings and
5 well-being of individuals, and action is needed to provide
6 better work opportunities for Hawaii’s youth and young adults.
7 The legislature also finds that the State has set ambitious
8 goals in the areas of economic diversification, environmental
9 management, and energy self-sufficiency. An important element
10 of reaching these goals is investing in a workforce that is both
11 skilled and experienced in sustainability-related professions.
12 The legislature notes that the Civilian Conservation Corps,
13 a federal work relief program created during the Great
14 Depression, employed Americans for conservation projects of
15 local, state, and national benefit, providing opportunities for
16 displaced young adults. While the Civilian Conservation Corps
17 disbanded in 1942, the concept lives on through The Corps

C.D. 1
1 Network, a national association of service and conservation
2 corps that provide opportunities for young adults and veterans
3 to serve their communities and the environment.
4 The State also established the Hawaii youth conservation
5 corps, a program that provides young individuals with
6 opportunities in conservation on a smaller scale. This program
7 currently operates within the policies set out under chapter
8 193, Hawaii Revised Statutes.
9 The legislature recognizes that Act 9, Session Laws of
10 Hawaii 2020, appropriated funds designated for the State by the
11 federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act to
12 establish a workforce and training program that, among other
13 accomplishments, funded a short-term green jobs program in
14 partnership with the Hawaii-based nonprofit organization Kupu
15 Aina Corps (Kupu). Kupu’s partnership with conservation and
16 agriculture host sites enabled individuals to work in their own
17 communities while giving back to the State’s economy and
18 environment. Through this short-term program, over three
19 hundred fifty displaced workers and recent graduates were
20 matched with work and training opportunities across the State.

C.D. 1
1 The legislature further recognizes that Act 181, Session
2 Laws of Hawaii 2021, authorized the governor to designate the
3 department of land and natural resources as the administrator of
4 the State’s green jobs youth corps program and provided funding
5 for the administration of the program. In 2022, the legislature
6 amended the requirements for this program and provided
7 additional funding through Act 33, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022.
8 The legislature additionally finds that the green jobs
9 youth corps program is an important part of the State's strategy
10 to diversify the economy and reach its environmental and energy
11 self-sufficiency goals. In addition, this program invests in
12 building the human capital of young adults who are interested in
13 working in sustainability-related professions. The legislature
14 therefore finds great value in the continuation of the green
15 jobs youth corps program, which requires additional funding.
16 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to appropriate
17 funds for the continuation of the green jobs youth corps
18 program.
19 SECTION 2, There is appropriated out of the general
20 revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $2,000,000 or so much
21 thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the
2025-3419 HB316 CDl HMSO 2

2 2026-2027 for the green jobs youth corps program; provided that,
3 notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the department of land
4 and natural resources and its partner or partners may obtain and
5 utilize federal or other outside funding for the purpose of
6 matching state funds provided for the green jobs youth corps
7 program.
8 The sums appropriated shall be expended by the department
9 of land and natural resources for the purposes of this Act.
10 SECTION 3. This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2025.
