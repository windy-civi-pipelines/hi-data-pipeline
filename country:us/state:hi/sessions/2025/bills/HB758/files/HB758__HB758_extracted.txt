HB758 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 758 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to sex-based discrimination. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the Patsy Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act, also known as Title IX, triggered a seismic shift in the education landscape by prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex by any education program or activity receiving federal funds.  Hawaii is proud of Congresswoman Mink's signature legislation, which has given millions of girls and women educational opportunities in the classroom, on playing fields, in employment, in graduate schools, and in research, teaching, medicine, law, and other professions that were out of reach prior to the enactment of Title IX. The legislature recognizes, however, that Congresswoman Mink's goals for Title IX have not been fully realized, and that the efficacy of Title IX federal protections against sex discrimination in education has been diminished and eroded.  Decades after Title IX's enactment, the state department of education remains out of compliance, as does the university of Hawaii system. The legislature notes that annual reports from the university of Hawaii, department of education schools, and state public charter schools on Title IX sex-based discrimination and non-Title IX sexual harassment complaints received by the schools suggest that, when compared with data from student surveys, incidents of sex-based discrimination and sex-based harassment go largely unreported. This creates a hostile environment and can negatively impact a student's learning, mental health, physical wellbeing, and ability to continue their education.  Stronger state protections are needed to ensure that no student is denied, or faces barriers to, equal educational opportunities on the basis of the student's sex. The legislature also notes that the incoming federal administration has expressed an intention to eliminate certain federal civil rights protections and leave these issues to the states.  Maintaining a vague framework in state law and relying primarily on federal Title IX protections may not be sufficient in these times. The legislature further finds that the courts have consistently interpreted the relationship between federal and state protections in areas where states have enacted stronger laws as one where federal law establishes a baseline or "floor", allowing states to provide greater protections without being preempted, as long as there is no direct conflict with federal law.  This principle is rooted in the concept of federalism, which permits states to legislate in areas not exclusively reserved for federal authority, as long as their laws do not obstruct federal objectives. In State v. Viglielmo, 105 Haw. 197 (2004), the Hawaii supreme court emphasized that states have a sovereign right to adopt constitutional provisions and laws that confer broader individual liberties than those provided by the federal constitution.  The court noted that Hawaii's constitution has often been interpreted to afford greater protections than its federal counterpart, particularly when a sound regard for the purpose of the rights involved warrants such an expansion.  This case illustrates that state courts can interpret their constitutions and statutes to provide enhanced protections, even in areas where federal law applies, as long as the state law does not contravene federal constitutional provisions or amount to a taking without just compensation. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to clarify and strengthen the State's protections against sex-based harassment, sex discrimination, and retaliation, including discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy, and pregnancy-related conditions. SECTION 2.  Chapter 368D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding eight new sections to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§368D-A  Protections against sex-based harassment, sex discrimination, and retaliation.  (a) A covered entity shall promptly and effectively respond to any complaint of sex-based harassment, sex discrimination, or retaliation that occurred: (1)  On the covered entity's campus; (2)  On the covered entity's digital platform; or (3)  At a covered educational program or activity; (b)  A covered entity may dismiss a complaint of sex-based harassment, sex discrimination, or retaliation at any time if the complainant is no longer a student or an employee of the covered entity; provided that the covered entity shall continue to offer supportive measures to the complainant.

SECTION 3.  Section 368D-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§368D-1  Covered educational programs and activities; discrimination prohibited.  (a)  No person in the State, on the basis of sex, including gender identity or expression as defined in section 489-2, [or] sexual orientation as defined in section 489-2, or pregnancy or related condition, shall be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any covered educational program or activity.

HB758 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 758 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to sex-based discrimination.
