C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO CRISIS SERVICES.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION I. The legislature finds that Act 86, Session Laws
2 of Hawaii 2024, established a crisis intervention and diversion
3 services program within the department of health to expand
4 existing services and divert those with mental health issues to
5 appropriate health care services. This program, along with the
6 new behavioral health crisis center at the Iwilei resource
7 center, connects individuals, including those who are homeless
8 or at risk of homelessness, to appropriate crisis services and
9 other community resources. While these programs have proven
10 successful, often the scope of the programs is not enough to
11 cover all areas of the State.
12 The legislature further finds that homelessness is a
13 significant issue on Oahu, with a noticeable presence of
14 unsheltered individuals, some of whom suffer from issues
15 relating to drugs, alcohol, or mental illness and do not have
16 access to the appropriate services for help.

C.D. 1
1 Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to expand the crisis
2 intervention and diversion services program by establishing two
3 crisis intervention and diversion services sites on Oahu.
4 SECTION 2. Section 334-171, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
5 amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:
6 "(a) There shall be established within the department a
7 crisis intervention and diversion services program to redirect
8 persons experiencing mental health disorders [and] or co­
9 occurring mental health and substance use disorders, or both,
10 who are at risk for involvement, or currently involved, with the
11 criminal justice system to the appropriate health care system
12 and services. The program shall establish at least two crisis
13 intervention and diversion services sites on the island of Oahu;
14 provided that of the two sites on Oahu, one site shall be
15 located in an area for which data shows disproportionate numbers
16 of individuals with mental health disorders or co-occurring
17 mental health and substance use disorders, or both. The program
18 may include the use of intensive mobile treatment services. The
19 department shall collaborate with law enforcement agencies,
20 courts, mental health providers, and the community for the
21 execution and implementation of these services."
