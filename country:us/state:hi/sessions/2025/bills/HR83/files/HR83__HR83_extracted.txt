Section 1:
HR83 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.R. NO. 83 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII HOUSE RESOLUTION requesting the Auditor to research implementing a law to require legislator salaries to be tied to median teacher salaries. WHEREAS, educators represent the foundation upon which our democratic society is built, fostering the development of informed, engaged, and civic-minded citizens; and WHEREAS, the value placed on education in policy is not consistently reflected in the compensation provided to those who deliver it; and WHEREAS, legislators, as representatives of the people's interests, should maintain a tangible connection to the economic realities faced by vital public servants; and WHEREAS, a Commission on Salaries is established, pursuant to article XVI, section 3.5, of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii, to review and recommend salaries for a variety of state positions, including members of the Legislature; and WHEREAS, establishing a direct relationship between legislator compensation and teacher salaries creates a shared economic interest that may foster more informed policy decisions regarding education funding and reform; and WHEREAS, this alignment serves as a symbolic and practical affirmation of the essential role that education plays in our democratic institutions and collective prosperity; and WHEREAS, the work of teachers and legislators are similar, with teachers: (1)  Having a similar schedule to what a full-time legislative calendar would be, with a two-month break in the summer and two-week break in the winter; (2)  Being in constant contact with parents, students, and administrators, similar to how legislators are in constant contact with constituents, community organizations, and agencies; and (3)  Oftentimes being a part of the community and having to be approached by students families, sharing similar sacrifices of privacy that legislators experience, who are public figures that have to interact with the public; and WHEREAS, although teachers have to meet minimum standards and obtain certifications through a process that is based on content knowledge and pedagogy to be a licensed teacher, no parallel process is established for legislators; and WHEREAS, consideration should be given to tie the base salaries of legislators to the median salary of licensed teachers, thereby establishing a compensation structure that honors the parallel importance of these public service roles and creates a shared stake in the economic valuation of education in our society; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, that the Auditor is requested to research the requirements, parameters, and necessary details for implementing a law to require legislator salaries to be tied to median teacher salaries; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that in conducting its research, the Auditor is requested to examine jurisdictions that have established laws or regulations tying the salaries of legislators to other government positions; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Auditor is requested to submit a report of its findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, to the Legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2026; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Auditor and Chairperson of the Commission on Salaries.
