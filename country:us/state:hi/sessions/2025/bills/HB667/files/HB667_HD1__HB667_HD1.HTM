Section 1:
HB667 HD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 667 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO TRANSPORTATION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "Mila Microchip Identification Act". SECTION 2.  The legislature finds that since January 1, 2022, all cat and dog owners in Hawaii have been required to have a microchip implanted in their pet and to register that microchip number and the owner's contact information with a microchip registration company.  The legislature further finds that when employees of the state and county agencies responsible for disposing roadkill pick up dead cats and dogs that have been killed on public roadways, they do not routinely scan the deceased animals for microchips or take any other measures to ascertain the animal's owner. As a result, owners of lost cats or dogs are not informed if their pet has been killed by a vehicle. The legislature further finds that the tragic incident involving a dog named Mila, as reported by KITV News on November 8, 2024, highlights a critical gap in existing policies and procedures.  Due to the absence of proper scanning equipment within the department of transportation and the lack of clear rules for owner notification, Mila was disposed of without her owner being informed.  This measure seeks to address such deficiencies by establishing clear directives for notification and the use of scanning equipment to prevent similar occurrences in the future. Furthermore, the legislature recognizes that this measure aligns with the intent expressed in the previous legislative session through House Concurrent Resolution No. 171 and House Resolution No. 150. By enacting this legislation, the legislature affirms its commitment to animal welfare and responsible procedures for handling lost or deceased pets. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to require the appropriate state and county agencies to: (1)  Scan deceased cats and dogs collected from public roadways for microchips and, if applicable, record the microchip as well as any other relevant information from the animal's tag or collar; and (2)  Notify county animal services or animal service contractors of the deceased dog or cat. SECTION 3.  Chapter 264, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§264-     Deceased cats and dogs; disposal.  (a) When disposing of a deceased cat or dog found on a public roadway, the department of transportation shall check for, scan, and record the microchip of the deceased cat or dog, if any, along with the location found, descriptive information of the cat or dog and, if applicable, any contact information such as a phone number, name, or address shown on the animal's collar or tag. (b) When disposing of a deceased cat or dog found on a public roadway, the department of transportation shall timely notify the appropriate county animal services or animal service contractors of the deceased cat or dog, including the microchip number, if any; location found; descriptive information about the cat or dog; and, if applicable, any contact information such as a phone number, name, or address shown on the animal's collar or tag. (c)  A county agency assisting with the disposal of a deceased cat or dog found on a public roadway under the jurisdiction of the State shall collaborate with the department of transportation to utilize the department's microchip scanners to satisfy the requirements of this section." SECTION 4.  Chapter 265A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§265A-     Deceased cats and dogs; disposal.  (a) When disposing of a deceased cat or dog found on a public roadway, the appropriate county department shall check for, scan, and record the microchip of the deceased cat or dog, if any, along with the location found, descriptive information of the cat or dog and, if applicable, any contact information such as a phone number, name, or address shown on the animal's collar or tag. (b) When disposing of a deceased cat or dog found on a public roadway, the appropriate county department shall timely notify the appropriate county animal services or animal service contractors of the deceased cat or dog, including the microchip number, if any; location found; descriptive information about the cat or dog; and, if applicable, any contact information such as a phone number, name, or address shown on the animal's collar or tag." SECTION 5.  New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 6.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 3000. Report Title: Deceased Pet Animals; Public Roadways; Microchips; Notification Description: Requires the Department of Transportation or appropriate county department when disposing of a deceased cat or dog from a public roadway to scan the animal for a microchip, record certain information, and report that information to the appropriate county animal services or animal service contractors.  Requires certain county agencies to collaborate with the Department of Transportation in utilizing the Department's microchip scanners.  Effective 7/1/3000.  (HD1) The summary description of legislation appearing on this page is for informational purposes only and is not legislation or evidence of legislative intent.
