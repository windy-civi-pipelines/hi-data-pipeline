Section 1:
HB667 CD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 667 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII S.D. 1 C.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO TRANSPORTATION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "Mila Microchip Identification Act". SECTION 2.  The legislature finds that since January 1, 2022, all cat and dog owners in Hawaii have been required to have a microchip implanted in their pet and to register that microchip number and the owner's contact information with a microchip registration company.  The legislature further finds that when employees of the state and county agencies responsible for disposing roadkill pick up dead cats and dogs that have been killed on public roadways, they do not routinely scan the deceased animals for microchips or take any other measures to ascertain the animal's owner. As a result, owners of lost cats or dogs are not informed if their pet has been killed by a vehicle. The legislature further finds that the tragic incident involving a dog named Mila, as reported by KITV News on November 8, 2024, highlights a critical gap in existing policies and procedures.  Due to the absence of proper scanning equipment within the department of transportation and the lack of clear rules for owner notification, Mila was disposed of without her owner being informed.  This measure seeks to address such deficiencies by establishing clear directives for notification and the use of scanning equipment to prevent similar occurrences in the future. Furthermore, the legislature recognizes that this measure aligns with the intent expressed in the previous legislative session through House Concurrent Resolution No. 171 and House Resolution No. 150.  By enacting this legislation, the legislature affirms its commitment to animal welfare and responsible procedures for handling lost or deceased pets. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Require the department of transportation and each county to: (A)  Scan any cat or dog carcass found on a state or county roadway for a microchip; (B)  Record certain information and report that information to the appropriate county animal services or animal service contractors; and (C)  Make reasonable efforts to contact the registered owner; and (2)  Authorize the department of transportation and each county to coordinate with each other to share scanner resources or protocols. SECTION 3.  Chapter 264, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§264-     Microchip scanning of deceased animals on roadways.  (a)  The department of transportation shall: (1)  Scan any cat or dog carcass found on a state roadway for a microchip; (2)  Record any microchip number or other identifying information and a basic description of the animal, if discernible; (3)  Notify the appropriate county animal services contractor or animal control agency within forty-eight hours of discovery; and (4)  When feasible, make reasonable efforts to contact the registered owner of a deceased animal if microchip information is obtained. (b) The department of transportation may coordinate with the counties to share microchip scanner resources or protocols as needed." SECTION 4.  Chapter 265A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§265A-     Microchip scanning of deceased animals on roadways.  (a)  Each county shall: (1)  Scan any cat or dog carcass found on a county roadway for a microchip; (2)  Record any microchip number or other identifying information and a basic description of the animal, if discernible; and (3)  Notify the appropriate county animal services contractor or animal control agency within forty-eight hours of discovery. (b) A county animal services contractor or animal control agency shall make reasonable efforts to contact the registered owner of a deceased animal if microchip information is obtained. (c) Each county may coordinate with the department of transportation or other counties to share scanner resources or protocols." SECTION 5.  New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 6.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval. Report Title: DOT; Deceased Pet Animals; Public Roadways; Microchips; Notification Description: Requires the Department of Transportation or appropriate county to scan any cat or dog carcass found on a state or county roadway for a microchip, record certain information, report that information to the appropriate county animal services or animal service contractors, and make reasonable efforts to contact the registered owner.  Authorizes the Department of Transportation and each county to coordinate with each other to share scanner resources or protocols.  (CD1) The summary description of legislation appearing on this page is for informational purposes only and is not legislation or evidence of legislative intent.
