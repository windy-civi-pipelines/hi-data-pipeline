HB756 HD2 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 756 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO HEALTH. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States. In Hawaii, tobacco use accounts for one thousand four hundred annual deaths and $526,000,000 in annual health care costs directly attributed to smoking related diseases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2014 "Best Practices for Comprehensive Tobacco Control Programs" guide.  Tobacco use is a serious public health problem in terms of the human suffering and loss of life it causes, and is a financial burden on society and our health care system. The legislature further finds that eighty-one per cent of youth who have ever used a tobacco product report that the first tobacco product they used was flavored.  Flavored tobacco products promote youth initiation of tobacco use and help young occasional smokers become daily smokers by reducing or masking the natural harshness and taste of tobacco smoke, thereby increasing the appeal of tobacco products. The legislature additionally finds that menthol, in particular, is used by the tobacco industry because it has a cooling and numbing effect and can reduce the throat irritation from smoking, thus making menthol cigarettes an appealing option for youth who are initiating tobacco use.  Candy and fruit flavors improve the taste and reduce the harshness of tobacco products, making them more appealing and easier for beginners to try tobacco products and ultimately become addicted.  The United States Surgeon General noted in the 2016 report titled "E-Cigarette Use Among Youth and Youth Adults" that "[b]ecause the adolescent brain is still developing, nicotine use during adolescence can disrupt the formation of brain circuits that control attention, learning, and susceptibility to addiction." Furthermore, delays in the United States Food and Drug Administration regulatory process of e-cigarettes have allowed the tobacco and electronic smoking device industries to significantly increase the marketing and production of electronic vaping devices.  According to a 2018 study published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research, the count of flavored tobacco products went from 7,764 in 2014 to 15,586 in 2017, a one hundred per cent increase.  Every year that passes youth become more exposed to the predatory practices of tobacco companies seeking a market for nicotine addiction.  Hawaii has experienced the heightened promotion of vape products that offer candy and local flavors designed to appeal to the State's youth, such as POG, apple mui, luau punch, rainbow candy, lava burst ice, Shaka strawberry, lychee ice, Molokai Hot Bread, and lilikoi lychee. Additionally, many of the packages are designed to look like candies popular with children, such as Jolly Ranchers and Sour Patch Kids. The legislature also finds that young people and people of color have high rates of use of flavored tobacco products, including menthol.  According to the 2023 Hawaii Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, among public high school students who are current cigarette smokers, an average of 14.1 per cent smoke menthol, and among public middle school students who are current cigarette smokers, an average of 7.1 smoke menthol. According to the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 63.7 per cent of adult smokers in Hawaii usually smoke menthol cigarettes. Furthermore, the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System shows that prevalence is high among specific ethnic groups with 70.8 per cent of Filipinos, 80.7 per cent of Native Hawaiians, and 66.9 per cent of Japanese usually smoking menthol cigarettes.  The 2021 National Youth Tobacco Survey report, estimates that ending the sale of flavored tobacco in Hawaii would save the State at least $48,000,000 in long-term health care costs, prevent seven hundred premature smoking-related deaths, prompt over three thousand menthol cigarette smokers to quit, and prevent youth from initiating smoking with menthol cigarettes. Given the significant threat to public health posed by flavored tobacco products, including those with menthol, seven states  California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Utah  and over three hundred ninety localities have enacted policies to end the sale of flavored tobacco products to some extent.  These laws now protect over twenty-five per cent of the United States' population.  Hawaii must also take steps to regulate these products to address the youth vaping epidemic and reduce tobacco-related health disparities. Of additional concern is the increased use of tobacco- and smoke-free oral nicotine pouches that come in different flavors and strengths.  These products are easier to conceal than cigarettes or vape products and may be used by youth who mistakenly believe that the lack of tobacco and smoke makes the product safer for consumption.  Furthermore, because these products do not contain tobacco, they can fall through the regulatory cracks, requiring a broader approach to addressing youth nicotine addiction. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to prohibit the sale of, offer for sale, or possess with the intent to sell or offer to sell, all flavored nicotine products and nicotine product flavor enhancers, including products with menthol, and prohibit the mislabeling of e-liquid products as nicotine-free. SECTION 2.  Chapter 321, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part    .  SALE OF FLAVORED Nicotine PRODUCTS PROHIBITED §321-A  Definitions.  As used in this part, unless the context otherwise requires: "Cigarette" has the same meaning as in section 245-1.
