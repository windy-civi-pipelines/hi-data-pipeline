Section 1:
HB486 HD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 486 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO TRANSPORTATION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that electric bicycles have become widely available for personal transportation and are popular among citizens of all ages.  In March 2023, there were five thousand three hundred registered electric bicycles.  This figure is potentially higher considering that many owners do not register their bikes, especially if they are purchased online. In December of 2023, the department of transportation reported nine bicyclist fatalities, the highest recorded number of deaths among bicyclists in Hawaii to date. Furthermore, electric bicycles can seriously injure pedestrians in a collision and operators are at risk from motorists who do not expect a small, silent, and motorized device riding near them. The legislature further finds that in the wake of a recent surge in ridership accidents, it is critical to address the unsafe operation of electric bicycles. The purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Prohibit the removal of a manufacturer- or factory-installed speed limiting device from an electric bicycle; and (2)  Require the department of transportation to develop a traffic safety education program and public awareness campaign to educate the public about general electric bicycle riding safety. SECTION 2.  Chapter 286, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part IV to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§286-     Speed limiting devices.  (a) No person shall: (1)  Remove a manufacturer- or factory-installed speed limiting device from an electric bicycle; or (2)  Operate an electric bicycle, in which the manufacturer- or factory-installed speed limiting device was removed. (b) For purposes of this section: "Electric bicycle" means a two- or three-wheeled cycle with fully operable pedals and an electric motor of less than seven hundred fifty watts that provides propulsion assistance.  "Electric bicycle" includes a low-speed electric bicycle, as defined in title 15 United States Code section 2085. "Speed limiting device" means a device or function in an electric bicycle capable of limiting the maximum motive power-controlled speed at which the electric bicycle may operate." SECTION 3.  No later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 2026, the department of transportation shall develop a traffic safety education program and public awareness campaign to educate the public about general electric bicycle riding safety, rules of the road, and laws pertaining to electric bicycles.  The department shall inform individuals of the applicable traffic code, safety information, and penalties for violations at the time of registering an electric bicycle. SECTION 4.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $ or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 for implementation and administration of the traffic safety education program and public awareness campaign required pursuant to section 3 of this Act. The sums appropriated shall be expended by the department of transportation for the purposes of this Act. SECTION 5.  This Act does not affect rights and duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, and proceedings that were begun before its effective date. SECTION 6.  New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 7.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 3000. Report Title: Electric Bicycles; Roadways; Speed Limiting Devices; Appropriation Description: Prohibits the removal of a manufacturer- or factory-installed speed limiting device from an electric bicycle.  Requires the Department of Transportation to develop a traffic safety education program and a public awareness campaign.  Appropriate funds.  Effective 7/1/3000.  (HD1) The summary description of legislation appearing on this page is for informational purposes only and is not legislation or evidence of legislative intent.
