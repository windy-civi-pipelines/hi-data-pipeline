SB1255 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1255 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT Relating to Government Records. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that transparency and accountability in government operations are fundamental to public trust.  The legislature also finds that public agencies in the State increasingly rely on private contractors to perform government functions, including creating, maintaining, or using records critical to public oversight.  The legislature believes it is critical to prevent the circumvention of public agencies' transparency obligations through the outsourcing of their government functions by ensuring that these records remain accessible under Hawaii's public records law, the Uniform Information Practices Act (UIPA). The purpose of this Act is to clarify that records created, received, maintained, or used by private contractors performing governmental functions on behalf of public agencies are subject to the UIPA. SECTION 2.  Chapter 92F, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding two new sections to part II to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§92F-A  Government Function Outsourcing Contracts; requirements.  (a) All government function outsourcing contracts shall include provisions that require: (1)  The contractor to: (A)  Comply with the government record disclosure requirements of this chapter; (B)  Maintain government records in accordance with retention schedules established under state law; and (C)  Designate a custodian of government records responsible for responding to requests for access to government records; and (2)  The contract to be terminated upon the determination of the office of information practices that the contractor violated the recordkeeping and disclosure requirements under this chapter. (b)  Any agency that enters into a government function outsourcing contract shall: (1)  Be responsible for ensuring compliance with this chapter by the agency and contractor, which shall include but not be limited to providing oversight of the contractor's recordkeeping and responses to requests for access to government records; and (2)  Make available on the agency's website a list of all government function outsourcing contracts entered into by the agency with an outline of the nature of services contracted and the government records subject to disclosure pursuant to this part. (c)  No contractor shall deny a request for access to government records on the basis of trade secret or other proprietary information except where specifically protected by law, as determined by the office of information practices. (d)  Each public agency that enters into a government function outsourcing contract shall submit an annual report of its findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular session, beginning with the regular session of 2026.  The reports shall include: (1)  All government function outsourcing contracts entered into by the agency during the preceding year; (2)  The type and volume of each of the government records created, received, maintained, or used by contractors; and (3)  A list of requests for access to government records received by the agency and contractor for contractor-held government records and their resolutions. (e)  For the purposes of this section: "Contractor" means a private person that enters into a government function outsourcing contract with an agency. "Government function" means a service, program, or activity that an agency is authorized or required by law to perform. "Government function outsourcing contract" means a contract or other agreement under which an agency delegates performance of a government function to a private person. "Trade secret" has the same meaning as defined in section 482B-2." §92F-B  Civil penalties.  (a)  Any contractor who violates the recordkeeping and disclosure requirements of this chapter as determined by the office of information practices, shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 for each violation, and the government function outsourcing contract shall be terminated.

SECTION 3. Section 92F-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending the definition of "government record" to read as follows: "Government record" means information maintained by an agency in written, auditory, visual, electronic, or other physical form.  "Government record" includes any information in written, auditory, visual, electronic, or other physical form that is created, received, maintained, or used by a private person in performance of a contract or other agreement with an agency, under which the agency delegates performance of a government function to the private person." SECTION 4.
