HB698 HD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 698 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO ANIMAL CRUELTY. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that animal cruelty offenders are a threat to the health and safety of all members of our communities, especially vulnerable populations. Recent research has shown that animal cruelty is a predictive and co‑occurring crime with violence against humans, including children, intimate partners, and the elderly.  Psychological studies show that seventy per cent of violent criminals began by abusing animals.  Children who witness animal abuse are also more likely to abuse animals as teenagers and adults. The legislature further finds that there has been a significant increase in animal cruelty cases in Hawaii over the past five years.  According to the Honolulu police department, there were seventy‑three animal cruelty crimes in 2023 compared to fifty eight in 2018. The prevalence of animal cruelty crimes in the State and its correlation with other serious violent crimes warrants increased penalties for offenders. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to amend the criminal penalties for various animal cruelty offenses by increasing the category of offense. SECTION 2.  Section 711-1108.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (5) to read as follows: "(5)  Cruelty to animals in the first degree [is] shall be a class [C] B felony.  In addition to any fines and imprisonment imposed under this section, any person convicted under this section shall be prohibited from possessing or owning any pet animal or equine animal for a minimum of five years from the date of conviction."

(3) Whenever any animal is so severely injured that there is no reasonable probability that its life or usefulness can be saved, the animal may be immediately destroyed without creating any offense under this section. (4) Cruelty to animals in the second degree [is] shall be a misdemeanor, except [that if the offense involves ten or more pet animals in any one instance, then cruelty to animals in the second degree is a class C felony.] as provided in subsection (5).
