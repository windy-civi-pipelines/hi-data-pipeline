2025-2467 HB698 SD1 SMA. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 698 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII S.D. 1 Proposed A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO ANIMAL CRUELTY. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that animal cruelty offenders are a threat to the health and safety of all members of our communities, especially vulnerable populations.  Recent research has shown that animal cruelty is a predictive and co‑occurring crime with violence against humans, including children, intimate partners, and the elderly. Psychological studies show that seventy per cent of violent criminals began by abusing animals.  Children who witness animal abuse are also more likely to abuse animals as teenagers and adults. The legislature also finds that there has been a significant increase in animal cruelty cases in the State over the past five years, especially cases involving pet animals.  According to the Honolulu police department, there were seventy-three animal cruelty crimes in 2023 compared to fifty-eight in 2018.  Inadequate punishment for these offenses has caused outrage in the community, leading to protests demanding that these crimes be taken more seriously. The legislature further finds that people have particularly deep bonds with pet animals.  In a 2024 survey conducted on Oʻahu by Ward Research, ninety-four per cent of all households agreed that animal companionship is important to quality of life.  Nationally, ninety-seven per cent of pet owners consider pets to be part of their family. The legislature concludes that the prevalence of animal cruelty crimes in the State and its correlation with other serious violent crimes warrants increased penalties for the most egregious offenses against pet animals.  Stronger penalties will help deter and prevent animal cruelty and ensure that those responsible face appropriate consequences. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to increase the criminal penalties for the offenses of cruelty to animals in the first and second degrees for situations that involve pet animals. SECTION 2.  Section 711-1108.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (5) to read as follows: "(5)  Cruelty to animals in the first degree [is] shall be a class C felony[.]; provided that if the offense involves a pet animal, cruelty to animals in the first degree shall be a class B felony.  In addition to any fines and imprisonment imposed under this section, any person convicted under this section shall be prohibited from possessing or owning any pet animal or equine animal for a minimum of five years from the date of conviction." SECTION 3.  Section 711-1109, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (4) to read as follows: "(4)  Cruelty to animals in the second degree [is] shall be a misdemeanor[, except]; provided that if the offense involves ten or more pet animals in any one instance[, then] or the death of a pet animal, cruelty to animals in the second degree [is] shall be a class [C] B felony.  In addition to any other penalties imposed, the person shall be prohibited from possessing or owning any pet animal for a minimum of five years from the date of conviction." SECTION 4.  This Act does not affect rights and duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, and proceedings that were begun before its effective date. SECTION 5.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 6.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval. Report Title: Penal Code; Animal Cruelty; Pet Animals; Penalties Description: Increases the criminal penalties for the offenses of cruelty to animals in the first and second degree that involve pet animals. (Proposed SD1) The summary description of legislation appearing on this page is for informational purposes only and is not legislation or evidence of legislative intent.
