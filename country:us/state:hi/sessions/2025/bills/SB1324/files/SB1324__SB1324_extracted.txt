Section 1:
SB1324 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1324 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO FIREWORKS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that improved enforcement of the fireworks control laws is necessary, not only to protect property from avoidable fire damage, but also to protect the community from fire- and explosion-related injuries, respiratory distress caused by the air pollution, and recurring trauma to afflicted persons due to loud explosions. The legislature further finds that a more robust continuum of enforcement mechanisms must be established to promote compliance with the fireworks control laws, including graduated penalties for repeat or felony level offenses, enhanced penalties for offenses that result in injury or death, and a dedicated adjudication system for fireworks infractions, similar to the existing traffic infraction system.  Creating a fireworks infractions system will allow law enforcement agencies and the judiciary to quickly and efficiently process low-level cases, while also allowing them to prioritize higher-level cases as appropriate. SECTION 2.  The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding to title 38 a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "CHAPTER ADJUDICATION OF FIREWORKS INFRACTIONS §   -1  Definitions.  As used in this chapter: "Concurrent trial" means a trial proceeding held in the district or family court in which the defendant is tried simultaneously in a civil case for any charged fireworks infraction and in a criminal case for any related criminal offense, with trials to be held in one court on the same date and at the same time. "Fireworks infraction" means any violation of chapter 132D, any rule adopted pursuant to chapter 132D, or any county ordinance or rule enacted pursuant to chapter 132D, for which the prescribed penalties do not include imprisonment and that are not otherwise specifically excluded from coverage of this chapter. "Hearing" means a proceeding conducted by the district court pursuant to section    -7 at which the defendant to whom a notice of infraction was issued either admits to the infraction, contests the infraction, or admits to the infraction but offers an explanation to mitigate the monetary assessment imposed. "Law enforcement officer" means any employee of any county, state, federal, or military agency authorized by law to issue a notice of infraction. "Notice of infraction" means the citation form that is issued to the defendant at or after the time of the fireworks infraction and notifies the defendant of the infraction the defendant is charged with committing. "Related criminal offense" means any criminal violation or crime, committed in the same course of conduct as a fireworks infraction, for which the defendant is arrested or charged. "Trial" means a trial conducted by the district court pursuant to the rules of the district court and the Hawaii rules of evidence. §   -2  Applicability.  (a)  All fireworks infractions, including fireworks infractions committed by minors, shall be adjudicated pursuant to this chapter, except as provided in subsection (b).  This chapter shall be applied uniformly throughout the State and in all counties.  No penal sanction that includes imprisonment shall apply to a violation of state statute or rule, or county ordinance or rule, that would constitute a fireworks infraction under this chapter.  No fireworks infraction shall be classified as a criminal offense. (b)  Where a defendant is charged with a fireworks infraction and the fireworks infraction is committed in the same course of conduct as a criminal offense for which the offender is arrested or charged, the fireworks infraction shall be adjudicated pursuant to this chapter; provided that the court may schedule any initial appearance, hearing, or trial on the fireworks infraction at the same date, time, and place as the arraignment, hearing, or trial on the related criminal offense. Notwithstanding this subsection or subsection (c), the court shall not schedule any initial appearance, hearing, or trial on the fireworks infraction at the same date, time, and place as the arraignment, hearing, or trial on the related criminal offense where the related criminal offense is a felony or is a misdemeanor for which the defendant has demanded a jury trial. (c)  If the defendant requests a trial pursuant to section    -11, the trial shall be held in the district court of the circuit in which the fireworks infraction was committed.  If the court schedules a concurrent trial pursuant to paragraph (1), the concurrent trial shall be held in the appropriate district or family court of the circuit in which the fireworks infraction was committed, whichever has jurisdiction over the related criminal offense charged pursuant to the applicable statute or rule of court; provided that: (1)  The district or family court, for the purpose of trial, may schedule a civil trial on the fireworks infraction on the same date and at the same time as a criminal trial on the related criminal offense charged.  The court shall enter a civil judgment as to the fireworks infraction and a judgment of conviction or acquittal as to the related criminal offense following the concurrent trial; and (2)  If the trial on the fireworks infraction is held separately from and before trial on any related criminal offense, the following shall be inadmissible in the prosecution or trial of the related criminal offense, except as expressly provided by the Hawaii rules of evidence: (A)  Any written or oral statement made by the defendant in proceedings conducted pursuant to section    -6(b); and (B)  Any testimony given by the defendant in the trial on the fireworks infraction. These statements or testimony shall not be deemed a waiver of the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination in connection with any related criminal offense. (d)  In no event shall section 701-109 preclude prosecution for a related criminal offense where a fireworks infraction committed in the same course of conduct has been adjudicated pursuant to this chapter. (e)  If the defendant fails to appear at any scheduled court date before the date of trial or concurrent trial and: (1)  The defendant's civil liability for the fireworks infraction has not yet been adjudicated pursuant to section    -7, the court shall enter a judgment by default in favor of the State for the fireworks infraction unless the court determines that good cause or excusable neglect exists for the defendant's failure to appear; or (2)  The defendant's civil liability for the fireworks infraction has been adjudicated previously pursuant to section    -7, the judgment earlier entered in favor of the State shall stand unless the court determines that good cause or excusable neglect exists for the defendant's failure to appear. (f)  If the defendant fails to appear at any scheduled court date prior to concurrent trial or fails to appear for concurrent trial scheduled pursuant to subsection (c)(1), the court shall enter a disposition pursuant to the Hawaii rules of penal procedure for the criminal offense. §   -3  Venue and jurisdiction.  (a)  All fireworks infractions shall be adjudicated in the district and circuit where the alleged infraction occurred, except as otherwise provided by law. (b)  Except as otherwise provided by law, jurisdiction is in the district court of the circuit where the alleged fireworks infraction occurred.  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, district court judges shall adjudicate fireworks infractions. §   -4  Notice of infraction; form; determination final unless contested.  (a)  The notice of infraction shall include the summons for the purposes of this chapter.  Whenever a notice of infraction is issued, and to the extent practicable, the defendant's signature, driver's license number or state identification number, current mailing address, and electronic mail address shall be included on the notice.  If the defendant refuses to sign the notice of infraction, or refuses to provide any other required information, the law enforcement officer shall record this refusal on the notice and issue the notice to the defendant.  Anyone to whom a notice of infraction is issued under this chapter need not be arraigned before the court, unless required by rule of the supreme court. (b)  The form for the notice of infraction shall be prescribed by rules of the district court, which shall be uniform throughout the State; provided that each judicial circuit may include differing statutory, rule, or ordinance provisions on its respective notice of infraction. (c)  A notice of infraction that is generated by the use of electronic equipment or that bears the electronically stored image of any defendant's signature, or both, shall be valid under this chapter. (d)  The notice of infraction shall include the following: (1)  A statement of the specific fireworks infraction for which the notice was issued; (2)  A brief statement of the facts; (3)  A statement of the total amount to be paid for each fireworks infraction, which amount shall include any fee, surcharge, or cost required by statute, ordinance, or rule, and any monetary assessment established pursuant to section    -8, to be paid by the defendant to whom the notice was issued, which shall be uniform throughout the State; (4)  A statement of the options provided in section    -5(b) for answering the notice and the procedures necessary to exercise the options; (5)  A statement that the defendant to whom the notice is issued shall answer, choosing one of the options specified in section    -5(b), within twenty-one days of issuance of the notice; (6)  A statement that failure to answer the notice within twenty-one days of issuance shall result in the entry of judgment by default for the State and may result in the assessment of a late penalty; (7)  A statement that, at a hearing requested to contest the notice, pursuant to section    -7, no law enforcement officer shall be present unless the defendant timely requests the court to have the law enforcement officer present, and that the standard of proof to be applied by the court is whether a preponderance of the evidence proves that the specified fireworks infraction was committed; (8)  A statement that, at a hearing requested for the purpose of explaining mitigating circumstances surrounding the commission of the fireworks infraction or in consideration of a written request for mitigation, the defendant shall be considered to have committed the fireworks infraction; (9)  A space in which the signature of the defendant to whom the notice of infraction was issued may be affixed; and (10)  The date, time, and place at which the defendant to whom the notice was issued shall appear in court, if the defendant is required by the notice to appear in person at the hearing. (e)  A citation shall not be dismissed for failure to include any information described in subsection (d). §   -5  Answer required.  (a)  A defendant who receives a notice of infraction shall answer the notice within twenty-one days of the date of issuance of the notice.  There shall be included with the notice of infraction a preaddressed envelope directed to the designated district court. (b)  Provided that the notice of infraction does not require an appearance in person at a hearing as set forth in section    -4(d)(10), in answering a notice of infraction, a defendant shall have the following options: (1)  Admit the commission of the fireworks infraction in one of the following ways: (A)  By mail or in person, by completing the appropriate portion of the notice of infraction or preaddressed envelope and submitting it to the authority specified on the notice together with payment of the total amount stated on the notice of infraction.  Payment by mail shall be in the form of a check, money order, or by an approved credit or debit card.  Payment in person shall be in the form of United States currency, check, money order, or by an approved credit or debit card; or (B)  Via the Internet or by telephone, by submitting payment of the total amount stated on the notice of infraction.  Payment via the Internet or by telephone shall be by an approved credit or debit card; (2)  Deny the commission of the fireworks infraction and request a hearing to contest the fireworks infraction by completing the appropriate portion of the notice of infraction or preaddressed envelope and submitting it, either by mail or in person, to the authority specified on the notice.  In lieu of appearing in person at a hearing, the defendant may submit a written statement of grounds on which the defendant contests the notice of infraction, which shall be considered by the court as a statement given in court pursuant to section    -6(b)(2); or (3)  Admit the commission of the fireworks infraction and request a hearing to explain circumstances mitigating the fireworks infraction by completing the appropriate portion of the notice of infraction or preaddressed envelope and submitting it, either by mail or in person, to the authority specified on the notice.  In lieu of appearing in person at a hearing, the defendant may submit a written explanation of the mitigating circumstances, which shall be considered by the court as a statement given in court pursuant to section    -6(c)(2). (c)  When answering the notice of infraction, the defendant shall affix the defendant's signature to the answer and shall state the address at which the defendant will accept future mailings from the court.  No other response shall constitute an answer for purposes of this chapter. §   -6  Court action after answer or failure to answer.  (a) When an admitting answer is received, the court shall enter judgment in favor of the State in the total amount specified in the notice of infraction. (b)  When a denying answer is received, the court shall proceed as follows: (1)  In the case of a fireworks infraction where the defendant requests a hearing at which the defendant will appear in person to contest the fireworks infraction, the court shall notify the defendant in writing of the date, time, and place of hearing to contest the notice of infraction.  The notice of hearing shall be mailed to the address stated in the denying answer, or if none was given, to the address stated on the notice of infraction.  If no address was provided, an electronic copy of the notice of hearing may be sent to the electronic mail address stated on the notice of infraction.  The notification shall also advise the defendant that, if the defendant fails to appear at the hearing, the court shall enter judgment by default in favor of the State, as of the date of the scheduled hearing, and that the total amount specified in the default judgment shall be paid within thirty days of entry of default judgment; and (2)  When a denying answer is accompanied by a written statement of the grounds on which the defendant contests the notice of infraction, the court shall proceed as provided in section    -7(a) and shall notify the defendant of its decision, including the total amount assessed, if any, by mailing the notice of entry of judgment within forty-five days of the postmarked date of the answer to the address provided by the defendant in the denying answer, or if none was given, to the address given when the notice of infraction was issued.  If no address was provided, an electronic copy of the notice of entry of judgment may be sent to the electronic mail address stated on the notice of infraction.  The notice of entry of judgment shall also advise the defendant, if it is determined that the fireworks infraction was committed and judgment is entered in favor of the State, that the defendant has the right, within thirty days of entry of judgment, to request a trial and shall specify the procedures for doing so.  The notice of entry of judgment shall also notify the defendant, if an amount is assessed by the court for monetary assessments, fees, surcharges, or costs, that if the defendant does not request a trial within the time specified in this paragraph, the total amount assessed shall be paid within thirty days of entry of judgment. (c)  When an answer admitting commission of the firework infraction but seeking to explain mitigating circumstances is received, the court shall proceed as follows: (1)  In the case of a fireworks infraction where the defendant requests a hearing at which the defendant will appear in person to explain mitigating circumstances, the court shall notify the defendant in writing of the date, time, and place of the hearing to explain mitigating circumstances.  The notice of hearing shall be mailed to the address stated in the answer, or if none was given, to the address stated on the notice of infraction.  If no address was provided, an electronic copy of the notice of hearing may be sent to the electronic mail address stated on the notice of infraction.  The notification shall also advise the defendant that, if the defendant fails to appear at the hearing, the court shall enter judgment by default in favor of the State, as of the date of the scheduled hearing, and that the total amount stated in the default judgment shall be paid within thirty days of entry of default judgment; and (2)  If a written explanation is included with an answer admitting commission of the fireworks infraction, the court shall enter judgment for the State and, after reviewing the explanation, determine the total amount of the monetary assessments, fees, surcharges, or costs to be assessed, if any.  The court shall then notify the defendant of the total amount to be paid for the fireworks infraction, if any.  There shall be no appeal from the judgment.  If the court assesses an amount for monetary assessments, fees, surcharges, or costs, the court shall also notify the defendant that the total amount shall be paid within thirty days of entry of judgment. (d)  If the defendant fails to answer within twenty-one days of issuance of the notice of infraction, the court shall take action as provided in subsection (e).

Thereafter, the court shall determine whether good cause or excusable neglect exists for the defendant's failure to take action necessary to prevent entry of judgment by default.  If so, the application to set aside default judgment shall be granted, the default judgment shall be set aside, and the notice of infraction shall be disposed of pursuant to this chapter.  If not, the application to set aside default judgment shall be denied, the appearance bond shall be forfeited and applied to satisfy amounts due under the default judgment, and the notice of infraction shall be finally disposed.  In either case, the court shall determine the existence of good cause or excusable neglect and notify the defendant of its decision on the application in writing. §   -7  Hearings.  (a)  In proceedings to contest a notice of infraction where the defendant to whom the notice was issued has timely requested a hearing and appears at the hearing: (1)  In lieu of the personal appearance by the law enforcement officer who issued the notice of infraction, the court shall consider the notice of infraction and any other relevant evidence, together with any oral or written statement by the defendant to whom the notice of infraction was issued; (2)  The court may compel by subpoena the attendance of the officer who issued the notice of fireworks infraction and other witnesses from whom it may wish to hear; (3)  The standard of proof to be applied by the court shall be whether, by a preponderance of the evidence, the court finds that the fireworks infraction was committed; and (4)  After due consideration of the evidence and arguments, if any, the court shall determine whether commission of the infraction has been established.  Where the commission of the fireworks infraction has not been established, judgment in favor of the defendant, dismissing the notice of infraction or any count therein with prejudice, shall be entered in the record. Where it has been established that the fireworks infraction was committed, the court shall enter judgment in favor of the State and shall assess a monetary assessment pursuant to section    -8, together with any fees, surcharges, or costs.  The court also shall inform the person of the right to request a trial pursuant to section    -11. If the person requests a trial at the time of the hearing, the court shall provide the person with the trial date as soon as practicable. (b)  In proceedings to explain mitigating circumstances where the person to whom the notice of infraction was issued has timely requested a hearing and appears at the hearing: (1)  The procedure shall be limited to the issue of mitigating circumstances.  A person who requests to explain the circumstances shall not be permitted to contest the notice of infraction; (2)  After the court has received the explanation, the court may enter judgment in favor of the State and may assess a monetary assessment pursuant to section -8, together with any fees, surcharges, or costs; (3)  The court, after receiving the explanation, may vacate the admission and enter judgment in favor of the defendant, dismissing the notice of infraction or any count therein with prejudice, where the explanation establishes that the infraction was not committed; and (4)  There shall be no appeal from the judgment. (c)  If a person, for whom a hearing has been scheduled to contest the notice of infraction or to explain mitigating circumstances, fails to appear at the hearing, the court shall enter judgment by default for the State and take action as provided in section    -6(e). §   -8  Monetary assessments.  (a)  A defendant found to have committed a fireworks infraction shall be assessed a monetary assessment not to exceed the maximum fine specified in the law or rule defining the fireworks infraction.  The court shall consider the defendant's financial circumstances, if disclosed, in determining the monetary assessment. (b)  In addition to any monetary assessment imposed for a fireworks infraction, the court may impose additional assessments for: (1)  Failure to pay a monetary assessment by the scheduled date of payment; and (2)  The cost of service of a penal summons issued pursuant to this chapter. (c)  In addition to any monetary assessment imposed for a fireworks infraction, the court shall impose administrative costs of $20 for each fireworks infraction in which judgment is entered in favor of the State.  The clerk of the district court shall deposit the administrative costs collected into the judiciary computer system special fund pursuant to section 601-3.7. (d)  Upon request of a defendant claiming inability to pay a monetary assessment, the court may grant an extension of the period in which the monetary assessment shall be paid or may impose community service in lieu thereof. (e)  At any point before full payment of a monetary assessment, any person who suffers a change in financial circumstances may request a hearing to modify the monetary assessment or to request community service in lieu thereof. §   -9  Time computation.  In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by this chapter, the day of the act, event, or default from which the period of time begins to run shall not be included.

SB1324 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1324 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO FIREWORKS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that improved enforcement of the fireworks control laws is necessary, not only to protect property from avoidable fire damage, but also to protect the community from fire- and explosion-related injuries, respiratory distress caused by the air pollution, and recurring trauma to afflicted persons due to loud explosions. The legislature further finds that a more robust continuum of enforcement mechanisms must be established to promote compliance with the fireworks control laws, including graduated penalties for repeat or felony level offenses, enhanced penalties for offenses that result in injury or death, and a dedicated adjudication system for fireworks infractions, similar to the existing traffic infraction system.  Creating a fireworks infractions system will allow law enforcement agencies and the judiciary to quickly and efficiently process low-level cases, while also allowing them to prioritize higher-level cases as appropriate. SECTION 2.  The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding to title 38 a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "CHAPTER ADJUDICATION OF FIREWORKS INFRACTIONS §   -1  Definitions.  As used in this chapter: "Concurrent trial" means a trial proceeding held in the district or family court in which the defendant is tried simultaneously in a civil case for any charged fireworks infraction and in a criminal case for any related criminal offense, with trials to be held in one court on the same date and at the same time. "Fireworks infraction" means any violation of chapter 132D, any rule adopted pursuant to chapter 132D, or any county ordinance or rule enacted pursuant to chapter 132D, for which the prescribed penalties do not include imprisonment and that are not otherwise specifically excluded from coverage of this chapter. "Hearing" means a proceeding conducted by the district court pursuant to section    -7 at which the defendant to whom a notice of infraction was issued either admits to the infraction, contests the infraction, or admits to the infraction but offers an explanation to mitigate the monetary assessment imposed. "Law enforcement officer" means any employee of any county, state, federal, or military agency authorized by law to issue a notice of infraction. "Notice of infraction" means the citation form that is issued to the defendant at or after the time of the fireworks infraction and notifies the defendant of the infraction the defendant is charged with committing. "Related criminal offense" means any criminal violation or crime, committed in the same course of conduct as a fireworks infraction, for which the defendant is arrested or charged. "Trial" means a trial conducted by the district court pursuant to the rules of the district court and the Hawaii rules of evidence. §   -2  Applicability.  (a)  All fireworks infractions, including fireworks infractions committed by minors, shall be adjudicated pursuant to this chapter, except as provided in subsection (b).  This chapter shall be applied uniformly throughout the State and in all counties.  No penal sanction that includes imprisonment shall apply to a violation of state statute or rule, or county ordinance or rule, that would constitute a fireworks infraction under this chapter.  No fireworks infraction shall be classified as a criminal offense. (b)  Where a defendant is charged with a fireworks infraction and the fireworks infraction is committed in the same course of conduct as a criminal offense for which the offender is arrested or charged, the fireworks infraction shall be adjudicated pursuant to this chapter; provided that the court may schedule any initial appearance, hearing, or trial on the fireworks infraction at the same date, time, and place as the arraignment, hearing, or trial on the related criminal offense. Notwithstanding this subsection or subsection (c), the court shall not schedule any initial appearance, hearing, or trial on the fireworks infraction at the same date, time, and place as the arraignment, hearing, or trial on the related criminal offense where the related criminal offense is a felony or is a misdemeanor for which the defendant has demanded a jury trial. (c)  If the defendant requests a trial pursuant to section    -11, the trial shall be held in the district court of the circuit in which the fireworks infraction was committed.  If the court schedules a concurrent trial pursuant to paragraph (1), the concurrent trial shall be held in the appropriate district or family court of the circuit in which the fireworks infraction was committed, whichever has jurisdiction over the related criminal offense charged pursuant to the applicable statute or rule of court; provided that: (1)  The district or family court, for the purpose of trial, may schedule a civil trial on the fireworks infraction on the same date and at the same time as a criminal trial on the related criminal offense charged.  The court shall enter a civil judgment as to the fireworks infraction and a judgment of conviction or acquittal as to the related criminal offense following the concurrent trial; and (2)  If the trial on the fireworks infraction is held separately from and before trial on any related criminal offense, the following shall be inadmissible in the prosecution or trial of the related criminal offense, except as expressly provided by the Hawaii rules of evidence: (A)  Any written or oral statement made by the defendant in proceedings conducted pursuant to section    -6(b); and (B)  Any testimony given by the defendant in the trial on the fireworks infraction. These statements or testimony shall not be deemed a waiver of the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination in connection with any related criminal offense. (d)  In no event shall section 701-109 preclude prosecution for a related criminal offense where a fireworks infraction committed in the same course of conduct has been adjudicated pursuant to this chapter. (e)  If the defendant fails to appear at any scheduled court date before the date of trial or concurrent trial and: (1)  The defendant's civil liability for the fireworks infraction has not yet been adjudicated pursuant to section    -7, the court shall enter a judgment by default in favor of the State for the fireworks infraction unless the court determines that good cause or excusable neglect exists for the defendant's failure to appear; or (2)  The defendant's civil liability for the fireworks infraction has been adjudicated previously pursuant to section    -7, the judgment earlier entered in favor of the State shall stand unless the court determines that good cause or excusable neglect exists for the defendant's failure to appear. (f)  If the defendant fails to appear at any scheduled court date prior to concurrent trial or fails to appear for concurrent trial scheduled pursuant to subsection (c)(1), the court shall enter a disposition pursuant to the Hawaii rules of penal procedure for the criminal offense. §   -3  Venue and jurisdiction.  (a)  All fireworks infractions shall be adjudicated in the district and circuit where the alleged infraction occurred, except as otherwise provided by law. (b)  Except as otherwise provided by law, jurisdiction is in the district court of the circuit where the alleged fireworks infraction occurred.  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, district court judges shall adjudicate fireworks infractions. §   -4  Notice of infraction; form; determination final unless contested.  (a)  The notice of infraction shall include the summons for the purposes of this chapter.  Whenever a notice of infraction is issued, and to the extent practicable, the defendant's signature, driver's license number or state identification number, current mailing address, and electronic mail address shall be included on the notice.  If the defendant refuses to sign the notice of infraction, or refuses to provide any other required information, the law enforcement officer shall record this refusal on the notice and issue the notice to the defendant.  Anyone to whom a notice of infraction is issued under this chapter need not be arraigned before the court, unless required by rule of the supreme court. (b)  The form for the notice of infraction shall be prescribed by rules of the district court, which shall be uniform throughout the State; provided that each judicial circuit may include differing statutory, rule, or ordinance provisions on its respective notice of infraction. (c)  A notice of infraction that is generated by the use of electronic equipment or that bears the electronically stored image of any defendant's signature, or both, shall be valid under this chapter. (d)  The notice of infraction shall include the following: (1)  A statement of the specific fireworks infraction for which the notice was issued; (2)  A brief statement of the facts; (3)  A statement of the total amount to be paid for each fireworks infraction, which amount shall include any fee, surcharge, or cost required by statute, ordinance, or rule, and any monetary assessment established pursuant to section    -8, to be paid by the defendant to whom the notice was issued, which shall be uniform throughout the State; (4)  A statement of the options provided in section    -5(b) for answering the notice and the procedures necessary to exercise the options; (5)  A statement that the defendant to whom the notice is issued shall answer, choosing one of the options specified in section    -5(b), within twenty-one days of issuance of the notice; (6)  A statement that failure to answer the notice within twenty-one days of issuance shall result in the entry of judgment by default for the State and may result in the assessment of a late penalty; (7)  A statement that, at a hearing requested to contest the notice, pursuant to section    -7, no law enforcement officer shall be present unless the defendant timely requests the court to have the law enforcement officer present, and that the standard of proof to be applied by the court is whether a preponderance of the evidence proves that the specified fireworks infraction was committed; (8)  A statement that, at a hearing requested for the purpose of explaining mitigating circumstances surrounding the commission of the fireworks infraction or in consideration of a written request for mitigation, the defendant shall be considered to have committed the fireworks infraction; (9)  A space in which the signature of the defendant to whom the notice of infraction was issued may be affixed; and (10)  The date, time, and place at which the defendant to whom the notice was issued shall appear in court, if the defendant is required by the notice to appear in person at the hearing. (e)  A citation shall not be dismissed for failure to include any information described in subsection (d). §   -5  Answer required.  (a)  A defendant who receives a notice of infraction shall answer the notice within twenty-one days of the date of issuance of the notice.  There shall be included with the notice of infraction a preaddressed envelope directed to the designated district court. (b)  Provided that the notice of infraction does not require an appearance in person at a hearing as set forth in section    -4(d)(10), in answering a notice of infraction, a defendant shall have the following options: (1)  Admit the commission of the fireworks infraction in one of the following ways: (A)  By mail or in person, by completing the appropriate portion of the notice of infraction or preaddressed envelope and submitting it to the authority specified on the notice together with payment of the total amount stated on the notice of infraction.  Payment by mail shall be in the form of a check, money order, or by an approved credit or debit card.  Payment in person shall be in the form of United States currency, check, money order, or by an approved credit or debit card; or (B)  Via the Internet or by telephone, by submitting payment of the total amount stated on the notice of infraction.  Payment via the Internet or by telephone shall be by an approved credit or debit card; (2)  Deny the commission of the fireworks infraction and request a hearing to contest the fireworks infraction by completing the appropriate portion of the notice of infraction or preaddressed envelope and submitting it, either by mail or in person, to the authority specified on the notice.  In lieu of appearing in person at a hearing, the defendant may submit a written statement of grounds on which the defendant contests the notice of infraction, which shall be considered by the court as a statement given in court pursuant to section    -6(b)(2); or (3)  Admit the commission of the fireworks infraction and request a hearing to explain circumstances mitigating the fireworks infraction by completing the appropriate portion of the notice of infraction or preaddressed envelope and submitting it, either by mail or in person, to the authority specified on the notice.  In lieu of appearing in person at a hearing, the defendant may submit a written explanation of the mitigating circumstances, which shall be considered by the court as a statement given in court pursuant to section    -6(c)(2). (c)  When answering the notice of infraction, the defendant shall affix the defendant's signature to the answer and shall state the address at which the defendant will accept future mailings from the court.  No other response shall constitute an answer for purposes of this chapter. §   -6  Court action after answer or failure to answer.  (a) When an admitting answer is received, the court shall enter judgment in favor of the State in the total amount specified in the notice of infraction. (b)  When a denying answer is received, the court shall proceed as follows: (1)  In the case of a fireworks infraction where the defendant requests a hearing at which the defendant will appear in person to contest the fireworks infraction, the court shall notify the defendant in writing of the date, time, and place of hearing to contest the notice of infraction.  The notice of hearing shall be mailed to the address stated in the denying answer, or if none was given, to the address stated on the notice of infraction.  If no address was provided, an electronic copy of the notice of hearing may be sent to the electronic mail address stated on the notice of infraction.  The notification shall also advise the defendant that, if the defendant fails to appear at the hearing, the court shall enter judgment by default in favor of the State, as of the date of the scheduled hearing, and that the total amount specified in the default judgment shall be paid within thirty days of entry of default judgment; and (2)  When a denying answer is accompanied by a written statement of the grounds on which the defendant contests the notice of infraction, the court shall proceed as provided in section    -7(a) and shall notify the defendant of its decision, including the total amount assessed, if any, by mailing the notice of entry of judgment within forty-five days of the postmarked date of the answer to the address provided by the defendant in the denying answer, or if none was given, to the address given when the notice of infraction was issued.  If no address was provided, an electronic copy of the notice of entry of judgment may be sent to the electronic mail address stated on the notice of infraction.  The notice of entry of judgment shall also advise the defendant, if it is determined that the fireworks infraction was committed and judgment is entered in favor of the State, that the defendant has the right, within thirty days of entry of judgment, to request a trial and shall specify the procedures for doing so.  The notice of entry of judgment shall also notify the defendant, if an amount is assessed by the court for monetary assessments, fees, surcharges, or costs, that if the defendant does not request a trial within the time specified in this paragraph, the total amount assessed shall be paid within thirty days of entry of judgment. (c)  When an answer admitting commission of the firework infraction but seeking to explain mitigating circumstances is received, the court shall proceed as follows: (1)  In the case of a fireworks infraction where the defendant requests a hearing at which the defendant will appear in person to explain mitigating circumstances, the court shall notify the defendant in writing of the date, time, and place of the hearing to explain mitigating circumstances.  The notice of hearing shall be mailed to the address stated in the answer, or if none was given, to the address stated on the notice of infraction.  If no address was provided, an electronic copy of the notice of hearing may be sent to the electronic mail address stated on the notice of infraction.  The notification shall also advise the defendant that, if the defendant fails to appear at the hearing, the court shall enter judgment by default in favor of the State, as of the date of the scheduled hearing, and that the total amount stated in the default judgment shall be paid within thirty days of entry of default judgment; and (2)  If a written explanation is included with an answer admitting commission of the fireworks infraction, the court shall enter judgment for the State and, after reviewing the explanation, determine the total amount of the monetary assessments, fees, surcharges, or costs to be assessed, if any.  The court shall then notify the defendant of the total amount to be paid for the fireworks infraction, if any.  There shall be no appeal from the judgment.  If the court assesses an amount for monetary assessments, fees, surcharges, or costs, the court shall also notify the defendant that the total amount shall be paid within thirty days of entry of judgment. (d)  If the defendant fails to answer within twenty-one days of issuance of the notice of infraction, the court shall take action as provided in subsection (e).

Thereafter, the court shall determine whether good cause or excusable neglect exists for the defendant's failure to take action necessary to prevent entry of judgment by default.  If so, the application to set aside default judgment shall be granted, the default judgment shall be set aside, and the notice of infraction shall be disposed of pursuant to this chapter.  If not, the application to set aside default judgment shall be denied, the appearance bond shall be forfeited and applied to satisfy amounts due under the default judgment, and the notice of infraction shall be finally disposed.  In either case, the court shall determine the existence of good cause or excusable neglect and notify the defendant of its decision on the application in writing. §   -7  Hearings.  (a)  In proceedings to contest a notice of infraction where the defendant to whom the notice was issued has timely requested a hearing and appears at the hearing: (1)  In lieu of the personal appearance by the law enforcement officer who issued the notice of infraction, the court shall consider the notice of infraction and any other relevant evidence, together with any oral or written statement by the defendant to whom the notice of infraction was issued; (2)  The court may compel by subpoena the attendance of the officer who issued the notice of fireworks infraction and other witnesses from whom it may wish to hear; (3)  The standard of proof to be applied by the court shall be whether, by a preponderance of the evidence, the court finds that the fireworks infraction was committed; and (4)  After due consideration of the evidence and arguments, if any, the court shall determine whether commission of the infraction has been established.  Where the commission of the fireworks infraction has not been established, judgment in favor of the defendant, dismissing the notice of infraction or any count therein with prejudice, shall be entered in the record. Where it has been established that the fireworks infraction was committed, the court shall enter judgment in favor of the State and shall assess a monetary assessment pursuant to section    -8, together with any fees, surcharges, or costs.  The court also shall inform the person of the right to request a trial pursuant to section    -11. If the person requests a trial at the time of the hearing, the court shall provide the person with the trial date as soon as practicable. (b)  In proceedings to explain mitigating circumstances where the person to whom the notice of infraction was issued has timely requested a hearing and appears at the hearing: (1)  The procedure shall be limited to the issue of mitigating circumstances.  A person who requests to explain the circumstances shall not be permitted to contest the notice of infraction; (2)  After the court has received the explanation, the court may enter judgment in favor of the State and may assess a monetary assessment pursuant to section -8, together with any fees, surcharges, or costs; (3)  The court, after receiving the explanation, may vacate the admission and enter judgment in favor of the defendant, dismissing the notice of infraction or any count therein with prejudice, where the explanation establishes that the infraction was not committed; and (4)  There shall be no appeal from the judgment. (c)  If a person, for whom a hearing has been scheduled to contest the notice of infraction or to explain mitigating circumstances, fails to appear at the hearing, the court shall enter judgment by default for the State and take action as provided in section    -6(e). §   -8  Monetary assessments.  (a)  A defendant found to have committed a fireworks infraction shall be assessed a monetary assessment not to exceed the maximum fine specified in the law or rule defining the fireworks infraction.  The court shall consider the defendant's financial circumstances, if disclosed, in determining the monetary assessment. (b)  In addition to any monetary assessment imposed for a fireworks infraction, the court may impose additional assessments for: (1)  Failure to pay a monetary assessment by the scheduled date of payment; and (2)  The cost of service of a penal summons issued pursuant to this chapter. (c)  In addition to any monetary assessment imposed for a fireworks infraction, the court shall impose administrative costs of $20 for each fireworks infraction in which judgment is entered in favor of the State.  The clerk of the district court shall deposit the administrative costs collected into the judiciary computer system special fund pursuant to section 601-3.7. (d)  Upon request of a defendant claiming inability to pay a monetary assessment, the court may grant an extension of the period in which the monetary assessment shall be paid or may impose community service in lieu thereof. (e)  At any point before full payment of a monetary assessment, any person who suffers a change in financial circumstances may request a hearing to modify the monetary assessment or to request community service in lieu thereof. §   -9  Time computation.  In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by this chapter, the day of the act, event, or default from which the period of time begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or state holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or state holiday. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and state holidays shall be included.
