SCR151 THE SENATE S.C.R. NO. 151 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE AUDITOR TO ASSESS THE SOCIAL AND FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF MANDATING HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR HEARING AIDS. WHEREAS, according to the National Institutes of Health, about one-third of Americans between the ages of sixty-five and seventy-five, and approximately one-half of those older than seventy-five, have some degree of hearing loss; and WHEREAS, one digital hearing aid can cost $3,000 or more, and because about fifty percent of childhood hearing loss is due to genetic causes, more than one member in a family may need to wear hearing aids, thereby multiplying the financial burden of purchasing hearing aids; and WHEREAS, while most health insurance plans in Hawaii cover the purchase of hearing aids, the amount of coverage may be low, leaving the patient with a large copayment; and WHEREAS, it is not unusual for people with hearing loss to choose to delay or forgo the purchase of hearing aids because they are unable to pay for them; and WHEREAS, pursuant to section 23-51, Hawaii Revised Statutes, before any legislative measure that mandates health insurance coverage for specific health services, specific diseases, or certain providers of health care services as part of individual or group health insurance policies can be considered, there shall be a concurrent resolution passed that designates a specific legislative measure for the Auditor to review and on which to prepare a report for submission to the Legislature that assesses both the social and financial effects of the proposed mandated coverage; and WHEREAS, the Legislature adopted S.C.R. No. 34, S.D. 1 (2014), which requested the Auditor to assess the social and financial effects of mandating health insurance coverage for hearing aids, as proposed in S.B. No. 309, S.D. 1 (2014); and WHEREAS, pursuant to Report No. 14-10, dated October 2014, the Auditor determined that S.B. No. 309, S.D. 1 (2014), lacked certain coverage parameters, including the frequency for replacement or costs to be covered by insurers for hearing aids; and WHEREAS, in response to the Auditor's report, S.B. No. 2439, S.D. 2 (2022)(S.B. No. 2439), proposed a minimum coverage benefit of $1,500 per hearing aid for each hearing-impaired ear every thirty-six months; and WHEREAS, the Legislature adopted S.C.R. No. 61, S.D. 1, H.D. 1 (2022), which requested the Auditor to perform a social and financial assessment of mandatory health insurance coverage for hearing aids as proposed in S.B. No. 2439, as required by section 23-51, Hawaii Revised Statutes; and WHEREAS, the Office of the Auditor ceased work on its assessment of S.B. No. 2439, pursuant to communication from the Legislature's Kupuna Caucus that the assessment was unnecessary; and WHEREAS, relevant stakeholders, including the legislator who introduced the measure or the Deaf and Blind Task Force, were not consulted on the reasoning for the Auditor's ceasing work on the assessment of S.B. No. 2439; and WHEREAS, S.B. No. 1494, introduced during the Regular Session of 2025, contains specific coverage parameters that requires health insurers, mutual benefit societies, and health maintenance organizations to provide coverage for hearing aids, subject to a minimum benefit of $1,500 per hearing-impaired ear every thirty-six months; and WHEREAS, pursuant to section 23-51, Hawaii Revised Statutes, an updated social and financial assessment by the Auditor analyzing the specific, mandatory health insurance coverage parameters proposed in S.B. No. 1494, Regular Session of 2025, is warranted; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, the House of Representatives concurring, that the Auditor is requested to conduct an assessment, pursuant to sections 23-51 and 23-52, Hawaii Revised Statutes, of the social and financial effects of mandating health insurance coverage for hearing aids, as proposed in S.B.
