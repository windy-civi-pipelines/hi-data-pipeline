STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS TO HOUSE BILL NO. 796
Honorable Members
Thirty-Third Legislature
State of Hawaii
Pursuant to Section 16 of Article III of the Constitution of the State of
Hawaii, I am returning herewith, without my approval. House Bill No. 796, entitled "A Bill
for an Act Relating to Tax Credits."
The purpose of this bill is to require that all tax credits either in existence
on December 31, 2025, or established or renewed after that date, either include a five-
year sunset date or be subject to an annual one-third reduction in credit amount. This
annual reduction will take place over a three-year period, beginning in the sixth year of
the credit after December 31, 2025.
This bill is objectionable because it would have a deleterious long-term
impact on income tax credits across a variety of important industries, including film and
television, research, and renewable energy. These tax credits are critical to supporting
economic development and diversification, particularly within growing and emerging
sectors. Categorically sunsetting income tax credits will not only disincentivize future
investors from doing business in Hawaii but will also destabilize existing businesses
that currently rely upon these tax credits.
For the foregoing reasons, I am returning House Bill No. 796 without my
approval.
Respectfully,
Josh green, m.d.
Governor of Hawaii
