Section 1:
HB568 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 568 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to office of legislative analyst. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that numerous states incorporate fiscal notes into their legislative process, which increase public transparency by disclosing the potential financial impact a measure would have on the state and local government.  The Council of State Governments reports that forty-four states include "projected future cost" in their bill notes.  Some states require fiscal notes in their house rules, while others require them in statute.  In contrast, Hawaii does not require fiscal notes to accompany measures during the legislative process.  Therefore, representatives and senators are forced to vote on measures without knowing the financial impact of their decisions.  The purpose of this Act is to require the office of legislative analyst to produce fiscal notes on all fiscal bills. SECTION 2.  Section 21F-6, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "[[]§21F-6[]]  Office of the legislative analyst established. (a)  There is established the office of the legislative analyst [to be administered by the committee].  The [committee] legislature, by a majority vote of each house in joint session, shall appoint a legislative analyst who shall serve for a period of four years.  The [committee, by a three-fourths vote of its members,] legislature, by a majority vote of each house in joint session, may remove the legislative analyst from office, but only for cause.  [The committee shall fix the salary of the legislative analyst.] The salary of the legislative analyst shall be the same as the salary of the director of the legislative reference bureau. (b) The legislative analyst may employ [other clerical and technical employees] a first assistant and other employees as may be necessary to carry out the functions of the office. The legislative analyst, first assistant and other [clerical and technical] employees shall be entitled to participate in any employee benefit program plan or privilege generally available to state employees." SECTION 3.  Section 21F-7, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "[[]§21F-7[]]  General purposes of analyst.  (a)  The purpose of the office of the legislative analyst shall be: (1)  To provide the legislature with research and analysis of current and projected state revenues and expenditures; (2)  To provide the legislature with a report analyzing the governor's proposed levels of revenue and expenditures for biennial budgets submitted under chapter 37 as well as other supplemental budget submittals to the legislature by the governor; (3)  To provide an analysis of the impact of the governor's proposed revenue and expenditure plans for the next biennium; (4)  To conduct research matters of economic and fiscal policy and to report to the legislature on the result of the research; (5)  To provide economic reports and studies on the state of the State's economy, including trends and forecasts for consideration by the legislature; (6)  To conduct budget and tax studies and provide general fiscal and budgetary information; (7)  To review and make recommendations on the operation of state programs in order to appraise the implementation of state laws regarding the expenditure of funds and to recommend means of improving their efficiency; [and] (8)  To recommend to the legislature changes in the mix of revenue sources for programs, in the percentage of state expenditures devoted to major programs, and in the role of the legislature in overseeing state government expenditures and revenue projections[.]; and (9)  To prepare a fiscal note to accompany each fiscal bill before the measure is recommended for passage by each house committee or senate committee of the legislature to which the measure is referred.
