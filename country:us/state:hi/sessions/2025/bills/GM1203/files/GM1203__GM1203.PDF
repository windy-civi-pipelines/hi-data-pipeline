THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII S.D. 1
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO THE ENVIRONMENT.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that solid waste may soon
2 exceed landfill capacity in all of the State's counties. Most
3 waste created in the State is landfilled or incinerated, which
4 places the burden for managing waste on taxpayers, is costly,
5 and creates pollution that is harmful to residents and the
6 environment. Landfills discharge leachate, a highly toxic fluid
7 that has the potential for leakage that can cause harm to
8 surrounding communities and nearshore and marine environments
9 downslope. The Waimanalo gulch landfill on Oahu produces around
10 nine thousand eight hundred gallons of leachate per day. Waste
11 that is incinerated produces air pollutants and toxic ash; this
12 toxic ash is often buried in landfills. On Oahu, more than four
13 hundred tons of toxic ash are buried in the landfill every day.
14 The legislature finds that the State will benefit from reduced
15 waste production by expanding alternative strategies like reuse,
16 refill, composting, and recycling.

C.D. 1
1 The legislature further finds that extended producer
2 responsibility is a market-based, circular economy that
3 encourages alternative waste management strategies as well as
4 product design innovations that lead to source reduction of
5 waste. Extended producer responsibility programs shift
6 responsibility for a product's lifecycle, including end-of-life
7 management, from consumers or governments to producers of the
8 product. This encourages sustainable product design that leads
9 to less waste and more fully recyclable or reusable products and
10 packaging. Extended producer responsibility programs also
11 typically reduce the financial burden on government for waste
12 management and lead to better recycling services for residents.
13 Furthermore, these programs help create local jobs by expanding
14 collection services, local processing of waste, and reuse and
15 refill programs.
16 The legislature finds that extended producer responsibility
17 strategies can be applied to packaging waste as well. Packaging
18 waste is a large part of the waste stream and includes
19 containers for food products, cleaning products, and personal
20 care products, as well as waste associated with shipping and
21 transporting products. Extended producer responsibility

1 programs for packaging waste exist in Asia, Europe, Canada, and
2 five states across the United States. Furthermore, several
3 other states are in the process of implementing programs by
4 funding needs assessments, a necessary preliminary step to
5 inform the development of an extended producer responsibility
6 program.
7 The purpose of this Act is to require and appropriate funds
8 for the department of health to conduct a statewide needs
9 assessment and establish an advisory council with relevant
10 stakeholders to determine what would be needed to transition to
11 a more circular system with less waste generation and more
12 reuse, and the necessary infrastructure to sort and locally
13 process recyclable materials through an extended producer
14 responsibility program for packaging materials and paper
15 products.
16 SECTION 2. (a) The department of health shall conduct a
17 statewide needs assessment to determine what will be needed to
18 reduce waste generation, increase reuse, improve collection
19 services, and expand local processing of materials through an
20 extended producer responsibility program for packaging materials
21 and paper products.
