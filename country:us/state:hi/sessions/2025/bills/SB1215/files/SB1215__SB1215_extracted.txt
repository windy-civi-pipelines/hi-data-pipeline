Section 1:
SB1215 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1215 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO the transient ACCOMMODATIONs tax. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1. The legislature finds that Hawaii's natural resources, including reefs, oceans, forests, streams, estuaries, shorelines, and beaches, provide irreplaceable and invaluable benefits to visitors, residents, and the global community. The Hawaii State Constitution makes clear that the State's natural and cultural resources are required to be held in public trust, and therefore, must be managed and protected for the benefit of present and future generations.  The Hawaii State Constitution further requires the State and its agencies to protect and enforce Native Hawaiian rights, including traditional and customary practices associated with, and dependent upon, carefully managed and abundant natural resources. The legislature further finds that Hawaii's natural environment faces significant environmental pressure from the heavy use it receives from persons traveling to enjoy the State's natural resources.  The current underinvestment in the State's natural resources poses a significant liability to the visitor industry; the stability of natural systems, including food systems and water quality; and the ecosystems, services, fisheries, economic resilience, and health and safety of the State. The legislature notes that the visitor industry is critically important for the State's economy.  In 2019, the visitor industry brought in $17.75 billion in total visitor spending to businesses in Hawaii, generated $2.07 billion in taxes, and supported 216,000 jobs statewide. The legislature asserts that the visitor industry should be provided with resources to improve the quality of the visitor experience to sustain the economic benefits to Hawaii, and equally importantly, to synergize tourism with the quality of life for Hawaii's residents.  The visitor industry should move toward regenerative tourism by attracting responsible visitors and implementing solutions to overcrowded attractions and overtaxed infrastructure. Tourism should be environmentally friendly, culturally sensitive, and synergistic with a high quality of life for the State's residents. The beaches of Waikiki provide an example of resources needed to improve the quality of visitor experience.  Waikiki is recognized as Hawaii's primary visitor destination.  In 2018, the Hawaii Tourism Authority found that Waikiki accounts for ninety per cent of all visitor accommodation units on Oahu and nearly half of all units in the State.  Sand beaches are extremely important to the quality of visitor experience.  In 2008, Hospitality Advisors LLC found that more than ninety per cent of visitors considered beach availability in Waikiki as very important or somewhat important.  Sea level rise constitutes a serious threat to the beaches of Waikiki.  The Waikiki beach improvement and maintenance program seeks to restore and improve Waikiki public beaches, increase beach stability through improvement and maintenance of shoreline structures, providing safe access to and along the shoreline and increase resilience to coastal hazards and sea level rise. Hawaii residents currently contribute to the protection and management of the State's natural resources through taxes, environmental care, subsistence, cultural practices, and the exercise of the values and practices embodied in the Hawaii State Constitution.  However, with escalating visitor impacts and an increasing global threat to the island ecosystems, there is an immediate need for additional resources to protect, restore, sustain, manage, and conserve Hawaii's natural resources.  A regenerative tourism contribution has been suggested by the Hawaii tourism authority as a means to obtain the necessary resources. The legislature believes that a one per cent transient accommodations tax (TAT) increase is necessary to provide the visitor industry with resources to improve visitor experience to sustain the economic benefits to Hawaii.  This one per cent TAT increase could generate the necessary funding each year to offset the adverse impacts of visitors and conserve Hawaii's irreplaceable green infrastructure in perpetuity. The legislature further finds that a malama aina visitor impact tax is a type of "green tax" or "environmental protection tax", which have been successfully implemented in many visitor destinations throughout the world, including the European Union, Galapagos Islands, Japan, New Zealand, and Palau.  In these locations, the taxes have demonstrated compounding benefits for visitors, residents, and natural landscapes and seascapes. The legislature believes that establishing a malama aina visitor impact tax as a one per cent increase in the TAT in Hawaii would be a significant and effective way to raise additional revenue to offset visitor impacts and ensure a healthy environment for future generations. A malama aina visitor impact tax provides a reasonable and appropriate way to generate these needed revenues. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Establish a malama aina visitor impact tax program, to be administered by the department of business, economic development, and tourism; (2)  Establish a malama aina visitor impact tax special fund to fund the malama aina visitor impact tax program; and (3)  Temporarily increase the transient accommodations tax by one per cent and deposit the additional tax revenue into the malama aina visitor impact tax special fund. SECTION 2. Chapter 201, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part .  MALAMA AINA VISITOR IMPACT TAX PROGRAM §201-A Definitions.  For purposes of this part: "Department" means the department of business, economic development, and tourism.

SB1215 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1215 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO the transient ACCOMMODATIONs tax. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1. The legislature finds that Hawaii's natural resources, including reefs, oceans, forests, streams, estuaries, shorelines, and beaches, provide irreplaceable and invaluable benefits to visitors, residents, and the global community. The Hawaii State Constitution makes clear that the State's natural and cultural resources are required to be held in public trust, and therefore, must be managed and protected for the benefit of present and future generations.  The Hawaii State Constitution further requires the State and its agencies to protect and enforce Native Hawaiian rights, including traditional and customary practices associated with, and dependent upon, carefully managed and abundant natural resources. The legislature further finds that Hawaii's natural environment faces significant environmental pressure from the heavy use it receives from persons traveling to enjoy the State's natural resources.  The current underinvestment in the State's natural resources poses a significant liability to the visitor industry; the stability of natural systems, including food systems and water quality; and the ecosystems, services, fisheries, economic resilience, and health and safety of the State. The legislature notes that the visitor industry is critically important for the State's economy.  In 2019, the visitor industry brought in $17.75 billion in total visitor spending to businesses in Hawaii, generated $2.07 billion in taxes, and supported 216,000 jobs statewide. The legislature asserts that the visitor industry should be provided with resources to improve the quality of the visitor experience to sustain the economic benefits to Hawaii, and equally importantly, to synergize tourism with the quality of life for Hawaii's residents.  The visitor industry should move toward regenerative tourism by attracting responsible visitors and implementing solutions to overcrowded attractions and overtaxed infrastructure. Tourism should be environmentally friendly, culturally sensitive, and synergistic with a high quality of life for the State's residents. The beaches of Waikiki provide an example of resources needed to improve the quality of visitor experience.  Waikiki is recognized as Hawaii's primary visitor destination.  In 2018, the Hawaii Tourism Authority found that Waikiki accounts for ninety per cent of all visitor accommodation units on Oahu and nearly half of all units in the State.  Sand beaches are extremely important to the quality of visitor experience.  In 2008, Hospitality Advisors LLC found that more than ninety per cent of visitors considered beach availability in Waikiki as very important or somewhat important.  Sea level rise constitutes a serious threat to the beaches of Waikiki.  The Waikiki beach improvement and maintenance program seeks to restore and improve Waikiki public beaches, increase beach stability through improvement and maintenance of shoreline structures, providing safe access to and along the shoreline and increase resilience to coastal hazards and sea level rise. Hawaii residents currently contribute to the protection and management of the State's natural resources through taxes, environmental care, subsistence, cultural practices, and the exercise of the values and practices embodied in the Hawaii State Constitution.  However, with escalating visitor impacts and an increasing global threat to the island ecosystems, there is an immediate need for additional resources to protect, restore, sustain, manage, and conserve Hawaii's natural resources.  A regenerative tourism contribution has been suggested by the Hawaii tourism authority as a means to obtain the necessary resources. The legislature believes that a one per cent transient accommodations tax (TAT) increase is necessary to provide the visitor industry with resources to improve visitor experience to sustain the economic benefits to Hawaii.  This one per cent TAT increase could generate the necessary funding each year to offset the adverse impacts of visitors and conserve Hawaii's irreplaceable green infrastructure in perpetuity. The legislature further finds that a malama aina visitor impact tax is a type of "green tax" or "environmental protection tax", which have been successfully implemented in many visitor destinations throughout the world, including the European Union, Galapagos Islands, Japan, New Zealand, and Palau.  In these locations, the taxes have demonstrated compounding benefits for visitors, residents, and natural landscapes and seascapes. The legislature believes that establishing a malama aina visitor impact tax as a one per cent increase in the TAT in Hawaii would be a significant and effective way to raise additional revenue to offset visitor impacts and ensure a healthy environment for future generations. A malama aina visitor impact tax provides a reasonable and appropriate way to generate these needed revenues. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Establish a malama aina visitor impact tax program, to be administered by the department of business, economic development, and tourism; (2)  Establish a malama aina visitor impact tax special fund to fund the malama aina visitor impact tax program; and (3)  Temporarily increase the transient accommodations tax by one per cent and deposit the additional tax revenue into the malama aina visitor impact tax special fund. SECTION 2.
