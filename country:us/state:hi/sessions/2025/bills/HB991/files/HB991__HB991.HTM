HB991 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 991 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO CRIMINAL HISTORY RECORD CHECKS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the Internal Revenue Service requires fingerprint-based background checks on current and prospective employees and contractors who receive access to federal tax information. Authorization to access fingerprint-based background checks is provided through state statute approved by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Act 35, Session Laws of Hawaii 2021, amended sections 28-17 and 846-2.7(b)(49), Hawaii Revised Statutes, to authorize the department of the attorney general to conduct fingerprint-based background checks through the Federal Bureau of Investigation on current or prospective employees or employees or agents of contractors.  Upon review of section 846-2.7(b)(49), Hawaii Revised Statutes, the Federal Bureau of Investigation determined that the statute failed the requirement of identifying the specific category of persons falling within the statute's purview, as the term "agents of contractors" was overly broad and not defined in the statute. The purpose of this Act is to delete the term "agents of contractors" in sections 28-17 and 846-2.7(b)(49), Hawaii Revised Statutes, to comply with the requirement of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for fingerprint-based background checks. SECTION 2. Section 28-17, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows: "(b)  The department of the attorney general may terminate or deny employment to any current or prospective employee, or terminate or refuse to secure the services of any contractor, if the department of the attorney general finds by reason of the background investigation conducted under subsection (a) that the current or prospective employee, contractor, or contractor's employee [or agent of the contractor] poses a risk to the security of federal tax information.  Termination or denial of employment, or termination or refusal to secure the services of any contractor, under this subsection, shall only occur after appropriate notification to the current or prospective employee, contractor, or contractor's employee [or agent of the contractor] of the findings of the background investigation, and after the current or prospective employee, contractor, or contractor's employee [or agent of the contractor] is given an opportunity to meet and rebut the findings.  Nothing in this subsection shall abrogate any applicable appeal rights under chapters 76 and 89 or administrative rules of the department of the attorney general."
