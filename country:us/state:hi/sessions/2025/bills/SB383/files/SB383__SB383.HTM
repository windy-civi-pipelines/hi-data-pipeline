SECTION 3.  The state procurement office shall submit a report of its findings and recommendations on the efficacy of the amendment to section 103D-305, Hawaii Revised Statutes, made by section 2 of this Act, and any proposed legislation, to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 2026. SECTION 4. This Act does not affect rights and duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, and proceedings that were begun before its effective date. SECTION 5.
