Section 1:
SB349 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 349 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO CAPITAL GAINS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii has a capital gains tax rate of 7.25 per cent, which is lower than the tax rate many of the State's residents pay on their wages and salaries.  The legislature further finds that the low capital gains tax rate primarily benefits wealthy individuals, including nonresidents who invest in real estate in the State.  According to the department of taxation, taxing capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income could generate over $132,000,000 in its first year of implementation, with that amount rising to an estimated $187,000,000 within six years. The legislature additionally finds that revenue generated by taxing capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income could be used to strengthen basic government programs, including tax credits for working families, emergency preparedness, disaster prevention, public education, affordable housing, construction, mental health services, public preschool programming, childcare access, climate change adaptation and mitigation, and homeless services. The legislature further finds that because section 55(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, which covers the maximum rate of tax on net capital gain of noncorporate taxpayers, is inoperative for the State, a simple repeal of the applicable provisions of the State's tax laws will impose the ordinary income tax rate to capital gains income. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to strengthen tax fairness for working families by taxing capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income. SECTION 2.  Section 235-51, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§235-51  Tax imposed on individuals; rates.  (a) There is hereby imposed on the taxable income of every: (1)  Taxpayer who files a joint return under section 235-93; and (2)  Surviving spouse, a tax determined in accordance with the following table: In the case of any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017: If the taxable income is:     The tax shall be: Not over $4,800              1.40% of taxable income Over $4,800 but              $67.00 plus 3.20% of not over $9,600              excess over $4,800 Over $9,600 but              $221.00 plus 5.50% of not over $19,200             excess over $9,600 Over $19,200 but             $749.00 plus 6.40% of not over $28,800             excess over $19,200 Over $28,800 but             $1,363.00 plus 6.80% of not over $38,400             excess over $28,800 Over $38,400 but             $2,016.00 plus 7.20% of not over $48,000             excess over $38,400 Over $48,000 but             $2,707.00 plus 7.60% of not over $72,000             excess over $48,000 Over $72,000 but             $4,531.00 plus 7.90% of not over $96,000             excess over $72,000 Over $96,000 but             $6,427.00 plus 8.25% of not over $300,000             excess over $96,000 Over $300,000 but             $23,257.00 plus 9.00% of not over $350,000             excess over $300,000 Over $350,000 but             $27,757.00 plus 10.00% of not over $400,000             excess over $350,000 Over $400,000                $32,757.00 plus 11.00% of excess over $400,000.

Raw Text:
SB349 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 349 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO CAPITAL GAINS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii has a capital gains tax rate of 7.25 per cent, which is lower than the tax rate many of the State's residents pay on their wages and salaries.  The legislature further finds that the low capital gains tax rate primarily benefits wealthy individuals, including nonresidents who invest in real estate in the State.  According to the department of taxation, taxing capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income could generate over $132,000,000 in its first year of implementation, with that amount rising to an estimated $187,000,000 within six years. The legislature additionally finds that revenue generated by taxing capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income could be used to strengthen basic government programs, including tax credits for working families, emergency preparedness, disaster prevention, public education, affordable housing, construction, mental health services, public preschool programming, childcare access, climate change adaptation and mitigation, and homeless services. The legislature further finds that because section 55(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, which covers the maximum rate of tax on net capital gain of noncorporate taxpayers, is inoperative for the State, a simple repeal of the applicable provisions of the State's tax laws will impose the ordinary income tax rate to capital gains income. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to strengthen tax fairness for working families by taxing capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income. SECTION 2.  Section 235-51, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§235-51  Tax imposed on individuals; rates.  (a) There is hereby imposed on the taxable income of every: (1)  Taxpayer who files a joint return under section 235-93; and (2)  Surviving spouse, a tax determined in accordance with the following table: In the case of any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017: If the taxable income is:     The tax shall be: Not over $4,800              1.40% of taxable income Over $4,800 but              $67.00 plus 3.20% of not over $9,600              excess over $4,800 Over $9,600 but              $221.00 plus 5.50% of not over $19,200             excess over $9,600 Over $19,200 but             $749.00 plus 6.40% of not over $28,800             excess over $19,200 Over $28,800 but             $1,363.00 plus 6.80% of not over $38,400             excess over $28,800 Over $38,400 but             $2,016.00 plus 7.20% of not over $48,000             excess over $38,400 Over $48,000 but             $2,707.00 plus 7.60% of not over $72,000             excess over $48,000 Over $72,000 but             $4,531.00 plus 7.90% of not over $96,000             excess over $72,000 Over $96,000 but             $6,427.00 plus 8.25% of not over $300,000             excess over $96,000 Over $300,000 but             $23,257.00 plus 9.00% of not over $350,000             excess over $300,000 Over $350,000 but             $27,757.00 plus 10.00% of not over $400,000             excess over $350,000 Over $400,000                $32,757.00 plus 11.00% of excess over $400,000.
