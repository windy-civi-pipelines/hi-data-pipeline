BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the statewide parking program for persons with disabilities provides individuals with mobility disabilities the ability to travel and park in accessible parking spaces.  However, individuals with a removeable windshield placard that travel to another island or outside the State are often in situations where they need to park in an accessible parking space at a Hawaii airport or port but also take their windshield placard to be used during their travels.
