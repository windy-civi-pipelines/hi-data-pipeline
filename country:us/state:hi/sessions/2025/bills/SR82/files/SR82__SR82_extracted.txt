SR82 THE SENATE S.R. NO. 82 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII SENATE RESOLUTION urging the Director of Health and the Director of Corrections and Rehabilitation to encourage hospitals and prisons to offer more healthy food options that consist of minimally‑processed fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, herbs and spices, and non-dairy beverages, rather than ultra-processed foods. WHEREAS, a diet that includes minimally-processed fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, herbs, and spices has been shown to reduce the chance of developing diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and various forms of cancer, among other chronic diseases; and WHEREAS, the American Heart Association encourages this diet because it reduces the risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and several other cardiovascular conditions; and WHEREAS, many people, including a large majority of Asian‑Americans, are lactose-intolerant and should have an option to avoid dairy products; and WHEREAS, offering minimally-processed fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, herbs and spices, and non-dairy beverages that meet the United States Department of Agriculture's nutritional standards for dairy milk substitutes rather than ultra-processed foods, such as those with artificial colors, flavors, preservatives, and other manufactured ingredients added, can promote a healthy lifestyle for inpatients in hospitals and prisoners, reducing health care costs; and WHEREAS, state-licensed hospitals, state-operated prisons, and government-sponsored events that offer healthier food options, rather than ultra-processed foods, can provide many additional benefits to the State, including: (1)  Saving taxpayers money; (2)  Advancing public health, including reducing dietary risk factors for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer; (3)  Supporting farmers throughout the State by increasing the demand for, and consumption of, local fruits and vegetables; and (4)  Promoting traditional Native Hawaiian environmental, dietary, and cultural practices; and WHEREAS, in July 2021, Hawaii became the first state to declare a climate emergency; and WHEREAS, studies indicate that ultra-processed foods account for up to one-third of total diet-related greenhouse gas emissions; and WHEREAS, offering healthy diet options at state-licensed hospitals, state-operated prisons, and government-sponsored events, rather than ultra-processed foods, can help the State reduce carbon emissions and respond to the climate emergency; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, that the Director of Health and the Director of Corrections and Rehabilitation are urged to encourage hospitals and prisons to offer more healthy food options that consist of minimally-processed fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, herbs and spices, and non-dairy beverages, rather than ultra-processed foods; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Director of Corrections and Rehabilitation and Director of Health.
