STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS TO SENATE BILL NO. 31
Honorable Members
Thirty-Third Legislature
State of Hawaii
Pursuant to Section 16 of Article III of the Constitution of the State of
Hawaii, I am returning herewith, without my approval. Senate Bill No. 31, entitled "A Bill
for an Act Relating to Property."
The purpose of this bill is to allow any person who discovers a recorded
discriminatory restrictive covenant to take certain actions, without liability, to record a
statement or notice that the discriminatory restrictive covenant is void and
unenforceable.
This bill is objectionable because it enables any person, including a
person who may have no interest in the real property in question, to record a statement
or notice that the chain of title for the real property contains a discriminatory restrictive
covenant that is void and unenforceable. Such a recorded statement or notice could
contain false or misleading information, and recordation could affect the marketability of
the subject property and cloud title without the recording party facing any liability.
Unfortunately, the bill does not provide a mechanism to prevent the recording of
frivolous or false statements or notices, nor does it provide a remedy for property
owners who might be affected by the recording of frivolous or false statements or
notices.
For the foregoing reasons, I am returning Senate Bill No. 31 without my
approval.
Respectfully,
JOSH GREEN, M.D.
Governor of Hawaii
