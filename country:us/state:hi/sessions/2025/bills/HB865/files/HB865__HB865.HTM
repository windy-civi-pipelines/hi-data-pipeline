Section 1:
HB865 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 865 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO EDUCATION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that financial education is a lifelong learning process that empowers individuals to plan for their futures. Historically, the education system has assumed that students learn important financial skills from their families. However, not all students are being taught the financial skills they will need to be successful later in life. The legislature also finds that a lack of financial literacy poses a significant barrier for individuals seeking to achieve financial prosperity and stability.  Personal financial education is essential to ensure that Hawaii's youth are prepared to manage money, credit, and debt, and to become responsible workers, heads of households, investors, entrepreneurs, business leaders, and educated citizens. The legislature further finds that it is of the utmost importance to educate Hawaii's youth in economic and financial matters to prepare them for financial independence through the development of fiscal responsibility and financial management skills. Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to require the department of education to include the teaching of financial literacy for grades kindergarten through twelve. SECTION 2. Chapter 302A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part II, subpart B, to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§302A-    Financial literacy; curricula plan; public schools.  (a)  The department shall develop and implement a statewide financial literacy curricula plan for public school students in kindergarten through grade twelve.
