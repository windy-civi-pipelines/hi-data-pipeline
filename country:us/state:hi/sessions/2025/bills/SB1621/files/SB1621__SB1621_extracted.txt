Section 1:
SB1621 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1621 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to nail technicians. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that requiring nail technicians to obtain a cosmetology license requires nail technicians to learn skills irrelevant to their profession.  Establishing a specific nail technician license and corresponding licensing requirements separate from a general cosmetology license will alleviate this burden on nail technicians. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to direct the department of commerce and consumer affairs to adopt rules establishing: (1)  A separate license for nail technicians; and (2)  Corresponding licensing requirements for nail technicians. SECTION 2.  Section 439A-6, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (g) to read as follows: "(g)  A nail technician applicant shall have an education equivalent to the completion of high school and [either: (1)  Seven hundred hours of training as a beauty apprentice in a beauty shop or barber shop under the supervision of a cosmetologist, esthetician, or nail technician; or (2)  Three hundred fifty hours of training in a beauty school.] meet requirements pursuant to the rules adopted by the department." SECTION 3. The department of commerce and consumer affairs shall adopt rules to establish: (1)  A nail technician license that shall be separate from a general cosmetologist license; and (2)  Corresponding licensing requirements specific only to the practice of nail technicians. SECTION 4. Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 5. This Act shall take effect upon its approval. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: DCCA; Rules; Nail Technicians; License Description: Requires the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs to adopt rules establishing a license and corresponding licensing requirements specifically for nail technicians separate from a general cosmetologist license.
