THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1
STATE OF HAWAII • - ■
A BILL FORAN ACT
RELATING TO FIREARMS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAH:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the presence of
2 unsecured or improperly stored firearms contributes to a
3 heightened risk of accidental injury, accidental death, suicide
4 by firearm, theft or loss of firearms, and increased lethality
5 in domestic violence situations. The legislature also finds
6 that regulations providing for the safe and secure storage of
7 firearms can reduce these risks. Additionally, the legislature
8 finds that there is a longstanding and well-established
9 historical tradition of regulating firearm storage to protect
10 public safety. In United States v. Rahimi, 144 S.Ct. 1889, 1897
11 (2024), the United States Supreme Court recognized that "[a]t
12 the founding, the bearing of arms was subject to regulations"
13 covering a range of subjects, including "rules about firearm
14 storage".
15 The purpose of this Act is to protect public safety by
16 providing for the safe and secure storage of firearms.
