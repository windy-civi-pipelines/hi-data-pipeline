Section 1:
SB1195 SD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1195 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO TRANSPORTATION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that roadway safety is the top transportation priority.  Pedestrians, bicyclists, and other vulnerable roadway users are disproportionately impacted by traffic fatalities and injuries, which are on the rise.  Between the 2009 to 2013 and the 2014 to 2018 five-year time periods, pedestrian fatalities across the State rose by twenty‑six per cent.  Decades of automobile‑centric planning and development have created formidable mobility barriers, including the lack of safe and accessible bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure.  Under Navahine v. Hawaiʻi Department of Transportation, CIVIL NO. ICCV-22-0000631 (Hawaii Cir.Ct.), the State has committed to completing its multimodal, bike and pedestrian network within the next five years. The legislature further finds that a disproportionately high number of pedestrian injuries and deaths occur at crosswalks and intersections.  One solution proven to help reduce these tragedies, is to allow both pedestrians and motorists greater visibility as they enter into, and drive through crosswalks. Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Prohibit street parking within twenty feet on each side of any crosswalk or intersection; and (2)  Specify that signs or curb markings shall not be required to restrict parking within twenty feet of a crosswalk or intersection; and (3)  Authorizing prohibited parking enforcement regardless of the existence of signage or curb markings. SECTION 2. Chapter 291C, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§291C-    Street parking restrictions.  (a) No vehicle parking abutting the curb or edge of a vehicle travel way shall be allowed within twenty feet of a crosswalk or intersection; provided that any vehicle may be parked within the designated buffer zone as applicable if the vehicle is: (1)  An authorized emergency vehicle performing the functions under section 291C-26; (2)  An official federal, state, or county vehicle in the performance of its duty; (3)  A stalled or broken vehicle; (4)  A vehicle necessary to assist a stalled or broken vehicle; (5)  A vehicle necessary to yield to an authorized emergency vehicle pursuant to section 291C-65; or (6)  Otherwise authorized by law. (b) The prohibition on parking within twenty feet of a crosswalk or intersection pursuant to subsection (a) may be enforced regardless of the presence or absence of official signs or curb markings." SECTION 3.  Section 291C-111, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows: "(b)  The director of transportation, the counties, and owners of private highways, with the consent of the county official responsible for traffic control with respect to highways under their respective jurisdictions shall place signs or curb markings that are clearly visible to an ordinarily observant person prohibiting or restricting the stopping, standing, or parking of vehicles on the highway[. Such]; provided that any sign or curb marking shall not be required to restrict parking within twenty feet of a crosswalk or intersection in accordance with section 291C-  . The signs or curb markings shall be official signs and markings and no person shall stop, stand, or park any vehicle in violation of the restrictions stated on [such] the signs or markings." SECTION 4. This Act does not affect rights and duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, and proceedings that were begun before its effective date. SECTION 5. Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 6. This Act shall take effect upon its approval. Report Title: DOT; Street Parking; Restrictions; Pedestrian Safety; Exemptions Description: Establishes buffer zones that ban street parking within certain distances of crosswalks under certain posted speed limits.  Authorizes the enforcement of prohibited parking regardless of signage or curb markings.  Specifies that signs or curb marking shall not be required to restrict parking within twenty feet of a crosswalk or intersection.  Designates exemptions.  (SD1) The summary description of legislation appearing on this page is for informational purposes only and is not legislation or evidence of legislative intent.
