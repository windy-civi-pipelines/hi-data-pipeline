Section 1:
SB1195 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1195 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to transportation. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that roadway safety is the top transportation priority.  Pedestrians, bicyclists, and other vulnerable roadway users are disproportionately impacted by traffic fatalities and injuries, which are on the rise.  Between the 2009 to 2013 and the 2014 to 2018 five-year time periods, pedestrian fatalities across the State rose by twenty‑six per cent.  Decades of automobile‑centric planning and development have created formidable mobility barriers, including the lack of safe and accessible bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure.  Under Navahine v. Hawaiʻi Department of Transportation, CIVIL NO. ICCV-22-0000631 (Hawaii Cir.Ct.), the State has committed to completing its multimodal, bike and pedestrian network within the next five years. The legislature further finds that a disproportionately high number of pedestrian injuries and deaths occur at crosswalks and intersections.  One solution proven to help reduce these tragedies, is to allow both pedestrians and motorists greater visibility as they enter into, and drive through crosswalks. Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Prohibit street parking within twenty feet on each side of any crosswalk with a speed limit of less than thirty-five miles per hour; and (2)  Prohibit street parking within forty feet on each side of any crosswalk when the crosswalk is on a road with a speed limit of more than thirty-five miles per hour. SECTION 2. Chapter 291C, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§291C-    Street parking restrictions.  No vehicle parking shall be allowed within: (1)  Twenty feet of a crosswalk or intersection on a road with a speed limit of less than thirty-five miles per hour; or (2)  Forty feet of a crosswalk or intersection on a road with a speed limit of thirty-five miles per hour or greater; provided that any vehicle may be parked within the designated buffer zone as applicable if the vehicle is: (1)  An authorized emergency vehicle performing the functions under section 291C-26; (2)  An official federal, state, or county vehicle in the performance of its duty; (3)  A stalled or broken vehicle; (4)  A vehicle necessary to assist a stalled or broken vehicle; (5)  A vehicle necessary to yield to an authorized emergency vehicle pursuant to section 291C-65; or (6)  Otherwise authorized by law." SECTION 3. This Act does not affect rights and duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, and proceedings that were begun before its effective date. SECTION 4. New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 5. This Act shall take effect upon its approval. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: Street Parking; Restrictions; Pedestrian Safety; Exemptions Description: Establishes buffer zones that ban street parking within certain distances of crosswalks under certain posted speed limits.  Designates exemptions.
