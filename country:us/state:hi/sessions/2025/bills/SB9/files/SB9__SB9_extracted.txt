Section 1:
SB9 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 9 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT Relating to plant-based building materials. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii's climate, with a year-round growing season and ample rain in many areas, has several potential advantages for growing the materials that can be processed into structural plant-based building materials.  For example, with sufficient water, there are types of clumping bamboo that can grow very rapidly and can be processed into building materials that are stronger, more flexible, and lighter than timber or steel and can be made more fire- and termite-resistant than wood.  "Hempcrete" developed from industrial hemp can substitute for building blocks.  "Biocements" produced from cyanobacteria, a blue-green algae also known as "pond scum," can substitute for Portland cement.  The legislature further finds that these plant-based building materials, and others, could bring green agriculture jobs to Hawaii. The legislature further finds that these plant-based building materials could also help Hawaii meet its net negative carbon and greenhouse gas goals because they sequester carbon, whereas production of traditional building materials such as timber, steel, and cement emit very large amounts of greenhouse gases. The legislature finds that the development of plant-based building materials in the State is a matter of statewide concern. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish, and appropriate funds for, a working group to report on how best to grow the appropriate plants; develop plant-based building materials; and create green jobs in Hawaii, while sequestering carbon and other greenhouse gases to help reach the State's climate target. SECTION 2. (a)  There is established a plant-based building materials working group to study how best to grow the appropriate plants for the development of plant-based building materials in Hawaii and provide green agricultural jobs while sequestering carbon and other greenhouse gases to help achieve the State's climate target. (b) The working group shall consist of the following: (1)  The dean and director of the university of Hawaii at Manoa college of tropical agriculture and human resources or their designee, who shall serve as chairperson; (2)  Four individuals who have expertise in growing or producing plant-based building materials, to be invited by the chairperson; (3)  The director of the university of Hawaii at Hilo college of agriculture, forestry, and natural resource management, or their designee; (4)  The chairperson of the board of agriculture, or their designee; (5)  The coordinator of the Hawaii climate change mitigation and adaptation commission; (6)  An expert in building materials, who the chairperson shall invite in consultation with the General Contractors Association of Hawaii; and (7)  Additional members with appropriate specialized expertise, as recommended by the members of the working group, to be invited at the discretion of the chairperson. (c) Members of the working group shall serve without compensation, but shall be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred, including travel expenses.  No member of the working group shall be made subject to chapter 84, Hawaii Revised Statutes, solely because of that member's participation as a member of the working group. (d) The working group shall submit a report of its findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 2027. (e) The working group shall be dissolved on June 30, 2027. SECTION 3. There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the plant-based building materials working group to study the development of a plant-based building materials industry in the State. The sums appropriated shall be expended by the university of Hawaii for the purposes of this Act. SECTION 4. This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2025. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: UH; Plant-Based Building Materials Working Group; Report; Appropriations Description: Appropriates funds to the University of Hawaii for the establishment and administration of the Plant-Based Building Materials Working Group to study how best to develop the plant-based building materials industry in the State.  Requires a report to the Legislature.
