Section 1:
HB884 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 884 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to agricultural lands. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that, under the Hawaii State Planning Act, two major objectives and policies for Hawaii agriculture are the growth and development of diversified agriculture and ensuring that the agricultural sector continues to constitute a dynamic and essential component of Hawaii's strategic, economic, and social well-being.  To achieve this objective, the State must conserve, protect, and encourage the development and improvement of available agricultural lands and facilities to produce food and other agricultural products. The legislature further finds that data released by the United States Department of Agriculture in December 2024 indicates that the amount of the State's farmland owned by foreign entities has dramatically increased in recent years.  Specifically, foreign ownership of Hawaii agricultural land increased from 166,000 acres to 278,000 acres during the last five years, constituting a sixty-five per cent increase. The legislature is concerned that the increasing percentage of agricultural land owned by foreign entities may adversely impact the State's ability to achieve its agricultural goals.  Because foreign landowners are likely domiciled thousands of miles away from Hawaii, they may not be able to give this agricultural land the attention needed to maximize its productivity.  Foreign entities may also have different stakeholders whose interests they need to assuage; the interests of those stakeholders may not align with the interests of local stakeholders in Hawaii.  Finally, foreign ownership raises national and economic security concerns. The legislature finds that many states have laws that prohibit or restrict the ability of foreign persons, businesses, and governments from acquiring or owning an interest in agricultural land. However, Hawaii currently does not have a similar restriction. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to promote the conservation, protection, and sustainable development of the State's agricultural resources by prohibiting certain foreign parties from owning, purchasing, or acquiring ownership of or an interest in agricultural lands. SECTION 2.  The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to title 11 to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Chapter PROHIBITION OF THE ACQUISITION OF AGRICULTURAL LANDS BY CERTAIN FOREIGN PARTIES §   -1  Definitions.  As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires: "Agricultural lands" means any real property within the agricultural district pursuant to section 205-2(d). "Interest in agricultural land" means all direct interest acquired, transferred, or held in agricultural land, including, without limitation, a lease of agricultural land: (1)  For a term of one year or longer; or (2)  That is renewable by option for terms that, if exercised, would be for a term of one year or longer. "Prohibited foreign party" means: (1)  The government or any official of the government of a foreign country; (2)  A partnership, association, corporation, organization, or other combination of persons organized under the laws of or having its principal place of business in a foreign country, or a subsidiary of that entity; (3)  Any person who is domiciled in a foreign country and is not a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States; (4)  Any person other than an individual or government: (A)  That is created or organized under the laws of any state; and (B)  In which a significant interest or substantial control is directly or indirectly held or is capable of being exercised by: (i)  A person or government described in paragraphs (1) through (3); or (ii)  Any combination of the persons or governments described in paragraphs (1) through (3); or (5)  Any agent, trustee, or other fiduciary of a person or government described in paragraphs (1) through (4).

(b)  If a prohibited foreign party who previously held agricultural land pursuant to subsection (a) loses resident alien status, the prohibited foreign party shall sell, transfer, or otherwise divest their interest in agricultural land within two years of the date on which the prohibited foreign party ceased to have resident alien status. (c)  If a prohibited foreign party who is required to sell, transfer, or divest an interest in agricultural land under subsection (b) fails to do so, the attorney general shall initiate a civil action in the circuit court in the county in which the agricultural land is located for the forfeiture of the interest in agricultural land.
