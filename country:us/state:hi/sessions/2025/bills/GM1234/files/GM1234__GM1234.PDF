A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION PROCUREMENT.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION I. The legislature finds that as the largest
2 department in the State with two hundred ninety-five schools and
3 forty-two thousand salaried and part-time employees, the
4 department of education must procure voluminous amounts of goods
5 and services to run its operation. However, the department's
6 small purchase procurement capacity is limited to under $25,000
7 per twelve-month period, positioning the department as the only
8 state department to not receive an increase threshold of
9 $100,000 for small purchase procurement.
10 The legislature further finds that the department of
11 education is mandated to provide at least thirty per cent
12 locally sourced foods to Hawaii's public schools by 2030.
13 Increasing the department's small purchase procurement capacity
14 for local edible produce and packaged food products will assist
15 the department in fulfilling its mandate to provide locally
16 sourced foods for the State's public schools.

C.D. 1
1 The purpose of this Act is to temporarily adjust the
2 department of education's small purchase procurement capacity by
3 exempting purchases of local edible produce and packaged food
4 products of less than $250,000 from the electronic procurement
5 system requirement and instead requiring no less than three
6 written quotes for those purchases.
7 SECTION 2. Chapter 302A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
8 amended by adding a new section to part V to be appropriately
9 designated and to read as follows:
10 "§3O2A- Local edible produce and packaged food products
11 procurement; small purchases. Notwithstanding section
12 103D-305 (c) and any other law to the contrary, procurements of
13 less than $250,000 for local edible produce and packaged food
14 products for the department shall be exempt from the requirement
15 to conduct procurements through an electronic system and shall
16 instead be subject to no less than three written quotes;
17 provided that if the department is unable to receive the
18 required number of written notifications as required by this
19 section, written justification shall be provided and kept by the
20 department."
21 SECTION 3. New statutory material is underscored.
