Section 1:
SB942 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 942 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT Relating to Rental Applications. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that landlords often require prospective tenants to provide recent paystubs to prove sufficient income to pay rent.  However, many individuals, including retirees, the self-employed, and those with alternative forms of income, may not have traditional paystubs but nevertheless possess sufficient financial resources to meet rental obligations.  By allowing tenants to demonstrate financial stability through unearned income or liquid assets, a fairer and more inclusive housing market can be created. The legislature further finds that retirees often rely on pensions, social security, investments, or savings to cover their living expenses.  These income streams are typically stable and reliable, even though they are not tied to traditional employment.  Denying retirees the opportunity to rent solely because they lack paystubs disregards their financial viability and unnecessarily limits their housing options.  This Act would ensure that retirees, who have contributed to society and saved responsibly, are not unfairly excluded from the rental market. The legislature also finds that prohibiting the requirement to produce paystubs would not only benefit retirees but also others who depend on non-traditional income, such as individuals with significant savings, trust funds, or investment portfolios. These individuals are equally capable of meeting rental obligations but often face barriers when landlords prioritize employment-based income verification.  Permitting prospective tenants to submit evidence of unearned income or liquid assets aligns with the broader goal of promoting housing accessibility while still allowing landlords to assess a tenant's ability to pay rent. The legislature further finds that this Act addresses equity concerns in the rental market, particularly in Hawaii, where housing affordability and availability are pressing issues.  This Act would prevent discrimination against individuals whose financial stability does not fit into outdated norms and create a more inclusive housing ecosystem. By recognizing the legitimacy of alternative income sources, access to housing can be ensured for all financially capable individuals, regardless of their employment status. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to modernize the rental application process and recognize the diversity of income sources in today's society by prohibiting landlords from rejecting prospective tenants solely because they cannot provide paystubs as proof of income; provided that the prospective tenant can provide evidence of liquid assets or unearned income sufficient to cover rental costs. SECTION 2. Chapter 521, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§521-    Rental applications; proof of income; paychecks; prohibition.  In considering an application to rent a dwelling unit, no landlord shall reject an applicant solely due to the applicant's inability to submit evidence of a recent paycheck; provided that the landlord may require the applicant to submit to the landlord evidence of unearned income or liquid assets sufficient to satisfy the rent for the term of the prospective rental period." SECTION 3. This Act does not affect rights and duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, and proceedings that were begun before its effective date. SECTION 4. New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 5. This Act shall take effect upon its approval. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: Landlord; Rent; Application; Proof of Income; Paychecks Description: Prohibits a landlord from rejecting a rental application solely due to an applicant's inability to provide a recent paycheck; provided that the applicant can provide evidence of sufficient liquid assets or unearned income to cover the rental costs.
