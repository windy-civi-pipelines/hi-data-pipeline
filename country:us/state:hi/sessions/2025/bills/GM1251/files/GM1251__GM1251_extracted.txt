STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO HEALTH.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAH:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that prior authorization
2 is a health plan cost-control process that requires physicians,
3 health care professionals, and hospitals to obtain advance
4 approval from a health plan before a specific service to a
5 patient is qualified for payment or coverage. Each health plan
6 has its own policies and procedures that health care providers
7 are required to navigate to have services they prescribe for
8 their patients approved for payment before being provided to the
9 patient. Each health plan uses its own standards and methods,
10 the individual judgment of an employed medical director, or
11 advice from a contracted firm for determining the medical
12 necessity of the services prescribed, which are not transparent
13 or clear to the prescribing clinician or health care provider.
14 The legislature further finds that there is emerging
15 consensus among health care providers that prior authorization
16 increases administrative burdens and costs. In the 2023
17 physician workforce report published by the university of Hawaii

1 John A. Burns school of medicine, physicians voted prior
2 authorization as their top concern regarding administrative
3 burden. Furthermore, a physician survey conducted by the
4 American Medical Association reported that ninety-five per cent
5 of physicians attribute prior authorization to somewhat or
6 significantly increased physician burnout, and that more than
7 one in three physicians have staff who work exclusively on prior
8 authorization. The survey also found that:
9 (1) Eighty-three per cent of prior authorization denials
10 were subsequently overturned by health plans;
11 (2) Ninety-four per cent of respondents said that the
12 prior authorization process always, often, or
13 sometimes delays care;
14 (3) Nineteen per cent of respondents said prior
15 authorization resulted in a serious adverse event
16 leading to a patient being hospitalized;
17 (4) Thirteen per cent of respondents said prior
18 authorization resulted in a serious adverse event
19 leading to a life-threatening event or requiring
20 intervention to prevent permanent impairment or
21 damage; and

1 (5) Seven per cent of respondents said prior authorization
2 resulted in a serious adverse event leading to a
3 patient’s disability, permanent body damage,
4 congenital anomaly, birth defect, or death.
5 The legislature believes that reducing the burdens of prior
6 authorization will assist health care providers, thereby
7 ensuring the health and safety of their patients.
8 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
9 (1) Examine prior authorization practices in the State by
10 requiring utilization review entities to report
11 certain prior authorization data to the state health
12 planning and development agency; and
13 (2) Establish the health care appropriateness and
14 necessity working group to make recommendations to
15 improve and expedite the prior authorization process.
16 SECTION 2. Chapter 323D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
17 amended by adding two new sections to part II to be
