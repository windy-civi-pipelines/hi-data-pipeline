C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO PROCUREMENT.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII;
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that it is necessary for
2 the State to investigate and employ new and innovative ways of
3 maintaining and improving state services and infrastructure,
4 while ensuring the prudent and cost-effective expenditure of
5 public moneys.
6 The legislature further finds that in 2022, the legislature
7 authorized a procurement automation system for the executive
8 branch and state agencies. This procurement automation system
9 increases efficiency, saves personnel time, maintains
10 consistency, mitigates confusion for both the buyer and
11 contractor, and produces accurate purchasing data to leverage
12 economies of scale. The legislature also authorized the state
13 procurement office to implement a transaction fee imposed upon
14 vendors using the procurement automation system beginning in
15 fiscal year 2024-2025. This fee is intended to pay for the
16 management of the procurement automation system, including but
17 not limited to implementation, legacy transition, maintenance,

1 system training, and system configuration. This fee is
2 estimated to save the state approximately $1,200,000 in general
3 funds each year and will assist with funding the growth and
4 enhancement of the procurement automation system.
5 While the legislature authorized the implementation of the
6 procurement automation system and a transaction fee collected
7 from vendors using the system, the legislature stopped short of
8 authorizing a state procurement automation system special fund
9 to hold the transaction fee. Until a special fund is authorized
10 and established, the fees are being held in trust by the vendor
11 who developed the procurement automation system; the state
12 procurement office does not have direct control of the fees.
13 The establishment of a special fund would direct that all fees
14 received by the state procurement office pursuant to section
15 1030-206(7), Hawaii Revised Statutes, be deposited into the
16 state procurement automation system special fund to be
17 administered by the state procurement office for the
18 implementation and configuration of the procurement automation
19 system's Marketplace and eProcurement system, as well as its
20 maintenance, enhancement, and expansion of additional modules to

1 remain relevant and current with industry standards for the
2 benefit of all stakeholders statewide.
3 The legislature also finds that the school facilities
4 authority was established in 2020 by Act 72, Session Laws of
5 Hawaii 2020, codified at section 302A-1702, Hawaii Revised
6 Statutes, with a mandate that the executive director of the
7 school facilities authority serve as its chief procurement
8 officer. Therefore, it is necessary to designate the executive
9 director of the school facilities authority as its chief
10 procurement officer in the Hawaii Public Procurement Code.
11 The purpose of this Act is to enhance procurement
12 accountability by:
13 (1) Establishing the state procurement automation system
14 special fund to receive the transaction fees from the
15 procurement automation system to pay for its
16 administration, management, operation, maintenance,
17 and upgrade of the procurement automation system; and
18 (2) Aligning section 103D-203(a), Hawaii Revised Statutes,
19 with section 302A-1702, Hawaii Revised Statutes, by
20 adding the executive director of the school facilities

1 authority as the chief procurement officer for the

3 SECTION 2. Chapter 103D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
4 amended by adding a new section to part II to be appropriately
5 designated and to read as follows:
6 ”§1030- State££ocurement aut«nation syatem s£eci^
7 fund; transaction fee. (a) There is established in the state
8 treasury the state procurement automation system special fund to

12 103D-206(7), for administration, management,
13 operation, maintenance, and upgrade of the procurement
14 automation system; and
15 (2) Appropriations made by the legislature to the special
16 fund.
17 (b) The state procurement automation special fund shall be
18 expended by the administrator of the state procurement office
19 for the purposes of the administration, management, operation,
20 maintenance, and upgrade of the procurement automation system.”
