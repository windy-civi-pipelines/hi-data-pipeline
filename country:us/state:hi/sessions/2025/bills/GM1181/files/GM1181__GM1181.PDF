THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO TRANSPORTATION,
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. This Act shall be known and may be cited as the
2 "Mila Microchip Identification Act".
3 SECTION 2. The legislature finds that since January 1,
4 2022, all cat and dog owners in Hawaii have been required to
5 have a microchip implanted in their pet and to register that
6 microchip number and the owner's contact information with a
7 microchip registration company. The legislature further finds
8 that when employees of the state and county agencies responsible
9 for disposing roadkill pick up dead cats and dogs that have been
10 killed on public roadways, they do not routinely scan the
11 deceased animals for microchips or take any other measures to
12 ascertain the animal's owner. As a result, owners of lost cats
13 or dogs are not informed if their pet has been killed by a
14 vehicle.
15 The legislature further finds that the tragic incident
16 involving a dog named Mila, as reported by KITV News on
17 November 8, 2024, highlights a critical gap in existing policies

1 and procedures. Due to the absence of proper scanning equipment
2 within the department of transportation and the lack of clear
3 rules for owner notification, Mila was disposed of without her
4 owner being informed. This measure seeks to address such
5 deficiencies by establishing clear directives for notification
6 and the use of scanning equipment to prevent similar occurrences
7 in the future.
8 Furthermore, the legislature recognizes that this measure
9 aligns with the intent expressed in the previous legislative
10 session through House Concurrent Resolution No. 171 and House
11 Resolution No. 150. By enacting this legislation, the
12 legislature affirms its commitment to animal welfare and
13 responsible procedures for handling lost or deceased pets.
14 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
15 (1) Require the department of transportation and each
16 county to:
17 (A) Scan any cat or dog carcass found on a state or
18 county roadway for a microchip;
19 (B) Record certain information and report that
20 information to the appropriate county animal
21 services or animal service contractors; and

1 (C) Make reasonable efforts to contact the registered
2 owner; and
3 (2) Authorize the department of transportation and each
4 county to coordinate with each other to share scanner
5 resources or protocols.
6 SECTION 3. Chapter 264, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
7 amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated
8 and to read as follows:
9 "§264- Microchip scanning of deceased, animals on
10 roadways. (a) The department of transportation shall:
11 (1) Scan any cat or dog carcass found on a state roadway
12 for a microchip;
13 (2) Record any microchip number or other identifying
14 information and a basic description of the animal, if
15 discernible;
16 (3) Notify the appropriate county animal services
17 contractor or animal control agency within forty-eight
18 hours of discovery; and
19 (4) When feasible, make reasonable efforts to contact the
20 registered owner of a deceased animal if microchip
21 information is obtained.
