C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
MAKING EMERGENCY APPROPRIATIONS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL
COSTS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAH:
1 SECTION 1. This Act is recommended by the governor for
2 immediate passage in accordance with section 9 of article VII of
3 the Constitution of the State of Hawaii.
4 SECTION 2. The legislature finds that section 3 of
5 Act 164, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023, as amended by Act 230,
6 Session Laws of Hawaii 2024, appropriated general funds to the
7 department of accounting and general services in fiscal year
8 2024-2025 for an interdepartmental transfer to the department of
9 law enforcement for payroll costs of sheriffs. Similarly,
10 section 3 of Act 70, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023, as amended by
11 Act 233, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024, appropriated general funds
12 in fiscal year 2024-2025 to the judiciary for an
13 interdepartmental transfer to the department of law enforcement
14 for payroll costs of sheriffs.
15 While appropriations for payroll costs out of the general
16 fund exclude fringe benefit costs, fringe benefits must be

1 included if an appropriation for an interdepartmental transfer
2 is used to fund positions. Because these aforementioned
3 appropriation amounts did not include fringe benefits, a
4 critical funding shortage exists, and additional funds must be
5 appropriated to cover fringe benefit costs for affected law
6 enforcement personnel of the department of law enforcement.
7 The purpose of this Act is to make emergency appropriations
8 to the department of accounting and general services and the
9 judiciary to provide funds to cover payroll and fringe benefits
10 of affected law enforcement personnel.
11 SECTION 3. There is appropriated out of the general
12 revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $2,480,509 or so much
13 thereof as may be necessary in fiscal year 2024-2025 for an
14 interdepartmental transfer from the department of accounting and
15 general services to the department of law enforcement for
16 personnel costs, including payroll and fringe benefits.
17 The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of
18 accounting and general services for the purposes of this Act.
19 SECTION 4. There is appropriated out of the general
20 revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $4,673,616 or so much
21 thereof as may be necessary in fiscal year 2024-2025 for an

1 interdepartmental transfer from the judiciary to the department
2 of law enforcement for personnel costs, including payroll and
3 fringe benefits.
4 The sum appropriated shall be expended by the judiciary for
5 the purposes of this Act.
6 SECTION 5. There is appropriated out of interdepartmental
7 transfer funds the sum of $7,154,125 or so much thereof as may
8 be necessary for fiscal year 2024-2025 for personnel costs,
9 including payroll and fringe benefits.
10 The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of
11 law enforcement.
12 SECTION 6. In accordance with section 9 of article VII of
13 the Constitution of the State of Hawaii and sections 37-91 and
14 37-93, Hawaii Revised Statutes, the legislature has determined
15 that at the beginning of the regular session of 2025, the
16 general fund expenditure ceiling for fiscal year 2024-2025 was
17 exceeded by $8,551,795, or one per cent. The appropriations
18 contained in Act 1, Session Laws of Hawaii 2025, caused the
19 general fund expenditure ceiling for fiscal year 2024-2025 to be
20 further exceeded by an additional $30,334,159. Therefore, the

C.D. 1
1 general fund expenditure ceiling for fiscal year 2024-2025 has
2 already been exceeded by $38,885,954, or one per cent.
3 The appropriations contained in this Act will cause the
4 general fund expenditure ceiling for fiscal year 2024-2025 to be
5 further exceeded by $7,154,125, or one per cent. This
6 declaration takes into account the additional general fund
7 appropriations authorized for fiscal year 2024-2025 in this Act
8 only. The reasons for exceeding the general fund expenditure
9 ceiling are that the appropriations made in this Act are
10 necessary to serve the public interest and to meet the needs
11 addressed by this Act.
12 SECTION 7. This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
