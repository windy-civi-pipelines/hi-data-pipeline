STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO ADMINISTRATIVE LICENSURE ACTIONS AGAINST SEX
OFFENDERS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that a recent Civil Beat
2 article highlighted the inability of state licensing boards and
3 agencies to promptly revoke the professional licenses of
4 registered sex offenders. The legislature believes that timely
5 action in cases where certain professional license holders are
6 registered sex offenders is a vital aspect of consumer
7 protection. Delayed action in revoking a license and preventing
8 further practice by a registered sex offender places consumers
9 at unnecessary risk.
10 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
11 (1) Authorize the department of commerce and consumer
12 affairs and certain licensing boards to automatically
13 revoke and deny the renewal, restoration, or
14 reinstatement of a license to a licensee who is a
15 registered sex offender;
16 (2) Establish conditions for the disciplinary action; and
