STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII RESIDENT TUITION FEE.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that facilitating
2 postsecondary education and training for all interested high
3 school graduates is a matter of statewide concern.
4 Postsecondary options assist graduates by preparing them for
5 jobs and career pathways that typically pay higher wages, which
6 enables them to achieve their educational and career goals and
7 afford the State's high cost of living. Increased enrollment
8 and completion of postsecondary education and training will
9 increase the State's human capital.
10 The legislature further finds that the university of Hawaii
11 amended its administrative rules to streamline the enrollment
12 process for all applicants for admission into the university of
13 Hawaii system; however, the current statutory requirements
14 regarding residency for tuition purposes pose challenges for
15 some local graduating high school seniors or recent graduates.
16 Specifically, some students experiencing homelessness have
17 difficulty providing evidence of bona fide residency as required

1 by statute, and students who have complex family situations may
2 be incorrectly considered nonresidents. The legislature further
3 finds that recognizing local high school graduates as residents
4 to qualify for resident tuition fees would facilitate the
5 enrollment of these students at one of the university of
6 Hawaii's campuses.
7 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to simplify the
8 residency determination for the State's high school graduates to
9 enroll in postsecondary education and training at the university
10 of Hawaii by considering graduates of the State's high schools
11 to be residents for tuition purposes.
12 SECTION 2. Section 304A-402, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
13 amended to read as follows:
14 "[+1§3O4A-4O2[^] Residence for tuition purposes; basic
15 rule. The board of regents shall adopt the necessary rules
16 defining residence for tuition purposes herein; provided that
17 the basic rule shall be that a student shall qualify for the

17 entitled to do so under a child support order or
18 agreement issued or entered into in conjunction
19 with a divorce proceeding or legal separation
