<div class=WordSection2>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, we the people of the United States of
America are each of us subject to the United States Constitution and to the
nation's laws; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, every person subject to the nation's laws
is expected to follow those laws, and is punished if he or she breaks those
laws; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, the President of the United States has an
especially sacred duty to uphold the nation's laws, as it is the President's
responsibility to &quot;take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed&quot;
under Article II of the United States Constitution; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, under the United States Constitution no
person, including the President of the United States, may disregard or disobey
laws which he or she considers unfair, unjust, or otherwise illegitimate; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, the founding fathers, aware of the risks
posed by a government headed by a single, all-powerful king, intentionally
created &quot;a government of laws, not of men,&quot; as John Adams described
it; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, the founders divided the power of
government to make, enforce, and interpret the laws among three coequal and
independent branches of government; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, the judicial branch of the United States
government is a check on the awesome power of the other two branches of
government, and which, unlike the legislative and executive branches, has no
power other than its power to exercise its judgment over issues of federal law;
and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, the structure of the judicial branch led
Alexander Hamilton to declare in the Federalist Papers that &quot;the judiciary
... will always be the least dangerous to the political rights of the
Constitution&quot;; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, despite the brilliant design of the United
States judiciary created by the founding fathers, the President of the United
States and his cabinet secretaries have repeatedly attacked the judiciary
simply for carrying out its duty to interpret the laws and United States
Constitution, as a check on the power of the executive branch of government;
and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, the President and his cabinet secretaries
have not only attacked the normal operation of the judiciary, but have also
repeatedly, openly, and shamelessly refused to comply with lawful court orders;
and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, despite a lawful court order entered by a
federal judge directing the President and his administration to stop freezing
federal funds lawfully allocated by Congress, several federal agencies have
continued to freeze funding; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, despite a lawful court order entered by a
federal judge directing the President and his administration to resume refugee
admissions, given that only Congress, and not the President, can eliminate a
program that was created by Congress, the President has failed to reimplement
the program; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, despite a lawful court order entered by a
federal judge directing the President and his administration to stop any
deportations under the alleged authority of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act,
including by turning around airborne planes carrying deportees if necessary,
the President and his administration allowed the deportations to go forward and
then openly bragged about defying the judge's order, and have to date failed to
offer any justification for these actions, despite additional court orders
requiring them to do so; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, some of these orders have been nationwide
injunctions, which apply to the government's challenged actions across the
country, and which have been employed by the nation's federal courts for at
least six decades, including extensively during the Obama, Biden, and previous
Trump administrations; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, nationwide injunctions are necessary in
certain circumstances, including where a lesser injunction would fail to
provide complete relief to the parties, to protect nonparties from irreparable
injury, or would otherwise be unworkable, as both the Fifth Circuit and Ninth
Circuit have recognized; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, legal community leaders across the United
States of America have called for all government officials to follow the law
and court orders; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, some members of Congress have insisted
that the President of the United States of America must comply with lawful
court orders; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, Republican leaders in the Senate,
including Senate Majority Leader John Thune (South Dakota), James Lankford (Oklahoma),
Mike Rounds (South Dakota), and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), as well as chair of
the Senate Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley (Iowa), <span style='color:black'>and</span>
members of the Senate Judiciary Committee Josh Hawley (Missouri) and John
Kennedy (Louisiana), also expect the President of the United States of America
to follow judicial orders; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, Republican Senator Josh Hawley (Missouri),
member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said </p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:58.5pt;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>&quot;I think
outright, ...[you cannot ignore the decision].  Andrew Jackson did that
infamously.  He was wrong on that.  That was the Trail of Tears.  <b><i>That
was lawless.  That was wrong</i></b>.&quot; (emphasis added); and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski (Alaska),<span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia",serif;color:black'> </span><span
style='color:black'>member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and other
Senate committees said:</span></p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:58.5pt;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>&quot;The White
House should comply with court rulings. The Congress should comply.  We have a
judicial system.  If you don't like the ruling, you can appeal the ruling and
you can follow that through.  But we are a nation of laws and it is not
necessarily for you or I to be the final arbiter here.  This is why we entrust
the judiciary with this responsibility.&quot;; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, members of the judicial branch have
similarly cautioned that the President must comply with lawful court orders,
including former federal Judge Paul Grimm, who stated that &quot;without those
checks and balances, we don't have the rule of law.  No right of any individual
in this country is safe&quot;; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, in response to attacks on the judiciary's
legitimate power, the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court was
recently forced to state that &quot;for more than two centuries, it has been
established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement
concerning a judicial decision.  The normal appellate review process exists for
that purpose&quot;; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, the proper response to an unfavorable
court decision is also appeal, not the refusal to comply with that order; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, it is the duty of the President of the
United States, like all good people in the United States, to follow the law as
set forth by the United States Congress and interpreted by the United States
courts, whether he or she likes or agrees with those laws or the decisions of
courts interpreting those laws; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, the President of the United States, as
well as any duly appointed representative of the President, has an obligation
to be truthful and forthcoming with a judge in a court of law, just as any
other American citizen would; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, under the United States's laws and
Constitution, any person who refuses to comply with lawful court orders, or who
otherwise willfully obstructs the court's efforts to pursue truth and justice,
is subject to penalties, punishments, and other consequences to the extent
permitted under the law; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     WHEREAS, if the President or any other government
officer is allowed to simply disregard federal law or a lawful court order, the
nation's elected leaders have abandoned the bedrock principles of the United
States Constitution that inspired the founding fathers to create this great
Nation in the first place; now, therefore,</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the Thirty-third
Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, the House of
Representatives concurring, that the President of the United States, and all
members of any current and future administration, are urged to abide by the
laws of the United States, including by complying with orders issued by the
United States courts; and</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=ResolutionBody>     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of
this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United
States, President Pro Tempore of the United States Senate, Speaker of the
United States House of Representatives, and Chief Justice of the United States
Supreme Court.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
