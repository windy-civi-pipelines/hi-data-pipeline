HB278 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 278 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to policing. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that public trust in law enforcement is critical to ensuring justice for all under the law.  The legislature further finds that data collection is one essential tool to allow the public, police, and policymakers to analyze the effectiveness of existing practices, determine which policies work and do not work, and support policy decisions with clear and relevant data. Numerous states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws to standardize the collection of complete and accurate policing data to increase community trust, transparency, and internal accountability through data analysis.  Similarly, in 2020, Hawaii enacted Act 47, Session Laws of Hawaii 2020, to standardize best practices for the use of force between the counties. The purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Require county police departments and police oversight agencies to collect and report certain data regarding police stops, arrests, uses of force, and complaints to the crime prevention and justice assistance division of the department of the attorney general; and (2)  Require the crime prevention and justice assistance division of the department of the attorney general to collect and publish incident-level information and an annual report on the data collected. SECTION 2.  Chapter 52D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part    .  Police data §52D- Definitions.  As used in this part: "Complaint" means any allegation of unlawful, unauthorized, or otherwise inappropriate conduct by a police officer against a member of the public. "Division" means the crime prevention and justice assistance division of the department of the attorney general. "Physical force" means the use of physical effort or the application of a tool, technique, or weapon intended to induce a person's compliance or overcome a person's resistance.  "Physical force" does not include physical contact used solely for facilitating custody of a fully compliant person, such as the application of handcuffs on a cooperative arrestee. "Police oversight agency" means any agency, board, or commission created by a political subdivision to accept and review complaints against police officers employed by the political subdivision. "Police stop" or "stop" means any encounter, whether on foot or in a vehicle, between a police officer and a member of the public whether initiated by the officer or conducted in response to a call for service, that: (1)  Constitutes a non-consensual stop or a stop that would make a reasonable person feel that they are not free to leave or otherwise end the encounter; or (2)  Culminates in a consensual or non-consensual frisk, search, seizure of property, or arrest of a person, including an arrest pursuant to an outstanding warrant. "Police stop" does not include a detention or search of a vehicle or pedestrian at a roadblock or checkpoint, which is conducted based on a neutral formula that does not include any personal characteristics or attributes.  "Police stop" includes a vehicle or pedestrian at a roadblock or checkpoint that is singled out for additional screening or inspection based on individualized suspicion or personal characteristics. "Publicly available" means posted conspicuously in a text-searchable format that is accessible at no cost.
