STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 2
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO INVASIVE SPECIES PREVENTION.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that diversifying and
2 strengthening the State's agricultural sector is a high
3 priority. Citrus, including oranges, limes, tangelos, and
4 grapefruit, is increasingly being planted in the State,
5 particularly on Maui. According to the United States Department
6 of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service,
7 the production of citrus crops in the State increased from
8 347,610 pounds in 2018 to 940,770 pounds in 2021. The
9 legislature wants to protect and promote citrus crops as
10 production continues to increase and as pest and disease
11 pressure in major citrus-producing states hamper production.
12 The legislature further finds that the federal and state
13 governments must work cooperatively to prevent the spread of
14 pests and diseases that impact crops, including citrus. When a
15 pest or disease of high concern is discovered infesting a crop
16 or is being moved with a particular commodity, the USDA may
17 establish a quarantine on that infested crop or commodity to

1 prevent the movement of invasive pests or diseases from an
2 infested area to a non-infested area.
3 The legislature also finds that citrus crops around the
4 world are threatened by serious diseases and pests, including
5 huanglongbing (citrus greening), citrus canker, citrus black
6 spot, and many species of fruit flies. Citrus greening is the
7 most serious citrus disease as there is no cure, the fruit of
8 infected trees never mature, and infected trees die within a few
9 years. The disease has devastated millions of acres of citrus
10 crops around the world. In the United States, it is currently
11 found in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana,
12 Mississippi, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Texas, and the United
13 States Virgin Islands. Hawaii is one of the very few
14 citrus-producing states that remains free of citrus greening.
15 The legislature additionally finds that the USDA
16 establishes and updates areas and items that are quarantined and
17 not allowed to be moved interstate to prevent the spread of
18 diseases and pests, including those affecting citrus.
19 The legislature further finds that the Hawaii department of
20 agriculture restricts the importation of many citrus species
21 from Puerto Rico and parts of south Florida to protect against

1 Caribbean fruit flies. However, these restrictions were last
2 updated in 1981 and are not sufficient to protect citrus crops
3 in the State today.
4 The legislature also finds that federal USDA inspectors do
5 not inspect items coming into Hawaii from other states, and when
6 commodities from quarantined areas arrive in the State, the
7 department of agriculture does not have the legal authority to
8 enforce federal quarantines. Therefore, while the USDA
9 quarantines are established to protect the State from
10 potentially devastating invasive pests and diseases, there is no
11 mechanism to enforce them in the State.
12 The legislature finds that authorizing inspectors of the
13 department of agriculture to enforce federal pest and disease
14 quarantines will close this gap in the State's biosecurity.
15 Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to authorize the
16 department of agriculture to enforce federal quarantines to
17 prevent the introduction of invasive pests and diseases into the
18 State.
19 SECTION 2. Chapter 150A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
20 amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated
21 and to read as follows:

1 "§150A- Federal and state quarantines; enforcement;
2 cooperative agreements. (a) The department may enter into
3 cooperative agreements with the United States Department of
4 Agriculture and other federal, state, or county agencies to
5 assist in the enforcement of federal quarantines. The
6 department may seize, destroy, or require treatment of articles
7 moved from a federally regulated area if the articles were not
8 moved in accordance with the federal quarantine rules or, if
9 certified, the articles were found to be infested with the pest.
10 (b) Interstate shipments for entry into this State shall
11 be subject to the following;
12 (1) A regulated or restricted article shall not enter this
13 State if it is prohibited from interstate movement
14 pursuant to a federal quarantine; or
15 (2) The owner or carrier of regulated or restricted
16 articles that are reportedly originating in
17 nonregulated areas of a quarantined state shall
18 provide proof of origin of the regulated or restricted
19 articles through a waybill, or other shipping
20 document, unless otherwise required in title 7 Code of
21 Federal Regulations part 301.
