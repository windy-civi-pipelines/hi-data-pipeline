NO. 84 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII SENATE RESOLUTION requesting the governor to convene a temporary working group to investigate THE EXISTENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL DANGERS OF PER- AND POLYFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES AND other RELATED CHEMICALS. WHEREAS, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of man-made chemicals widely used in consumer products, industrial processes, and firefighting foams, and are known to persist in the environment and accumulate in the human body over time; and WHEREAS, exposure to PFAS has been linked to significant health risks, including but not limited to cancer, liver damage, developmental issues, weakened immune systems, and endocrine disruption; and WHEREAS, PFAS contamination has been detected in water supplies, soil, and air across the United States, raising concerns about the presence of these toxic substances in Hawaii and their impact on the health of its residents and natural resources; and WHEREAS, Hawaii's ecosystems, including its waterways, bodies of water, fish, and other animals consumed by humans, are integral to the State's food security and cultural practices; and WHEREAS, the geographic isolation of the State and its reliance on a delicate and limited supply of fresh water heighten the need for a thorough understanding of PFAS contamination and its potential impacts on human health and the environment; and WHEREAS, testing in bodies of water and waterways, as well as testing fish and other animals for human consumption, is necessary to identify contamination, assess potential health risks, and ensure the safety of food and water sources in Hawaii; and WHEREAS, the creation of a temporary working group can provide a centralized and coordinated approach to assess PFAS‑related issues, engage with stakeholders, and propose actionable recommendations; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, that the Governor is requested to convene a temporary working group to investigate the existence and environmental dangers of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and other related chemicals; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the following individuals are requested to serve as members of the working group: (1)  A representative from the Department of Health; (2)  A representative from the Department of Land and Natural Resources; (3)  A representative from the Department of Agriculture; (4)  A representative from the University of Hawaii System; and (5)  Any other relevant stakeholders, including environmental organizations, industry representatives, and community groups, as determined by the members of the working group; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the working group is requested to: (1)  Identify locations in the State where PFAS contamination is present or suspected, including potential sources such as military installations, industrial sites, and landfills; (2)  Conduct testing in waterways and bodies of water to assess contamination levels; (3)  Test fish and other animals consumed by humans to determine the extent of bioaccumulation and potential health risks; (4)  Assess the environmental and public health risks associated with PFAS exposure, particularly in sensitive ecosystems and vulnerable communities; (5)  Review existing regulations and practices to identify gaps in PFAS management and mitigation; (6)  Propose strategies for testing, monitoring, remediation, and prevention of PFAS contamination; and (7)  Recommend changes to state policies, programs, and resources to address PFAS-related challenges effectively; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the working group is requested to submit interim reports to the Legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Sessions of 2026 and 2027, and submit a final report to the Legislature no later than twenty days prior to the Regular Session of 2028, and that these reports are requested to include findings, recommendations, proposed legislation, and potential funding sources; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Governor, Director of Health, Chairperson of the Board of Land and Natural Resources, Chairperson of the Board of Agriculture, and President of the University of Hawaii.
