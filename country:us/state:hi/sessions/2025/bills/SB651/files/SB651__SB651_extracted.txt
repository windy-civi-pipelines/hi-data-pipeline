(b) The director shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section, including rules that subject other tax expenditures authorized under this title to this section. (c) For the purpose of this section: "Tax expenditure" has the same meaning as defined in section 231-   .
