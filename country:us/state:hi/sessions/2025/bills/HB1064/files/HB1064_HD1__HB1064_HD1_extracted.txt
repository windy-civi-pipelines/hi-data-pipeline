Section 1:
HB1064 HD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1064 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO FIRE PROTECTION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that in the aftermath of the August 2023 Lahaina wildfires, the department of the attorney general initiated an investigation and retained the independent, third-party Fire Safety Research Institute, part of UL Research Institutes, to assess the performance of state and county agencies in preparing for and responding to the August 2023 Lahaina wildfires.  The investigation led to three reports -- a "Phase 1" comprehensive timeline report, a "Phase 2" incident analysis report, and a "Phase 3" forward-looking report. The "Phase 3" forward-looking report organized these findings and provided a prioritized list of action items of changes to be made to improve Hawaii's response to wildfires for the State and all counties.  The report calls for changes and improvements to the office of the state fire marshal, which was established by Act 209, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024  among them, bolstering statutory authority of the office of the state fire marshal to address the wide spectrum of fire safety issues, delineating responsibilities and reporting structures between the state fire marshal and the state fire council, and creating an organizational structure to immediately address the State's fire-safety priorities effectively. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to effectuate the recommendations of the "Phase 3" forward-looking report.

HB1064 HD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1064 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO FIRE PROTECTION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that in the aftermath of the August 2023 Lahaina wildfires, the department of the attorney general initiated an investigation and retained the independent, third-party Fire Safety Research Institute, part of UL Research Institutes, to assess the performance of state and county agencies in preparing for and responding to the August 2023 Lahaina wildfires.  The investigation led to three reports -- a "Phase 1" comprehensive timeline report, a "Phase 2" incident analysis report, and a "Phase 3" forward-looking report. The "Phase 3" forward-looking report organized these findings and provided a prioritized list of action items of changes to be made to improve Hawaii's response to wildfires for the State and all counties.  The report calls for changes and improvements to the office of the state fire marshal, which was established by Act 209, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024  among them, bolstering statutory authority of the office of the state fire marshal to address the wide spectrum of fire safety issues, delineating responsibilities and reporting structures between the state fire marshal and the state fire council, and creating an organizational structure to immediately address the State's fire-safety priorities effectively. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to effectuate the recommendations of the "Phase 3" forward-looking report.
