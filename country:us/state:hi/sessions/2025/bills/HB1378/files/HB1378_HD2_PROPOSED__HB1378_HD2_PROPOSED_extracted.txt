BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the mission of the state foundation on culture and the arts is to promote, perpetuate, preserve, and encourage culture and the arts as central to the quality of life and people of the State.  One of the foundation's strategic priorities includes increasing public accessibility to arts and culture. The foundation administers the state art museum and the art in public places and relocatable works of art programs, using the works of art special fund created pursuant to section 103‑8.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, and also issues grants through its foundation grants program.  The museum and these programs aim to support, promote, and recognize the excellence of the State's diverse artists; create, display, and maintain in public places and the state art museum a collection of works of art that represent the diversity and excellence of the State's artistic expression; and provide the fullest possible access to the highest quality aesthetic and educational experiences available to all the citizens of the State. The legislature further finds that the performing arts also represent various mediums that express creativity through singing, dancing, theatre, and musical performances.  To ensure a wide range of artistic creativity and expression in the State, performing arts should also be recognized as a medium to provide the State's residents and visitors with creative, educational, and aesthetic performances that tell meaningful stories and provide engaging experiences.
