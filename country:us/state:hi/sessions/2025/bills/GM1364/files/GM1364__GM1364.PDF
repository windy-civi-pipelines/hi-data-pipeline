THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
CD. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO SEXUAL EXPLOITATION.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that sex trafficking is a
2 form of modern-day slavery. According to a 2018 report
3 published by Arizona State University and the Hawaii state
4 commission on the status of women, one out of every eleven adult
5 male residents of the State are online sex shoppers. The report
6 also estimated that there were 74,362 potential sex buyers in
7 the State. Moreover, Imua Alliance, a victim service provider
8 for survivors of sex trafficking and sexual violence, estimates
9 that one hundred fifty establishments participate in the
10 commercial sex trade in the State, increasing the high risk for
11 sex trafficking. During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic,
12 a service provider for sex trafficking victims in the State
13 reported seeing a three hundred per cent increase in demand for
14 services.
15 The legislature additionally finds that Pacific Islanders,
16 specifically Native Hawaiians, are disproportionately
17 overrepresented in the State's sex trafficking survivor

1 population. In a survey conducted by the Hawaii state
2 commission on the status of women and Arizona State University,
3 sixty-four per cent of sex trafficking victims identified as
4 having at least partial Native Hawaiian ancestry. According to
5 the report, "overutilization of Native Hawaiians to meet sex
6 buyer demand may be directly linked to structural economic
7 coercion and vulnerabilities connected to land dispossession,
8 exposure to sexual violence, hypersexualization, incarceration,
9 cultural dislocation, intergenerational trauma, mental and
10 emotional distress, racism, poverty, and ongoing inequities".
11 The legislature further finds that victims of sex
12 trafficking should not be criminalized for their own
13 exploitation. Immunizing sex trafficking survivors from being
14 faced with the prospect of prosecution advances the delivery of
15 social services and trauma-informed care for those in need. It
16 would also help to end the social stigma that retraumatizes
17 survivors of sexual exploitation, while empowering victims to
18 obtain financial security for the harm that they have endured
19 and pursue legal persons and commercial entities that profit
20 from exploitation.
