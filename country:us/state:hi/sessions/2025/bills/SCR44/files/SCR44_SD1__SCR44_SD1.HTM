SCR44 SD1 THE SENATE S.C.R. NO. 44 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION requesting the SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES STANDING COMMITTEE WHOSE PURVIEW INCLUDES CONSUMER PROTECTION, with the support of the legislative reference bureau, to convene a LEGISLATIVE working group to determine recommendations for establishing appropriate family notice and standardized consent provisions for pre‑need contracts governing cremation. WHEREAS, advances in medical technology, including the use of metal implants, are contributing to the increased quality and longevity of life of the State's population; and WHEREAS, mortuaries are increasingly faced with the need to dispose of metal implants after cremation; and WHEREAS, given the frequent use of cremation as the preferred method for the final arrangement of the deceased, the disposition of incombustible metal surgical implants represents a new issue as metal implants are not included with the ash remains returned to the family in an urn;

and WHEREAS, the promotion of ethical practices that require communication and consent on the part of cremation service providers prevents any potential misuse or unauthorized sale of incombustible metal implants or precious metals therein;

(2)  Propose definitions for incombustible metal implants that remain following cremation; (3)  Recommend contract provisions that mortuaries in the State should include in pre-need contracts which designated family representatives sign to express their preferences and decisions regarding the disposition of metal implants that remain following cremation; (4)  Report on current practices employed by mortuaries that sell accumulated incombustible metal surgical implants in bulk and report revenue generated from the sale of incombustible metal surgical implants; (5)  Identify conditions that may impact the quality and quantity of metal fragments during cremation and recommend the appropriate recycling or disposition of incombustible metal surgical implants; (6)  Recommend best practices for estate planners, senior advocacy groups, and eldercare attorneys addressing health care directives and wills in addressing decisions related to cremation services and the disposition of metal implants, including donations of income from disposed metal implants to a designated nonprofit organization;
