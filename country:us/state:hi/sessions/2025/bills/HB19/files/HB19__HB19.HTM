Section 1:
HB19 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 19 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to tourism. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that in October 2023, the department of business, economic development, and tourism and the Hawaii tourism authority issued request for proposals No. 24-07, entitled "HTA Governance Study", to "determine the ideal governance structure to be effective in destination marketing and tourism management." The legislature further finds that the contract was awarded on December 15, 2023, to Better Destinations, LLC, which then issued surveys, conducted interviews, and held workshops.  Better Destinations, LLC, then issued a report in June 2024 entitled "Governance with Aloha:  A Report and Recommendations for Guiding Destination Stewardship of Hawai`i".  The report set forth eleven recommendations, the third of which was to reorganize the Hawaii tourism authority as a destination stewardship organization that is also a nonprofit organization.  The nonprofit structure would be similar to the counterpart tourism organizations of California, Florida, and Puerto Rico, which are nonprofit organizations authorized by statute and tied to government oversight.  However, rather than being tasked with marketing the destination and increasing tourism, the Hawaii nonprofit would instead guide Hawaii's visitor economy in collaboration with public, private, nonprofit, and community stakeholders in achieving beneficial outcomes from tourism, based on the principles of destination stewardship and regenerative tourism. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to implement the third recommendation of the governance study by reorganizing the Hawaii tourism authority as a nonprofit destination stewardship organization.

Raw Text:
HB19 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 19 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to tourism. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that in October 2023, the department of business, economic development, and tourism and the Hawaii tourism authority issued request for proposals No. 24-07, entitled "HTA Governance Study", to "determine the ideal governance structure to be effective in destination marketing and tourism management." The legislature further finds that the contract was awarded on December 15, 2023, to Better Destinations, LLC, which then issued surveys, conducted interviews, and held workshops.  Better Destinations, LLC, then issued a report in June 2024 entitled "Governance with Aloha:  A Report and Recommendations for Guiding Destination Stewardship of Hawai`i".  The report set forth eleven recommendations, the third of which was to reorganize the Hawaii tourism authority as a destination stewardship organization that is also a nonprofit organization.  The nonprofit structure would be similar to the counterpart tourism organizations of California, Florida, and Puerto Rico, which are nonprofit organizations authorized by statute and tied to government oversight.  However, rather than being tasked with marketing the destination and increasing tourism, the Hawaii nonprofit would instead guide Hawaii's visitor economy in collaboration with public, private, nonprofit, and community stakeholders in achieving beneficial outcomes from tourism, based on the principles of destination stewardship and regenerative tourism. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to implement the third recommendation of the governance study by reorganizing the Hawaii tourism authority as a nonprofit destination stewardship organization.
