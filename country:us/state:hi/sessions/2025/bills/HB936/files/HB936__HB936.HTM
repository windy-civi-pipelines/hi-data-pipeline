Section 1:
HB936 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 936 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to financial literacy. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that financial literacy is a critical skill for ensuring personal and societal financial stability.  Many students graduate without essential knowledge of budgeting, saving, investing, or managing credit, which impacts their ability to achieve financial independence.  To equip students with these essential skills, mandating financial literacy education as part of the high school curriculum is necessary. The legislature further finds that financial literacy empowers students to effectively manage a budget, enabling them to make informed decisions about spending and saving.  In Hawaii, where the cost of living is among the highest in the nation, these skills are particularly vital for maintaining financial well-being.  The legislature believes that teaching students how to balance the demands of daily expenses, housing costs, and long-term financial goals will ensure students are better prepared to thrive economically in their communities. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to ensure students are equipped to navigate complex financial challenges and contribute to a stable economy by requiring the department of education to develop and implement a statewide financial literacy curricula plan for public high schools. SECTION 2.  Chapter 302A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part II, subpart B, to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§302A-     Financial literacy; curricula plan; public schools. (a)  The department shall develop and implement a statewide financial literacy curricula plan for public school students in grades nine through twelve.  The department shall review and determine into which courses personal financial literacy shall be integrated. (b) Beginning with the 2026-2027 school year, all public high schools shall offer instruction in financial literacy as a requirement for graduation.  The curriculum shall include, at a minimum, the following topics: (1)  Basic budgeting and financial planning; (2)  Saving, investing, and retirement planning; (3)  Credit management, including credit scoring and debt management; (4)  Understanding taxes and tax planning; (5)  Loans and interest, including mortgages, car loans, and student loans; (6)  Fraud prevention and identity theft; and (7)  Economic principles and entrepreneurship. Public high schools may integrate financial literacy into existing coursework, including in the personal transition plan requirement for students; provided that the topics listed in this subsection are fully covered in the coursework. (c) The department shall provide professional development opportunities for teachers on financial literacy, including: (1)  Workshops, summer programs, and online resources; and (2)  Approved training from national and state‑level financial education organizations.

(h)  The board shall adopt rules in accordance with chapter 91 necessary to implement this section.
