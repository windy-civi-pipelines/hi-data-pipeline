Section 1:
HB1459 HD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1459 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that aviation accounts for the majority of the State's carbon pollution.  As an island state dependent on air travel for connectivity, Hawaii must take steps to reduce aviation-related emissions to meet the State's commitment to achieving a net-negative carbon economy by 2045. Sustainable aviation fuel offers a viable pathway to reduce the environmental impact of air travel while supporting innovation and economic development in Hawaii's clean energy sector.  Furthermore, local agricultural producers, entrepreneurs, and refineries have made significant investments in research, facilities, and infrastructure to develop locally produced sustainable aviation fuel. The purpose of this Act is to require commercial airlines operating intrastate flights in the State to utilize at least ten per cent sustainable aviation fuel in intrastate airline flights beginning January 1, 2030. SECTION 2.  Chapter 261E, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§261E-     Sustainable aviation fuel; requirements; intrastate flights.  (a)  Beginning January 1, 2030, any commercial airline operating intrastate airline flights in the State shall utilize at least ten per cent sustainable aviation fuel in intrastate airline flights operated in the State. (b) Nothing in this section shall preclude airlines from qualifying for tax incentives or grants under state programs promoting clean energy and greenhouse gas reductions. (c) The department of transportation, in consultation with the Hawaii state energy office, shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to implement this section; provided that the rules include: (1)  Procedures for monitoring and reporting fuel usage and sustainable aviation fuel compliance; (2)  Certification processes for sustainable aviation fuel; and (3)  Penalties for noncompliance. (d) The department of transportation shall submit an annual report to the legislature, no later than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular session, on the progress of sustainable aviation fuel adoption, compliance rates, economic impacts, and recommendations for further legislative action. (e) For the purposes of this section, "sustainable aviation fuel" means liquid fuel that: (1)  Consists of synthesized hydrocarbons and meets the requirements of the American Society for Testing and Materials International Standard D7566 or D1655; and (2)  Is derived from biomass resources, waste streams, renewable or zero carbon energy sources, or gaseous carbon oxides." SECTION 3.  New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 3000. Report Title: DOT; Sustainable Aviation Fuel; Commercial Airlines; Intrastate Travel Description: Requires commercial airlines operating intrastate flights in the State to utilize at least ten per cent sustainable aviation fuel in intrastate airline flights beginning 1/1/2030.  Effective 7/1/3000.  (HD1) The summary description of legislation appearing on this page is for informational purposes only and is not legislation or evidence of legislative intent.
