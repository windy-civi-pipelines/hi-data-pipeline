HB729 HD2 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 729 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 2 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO MARRIAGE OF MINORS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that nationally and internationally there is growing recognition that child marriage is a human rights violation and a severe impediment to social and economic development, resulting in states and countries considering legislation to end the practice of allowing children to marry.  The United Nations Children's Fund describes child marriage as any formal marriage or informal union between a child under the age of eighteen and an adult or another child.  United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 5, relating to gender equality, sets the year 2030 as the target for ending child marriage.  The Sustainable Development goals were unanimously adopted in 2015 by all one hundred ninety-three United Nations member states including the United States. The concerns about allowing children to marry is that they have not reached the threshold of adulthood that grants certain rights and responsibilities and that a child entering into marriage may have been pressured or coerced into marrying, especially if the child is pregnant, or the marriage may be the result of sex trafficking.  According to an analysis conducted by the Public Broadcasting Service's Frontline program, between 2000 and 2015 more than two hundred seven thousand individuals under the age of eighteen married in the United States.  While most children were sixteen or seventeen years of age at the time of marriage, some were as young as twelve years old.  Girls are disproportionately affected by the practice of child marriage, and the vast majority of these marriages were between a minor female and an adult male. Hawaii's laws regularly define "children" as persons who are less than eighteen years of age; they are often also termed "minors". Nonetheless, the law allows children as young as sixteen years of age to marry.  State law further authorizes the family court to approve a marriage of a child who is fifteen years of age.  Comparatively, sexual assault laws criminalize sexual conduct with a fifteen-year-old, though an exception is made if the fifteen-year-old is legally married to the sexual partner or the sexual partner is not more than five years older than the minor victim.  Based on department of health data, at least eight hundred children were married in Hawaii since 2000, with eighty per cent of these marriages being girls marrying adult men. The legislature further finds that in 2018, Delaware and New Jersey became the first and second states, respectively, to require that both parties to the marriage be at least eighteen years of age at time of marriage.  Since then, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Rhode Island, New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut, Michigan, Washington, Virginia, and New Hampshire, along with American Samoa and the United States Virgin Islands, have joined them to end child marriage in their jurisdictions. Similar legislation has been introduced in several other states as well as Congress. The purpose of this Act is to: (1)  End child marriage in Hawaii; and (2)  Repeal exemptions for sexual assaullt of a minor if the prepretrator is married to the minor. SECTION 2.  Section 560:5-208, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows: "(b)  A guardian may: (1)  Apply for and receive money for the support of the ward otherwise payable to the ward's parent, guardian, or custodian under the terms of any statutory system of benefits or insurance or any private contract, devise, trust, conservatorship, or custodianship; (2)  If otherwise consistent with the terms of any order by a court of competent jurisdiction relating to custody of the ward, take custody of the ward and establish the ward's place of custodial dwelling; provided that a guardian may only establish or move the ward's custodial dwelling outside the State upon express authorization of the court; (3)  If a conservator for the estate of a ward has not been appointed with existing authority, commence a proceeding, including an administrative proceeding, or take other appropriate action to compel a person to support the ward or to pay money for the benefit of the ward; (4)  Consent to medical or other care, treatment, or service for the ward; [(5)  Consent to the marriage of the ward;] and [(6)] (5)  If reasonable under all of the circumstances, delegate to the ward certain responsibilities for decisions affecting the ward's well-being."

By amending the definition of "residual parental rights and responsibilities" to read: ""Residual parental rights and responsibilities" means those rights and responsibilities remaining with the parent after the transfer of legal custody or guardianship of the person, including[,] but not [necessarily] limited to[,] the right to reasonable visitation, consent to adoption [or marriage], and the responsibility for support."
