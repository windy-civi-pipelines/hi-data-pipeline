Section 1:
HB950 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 950 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to bi-level lighting systems. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that in many private and public buildings across the State, lighting systems remain active at full intensity throughout the day and night. This practice results in considerable energy waste, increased electricity costs, and unnecessary environmental harm.  The legislature further finds that the State must take action to prevent these inefficiencies and promote sensible environmental stewardship practices. Motion-censored lighting systems, or bi-level lighting, offer a proven, environmentally friendly alternative to traditional lighting systems.  These systems operate by decreasing and increasing lighting intensity through motion sensors, increasing brightness as needed. While these kinds of systems have been adopted on a small scale, the State should be actively pursuing opportunities to increase bi-level lighting usage. The purpose of this Act is to require all newly constructed state buildings and facilities to use only bi-level lighting systems beginning January 1, 2026. SECTION 2.  Chapter 196, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§196-     Bi-level lighting system; state buildings and facilities; required.  Beginning January 1, 2026, all newly constructed state buildings and facilities shall use only bi-level lighting systems. For the purposes of this subsection, "bi-level lighting systems" means energy-efficient lighting systems that use motion sensors to switch between distinct lighting intensity levels." SECTION 3.  New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval. INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________ Report Title: Bi-level Lighting Systems; State Buildings; State Facilities; Energy Efficiency Description: Requires all newly constructed state buildings and facilities to use only bi-level lighting systems beginning 1/1/2026. The summary description of legislation appearing on this page is for informational purposes only and is not legislation or evidence of legislative intent.
