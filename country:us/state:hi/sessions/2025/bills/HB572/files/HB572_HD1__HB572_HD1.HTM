HB572 HD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 572 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO GENERAL EXCISE TAX. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii has the highest cost of living in the nation.  The general excise tax is levied on nearly all economic activity, which is passed on to customers in the form of higher prices.  This can be alleviated by exempting food and medical services. According to the Consumer Price Index, grocery prices in Hawaii are fifty per cent higher than the national average.  Between 2021 and 2022, households in the Honolulu area spent an average of 17.3 per cent of their expenditure on food.  In comparison, the average American spent 12.6 per cent on food.  According to the United States Department of Agriculture, a Hawaii family of four on the Thrifty Food Plan spending $1,431.00 per month on food would save over $687 each year if food were exempt from the general excise tax. Thirty-nine states plus the District of Columbia exempt groceries from their sales taxes, and another five states tax groceries at lower rates than other goods.  The legislature finds that it is time for Hawaii to join this majority. Health care further contributes to the higher cost of living.  Hawaii is one of only a handful of states that tax medical services and, until the enactment of Act 47, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024 (Act 47), the only state to tax medicare services.  Act 47 exempted medical and dental services covered by medicare, medicaid, and TRICARE from the general excise tax.  A broader exemption on all medical and dental services would lighten the tax burden on privately practicing medical providers and address Hawaii's health professional shortage by incentivizing qualified physicians to practice in the State, thus resulting in lower health care costs to patients.  According to a study commissioned by the Grassroot Institute of Hawaii, Hawaii residents and health care professionals would receive a $222,000,000 tax cut if medical services were exempt from the general excise tax. The State's current general surplus of $1,000,000,000 and projected continued surplus over the next three fiscal years position the State to responsibly adopt the proposed tax exemptions.  The purpose of this Act is to exempt food and medical services from the general excise tax to lower the cost of living for Hawaii families. SECTION 2.  Chapter 237, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§237-     Exemption of gross proceeds of sales on food and groceries.  (a)  There shall be exempted from, and excluded from the measure of, the taxes imposed by this chapter all of the gross proceeds arising from the sale of food and groceries. (b)  This chapter shall apply to food or groceries that are furnished, prepared, or served as meals, except: (1)  In the case of persons sixty years of age or over, or who receive supplemental security income benefits, or disability or blindness payments under Title I, II, X, XIV, or XVI or the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 et set., 401 et seq., 1201 et seq., 1351 et seq., 1381 et seq.) and their spouses, meals prepared by and served in senior citizen's centers, apartment buildings occupied primarily by such persons, public or private nonprofit establishments that feed such persons, private establishments that contract with the appropriate agency of the State to offer meals for such persons at concessional prices, and meals prepared for and served to residents of federally subsidized housing for the elderly; (2)  In the case of persons sixty years of age or over and persons who are physically or mentally handicapped or otherwise disabled in a way that they are unable to adequately prepare all of their meals, meals prepared for and delivered to them and their spouses at their home by a public or private nonprofit organization or by a private establishment that contracts with the appropriate state agency to perform such services at concessional prices; (3)  In the case of disabled or blind recipients of benefits under Title I, II, X, XIV, or XVI or the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 et set., 401 et seq., 1201 et seq., 1351 et seq., 1381 et seq.), who are residents in a public or private nonprofit organization living arrangement that serves no more than sixteen residents and is certified by the appropriate state agency or agencies, meals prepared and served under such arrangement; (4)  In the case of women and children temporarily residing in public or private nonprofit organization shelters for battered women and children, meals prepared and served by such shelters; and (5)  In the case of households that do not reside in permanent dwellings and households that have no fixed mailing addresses, meals prepared for and served by a public or private nonprofit organization approved by an appropriate state or local agency that feeds such individuals or by private establishments that contract with the appropriate agency of the State to offer meals for such individuals at concessional prices.
