NO. 67 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION requesting the Department of Human Resources Development and the state agencies comprising the State's public mental health care system to cooperate more closely to determine the necessary actions to expedite THE hiring AND FILLING OF CRITICAL VACANCIES, INCLUDING SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS the obstacles and challenges unique to the mental health care workforce. WHEREAS, the workforce shortage affecting the State and its agencies is the product of numerous identifiable problems and challenges, including obsolete and unproductive recruiting and hiring policies and practices; and WHEREAS, the quality of the State's public mental health care system has diminished, in part due to hiring practices and policies that make it challenging for state agencies to hire and retain the skilled professionals essential to providing effective mental health care services, affecting a range of critical roles, ultimately undermining the system's ability to meet the needs of the community; and WHEREAS, the Department of Health, Department of Human Services, Department of Education, Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, the Judiciary, and other agencies that constitute the Continuum of Care in the State are in desperate need of support as high vacancy rates prevent these agencies from meeting the increasing demand for mental health care services; and WHEREAS, in addition to the challenges posed by the current workforce shortage, persisting stigmas surrounding mental illnesses and mental health care discourage potential applicants and limit the ability of these agencies to attract applicants; and WHEREAS, providing care to individuals with serious mental illnesses, emotional disorders, and potentially co-occurring chronic conditions, is a challenging and exhausting occupation that often causes workers to experience burnout, compassion fatigue, post-traumatic stress, and the development or exacerbation of other mental health conditions, which high vacancy rates can accelerate or further exacerbate; and WHEREAS, it is critical that the State effectively recruit and retain additional public mental health care system employees to relieve current employees and deliver more effective mental health care services in the State; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the Thirty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2025, the House of Representatives concurring, that the Department of Human Resources Development and the state agencies comprising the State's public mental health care system are requested to cooperate more closely to determine the necessary actions to expedite the hiring and filling of critical vacancies, including solutions to address the obstacles and challenges unique to the mental health care workforce; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a certified copy of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Director of Human Resources Development, Director of Health, Director of Human Services, Superintendent of Education, Director of Corrections and Rehabilitation, and Chief Justice.
