Section 1:
SB1322 SD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1322 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO MENTAL HEALTH. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii's mental health laws provide the State with a variety of methods to help and support individuals suffering from mental illness or substance abuse.  As the number of individuals in need of help increases, so has the need to enhance these laws in a manner that demystifies the complexities of existing procedures, clarifies the circumstances under which action can be taken, and bolsters available tools to best serve these individuals.  Legal mechanisms, such as emergency procedures, involuntary hospitalization, assisted community treatment, and authorization for the administration of treatment, enables the State and mental health providers to provide compassionate assistance to individuals suffering from mental illness or substance abuse when they need it the most. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to clarify, update, and revise Hawaii's mental health laws by: (1)  Clarifying the procedures and expanding on the circumstances available from initial contact with an individual suffering from mental illness or substance abuse to emergency transportation, examination, and hospitalization of the individual; (2)  Establishing liability limits for state and local governments and health care professionals under certain circumstances arising from emergency procedures; (3)  Expanding the notice requirements when an emergency hospitalization occurs to include an individual's health care surrogate, as well as clarifying when the individual can waive notice to the individual's family members; (4)  Removing the authority of the family court to appoint a legal guardian or conservator in a proceeding for involuntary hospitalization, thereby leaving appointments for legal guardians or conservators subject to the requirements of chapter 560, article V, Hawaii Revised Statutes; (5)  Removing the requirement that psychiatric facilities wait for responses from interested parties to a notice of intent to discharge a patient under involuntary hospitalization before discharging the patient; (6)  Clarifying the circumstances under which a subject of an order for assisted community treatment can be administered medication over the subject's objection; (7)  Providing limits on liability for an assisted community treatment provider; and (8)  Modifying the requirements to obtain administrative authorization of medical treatment over the objection of a patient who is in the custody of the director and in a psychiatric facility, so that the treatment can be authorized by a single decision-maker who is a psychiatrist. SECTION 2.  Chapter 334, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended as follows: 1.  By adding a new subpart to part IV to be designated as subpart A and to read: "A.  Emergency Procedures §334-A  Emergency procedures.  The emergency procedures in this subpart shall consist of emergency transportation, emergency examination, and emergency hospitalization for individuals who may be mentally ill or suffering from substance abuse and imminently dangerous to self or others. §334-B  Emergency transportation initiated by a law enforcement officer.  (a)  When a law enforcement officer has a reasonable suspicion that an individual is imminently dangerous to self or others and needs to be detained for emergency examination, the law enforcement officer shall contact a mental health emergency worker; provided that the law enforcement officer may temporarily detain the individual, if the law enforcement officer: (1)  Is unable to reach a mental health emergency worker telephonically after three attempts; (2)  Has reason to believe that the situation requires immediate intervention to prevent harm to the individual or others; (3)  Contacts a mental health emergency worker at the earliest time possible; and (4)  Documents the reasons why the situation necessitated that the individual be detained. If the mental health emergency worker determines that the individual is mentally ill or suffering from substance abuse and is imminently dangerous to self or others, the law enforcement officer shall detain the individual for transportation to an emergency examination. (b)  When a crisis intervention officer has probable cause to believe that an individual is mentally ill or suffering from substance abuse and is imminently dangerous to self or others, the crisis intervention officer shall detain the individual for transportation to an emergency examination.  The crisis intervention officer shall contact a mental health emergency worker to determine the type of facility where the individual shall be transported. (c)  Any individual detained under this section shall be transported directly to a psychiatric facility or other facility designated by the director, as determined by a mental health emergency worker; provided that if a medical emergency occurs during transport the individual shall be transported to the nearest emergency department.  A law enforcement officer shall make an application for the emergency examination of the individual.  The application shall state in detail the circumstances under which and reasons that the individual was taken into custody.  The application shall be transmitted with the individual to the psychiatric facility or other facility designated by the director and be made a part of the individual's clinical record. (d)  For the purposes of this section, "crisis intervention officer" has the same meaning as defined in section 353C-1. §334-C  Emergency transportation initiated by a court order.  Upon written or oral application of any licensed physician, advanced practice registered nurse, psychologist, attorney, member of the clergy, health or social service professional, or any state or county employee in the course of employment, a judge may issue a written or oral ex parte order: (1)  Stating that there is probable cause that the individual is: (A)  Mentally ill or suffering from substance abuse; and (B)  Imminently dangerous to self or others; (2)  Stating the findings upon which the conclusion is based; and (3)  Directing that a law enforcement officer take the individual into custody and transport the individual directly to a psychiatric facility or other facility designated by the director for an emergency examination. If an application was made orally, the person who made the application shall reduce the application to writing and submit it to the judge who issued the ex parte order by noon of the next court day after the order was issued.  The written application shall be made under penalty of law but need not be sworn before a notary public.  If the judge issued an ex parte order orally, the judge shall reduce the oral order to writing by the close of the next court day after the order was issued.  The written ex parte order shall be transmitted with the individual to the psychiatric facility or other facility designated by the director and be made a part of the individual's clinical record. §334-D  Emergency examination.  (a)  A licensed physician, medical resident under the supervision of a licensed physician, or advanced practice registered nurse may conduct an initial examination and screening of the patient, and administer such treatment as indicated by good medical practice; provided that the patient is further examined by a qualified psychiatric examiner.  A qualified psychiatric examiner shall conduct an emergency examination of a patient transported under section 334-B or 334-C without unnecessary delay and provide the patient with treatment, as is indicated by good medical practice; provided that the emergency examination shall include a screening to determine whether the patient meets the criteria for involuntary hospitalization as provided in section 334-60.2. (b)  If, following an emergency examination of a patient under subsection (a), a qualified psychiatric examiner determines that the criteria for involuntary hospitalization do not exist, the patient shall be discharged expeditiously; provided that if the patient is not under an order for assisted community treatment, a qualified psychiatric examiner shall conduct an examination pursuant to section 334-121.5 before the discharge. A patient under criminal charges shall be returned to the custody of a law enforcement officer. §334-E  Emergency hospitalization.  (a)  If, following an emergency examination pursuant to section 334-D(a), a qualified psychiatric examiner determines that the criteria for involuntary hospitalization exist, the patient shall be hospitalized on an emergency basis or be transferred to another psychiatric facility or other facility designated by the director for emergency hospitalization. (b)  The patient admitted under subsection (a) shall be released within seventy-two hours of the patient's admission to a psychiatric facility or other facility designated by the director, unless: (1)  The patient voluntarily agrees to further hospitalization; or (2)  A proceeding for court-ordered evaluation or hospitalization is initiated as provided in section 334-60.3.  If that time expires on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the time for initiation shall be extended to the close of the next court day.  Upon initiation of the proceeding the facility may detain the patient until further order of the court. (c)  If at any time during the period of emergency hospitalization a qualified psychiatric examiner determines that a patient no longer meets the criteria for emergency hospitalization, the patient shall be discharged expeditiously; provided that if the patient is not under an order for assisted community treatment, a qualified psychiatric examiner shall conduct an examination pursuant to section 334-121.5 before the discharge. A patient under criminal charges shall be returned to the custody of a law enforcement officer. (d)  The patient shall have the right, immediately upon emergency hospitalization, to telephone an attorney and the patient's surrogate, guardian, family member including a reciprocal beneficiary, or adult friend.  The patient shall be allowed to confer with an attorney in private. §334-F  Notice of emergency transportation, examination, and hospitalization. Notice of an individual's emergency transportation, examination, and hospitalization under this subpart may be given to at least one of the following persons in the following order of priority:  the individual's spouse or reciprocal beneficiary, legal parents, adult children, surrogate, legal guardian, or if none can be found, the closest adult relative, as long as the individual: (1)  Has capacity to make health care decisions and consents that notice may be given to at least one of persons listed in this section; (2)  Is given the opportunity to object and does not object, or the health care provider can reasonably infer from the circumstances based on the exercise of professional judgment that the individual does not object; or (3)  Is incapacitated or an emergency circumstance exists, and the health care provider determines based on the exercise of professional judgment that giving notification is in the best interest of the individual. The staff of the facility shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the patient's family, including a reciprocal beneficiary, is notified of the emergency hospitalization, unless the patient is an adult and waives notification. §334-G  Immunity from liability.  The State, any county, any private sector or nonprofit organization, and, except in cases of willful misconduct, gross negligence, or recklessness, any state or county employee, health care provider, or mental health professional shall not be held civilly liable, either personally or in their official capacity, for the death of or injury to the individual, claim for damage to or loss of property, or other civil liability as the result of any act or omission in the course of the employment or duties under this subpart." 2.  By designating section 334-60.1 as subpart B and inserting a title before section 334-60.1 to read: "B.  Voluntary Admission" 3.  By designating section 334-60.2 to 334-60.7 as subpart C and inserting a title before section 334-60.2 to read: "C.  Involuntary Hospitalization" 4.  By designating section 334-61 to 334-62 as subpart D and inserting a title before section 334-61 to read: "D.  General Provisions" SECTION 3.

(b)  The time and form of the procedure incident to hearing the issues in the petition shall be provided by court rule.  Unless the hearing is waived, the judge shall hear the petition as soon as possible and no later than ten days after the date the petition is filed unless a reasonable delay is sought for good cause shown by the subject of the petition, the subject's attorney, or those persons entitled to receive notice of the hearing under section 334-60.4. (c)  The subject of the petition shall be present at all hearings unless the subject waives the right to be present, is unable to attend, or creates conditions that make it impossible to conduct [the] a hearing in a reasonable manner as determined by the judge.  A waiver is valid only upon acceptance by the court following a judicial determination that the subject understands the subject's rights and is competent to waive them, or is unable to participate.  If the subject is unable to participate, the judge shall appoint a guardian ad litem or a temporary guardian as provided in article V of chapter 560, to represent the subject throughout the proceedings. (d)  Hearings may be held at any convenient place within the circuit. Unless the court determines personal appearance is necessary, hearings may be conducted by video conferencing.

(f)  Counsel for the subject of the petition shall be allowed adequate time for investigation of the matters at issue and for preparation[,] and shall be permitted to present the evidence that the counsel believes necessary to a proper disposition of the proceedings, including evidence as to alternatives to inpatient hospitalization. (g)  No individual may be found to require treatment in a psychiatric facility unless at least one [physician, advanced practice registered nurse,] qualified psychiatric examiner or psychologist who has personally examined the individual testifies in person at the hearing.  This testimony may be waived by the subject of the petition.  If the subject of the petition [has refused] refuses to be examined by a [licensed physician, advanced practice registered nurse,] qualified psychiatric examiner or psychologist, the subject may be examined by a court-appointed [licensed physician, advanced practice registered nurse,] qualified psychiatric examiner or psychologist.  If the subject refuses to be examined and there is sufficient evidence to believe that the allegations of the petition are true, the court may make a temporary order committing the subject to a psychiatric facility for a period of no more than five days for the purpose of a diagnostic examination [and evaluation].  The subject's refusal to be examined shall be treated as a denial that the subject is mentally ill or suffering from substance abuse.  Nothing in this section shall limit the [individual's] subject's privilege against self-incrimination. (h)  The subject of the petition in a hearing under this section has the right to secure an independent [medical or psychological evaluation] examination and present evidence thereon. (i)  If after hearing all relevant evidence, including the result of any diagnostic examination ordered by the court, the court finds that [an individual] a subject of a petition is not a person requiring medical, psychiatric, psychological, or other rehabilitative treatment or supervision, the court shall order that the [individual] subject be discharged if the [individual] subject has been hospitalized prior to the hearing. (j)  If the court finds that the criteria for involuntary hospitalization under section 334-60.2(1) has been met beyond a reasonable doubt and that the criteria under [sections] section 334-60.2(2) and [334-60.2(3)] (3) have been met by clear and convincing evidence, the court may issue an order to any law enforcement officer to [deliver] transport the subject of the order to a facility that has agreed to admit the subject as an involuntary patient, or if the subject is already a patient in a psychiatric facility, authorize the facility to retain the patient for treatment for a period of ninety days unless sooner discharged.  The court may also authorize the involuntary administration of medication, where the subject has an existing order for assisted community treatment[,] issued pursuant to part VIII of this chapter[, relating to assisted community treatment,] and in accordance with the treatment prescribed by that [prior] existing order.  Notice of the subject's commitment and the facility name and location where the subject will be committed shall be provided to those persons entitled to notice pursuant to section 334-60.4.  An order of commitment shall specify which of those persons served with notice pursuant to section 334-60.4, together with such other persons as the court may designate, shall be entitled to receive any subsequent notice of intent to discharge, transfer, or recommit.  The court shall forward to the Hawaii criminal justice data center all orders of involuntary civil commitment or information from all orders of involuntary civil commitment, as requested by the Hawaii criminal justice data center, which in turn shall forward the information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or its successor agency, for inclusion in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System database.  The orders or information shall also be maintained by the Hawaii criminal justice data center for disclosure to and use by law enforcement officials for the purpose of firearms permitting, licensing, or registration pursuant to chapter 134.  This subsection shall apply to all involuntary civil commitments without regard to the date of the involuntary civil commitment. [(k)  The court may find that the subject of the petition is an incapacitated or protected person, or both, under article V of chapter 560, and may appoint a guardian or conservator, or both, for the subject under the terms and conditions as the court shall determine. (l)] (k)  Persons entitled to notice [are] pursuant to this section shall be also entitled to be present in the courtroom for the hearing and to receive a copy of the hearing transcript or recording, unless the court determines that the interests of justice require otherwise." SECTION 9.

Raw Text:
SB1322 SD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1322 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO MENTAL HEALTH. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii's mental health laws provide the State with a variety of methods to help and support individuals suffering from mental illness or substance abuse.  As the number of individuals in need of help increases, so has the need to enhance these laws in a manner that demystifies the complexities of existing procedures, clarifies the circumstances under which action can be taken, and bolsters available tools to best serve these individuals.  Legal mechanisms, such as emergency procedures, involuntary hospitalization, assisted community treatment, and authorization for the administration of treatment, enables the State and mental health providers to provide compassionate assistance to individuals suffering from mental illness or substance abuse when they need it the most. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to clarify, update, and revise Hawaii's mental health laws by: (1)  Clarifying the procedures and expanding on the circumstances available from initial contact with an individual suffering from mental illness or substance abuse to emergency transportation, examination, and hospitalization of the individual; (2)  Establishing liability limits for state and local governments and health care professionals under certain circumstances arising from emergency procedures; (3)  Expanding the notice requirements when an emergency hospitalization occurs to include an individual's health care surrogate, as well as clarifying when the individual can waive notice to the individual's family members; (4)  Removing the authority of the family court to appoint a legal guardian or conservator in a proceeding for involuntary hospitalization, thereby leaving appointments for legal guardians or conservators subject to the requirements of chapter 560, article V, Hawaii Revised Statutes; (5)  Removing the requirement that psychiatric facilities wait for responses from interested parties to a notice of intent to discharge a patient under involuntary hospitalization before discharging the patient; (6)  Clarifying the circumstances under which a subject of an order for assisted community treatment can be administered medication over the subject's objection; (7)  Providing limits on liability for an assisted community treatment provider; and (8)  Modifying the requirements to obtain administrative authorization of medical treatment over the objection of a patient who is in the custody of the director and in a psychiatric facility, so that the treatment can be authorized by a single decision-maker who is a psychiatrist. SECTION 2.  Chapter 334, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended as follows: 1.  By adding a new subpart to part IV to be designated as subpart A and to read: "A.  Emergency Procedures §334-A  Emergency procedures.  The emergency procedures in this subpart shall consist of emergency transportation, emergency examination, and emergency hospitalization for individuals who may be mentally ill or suffering from substance abuse and imminently dangerous to self or others. §334-B  Emergency transportation initiated by a law enforcement officer.  (a)  When a law enforcement officer has a reasonable suspicion that an individual is imminently dangerous to self or others and needs to be detained for emergency examination, the law enforcement officer shall contact a mental health emergency worker; provided that the law enforcement officer may temporarily detain the individual, if the law enforcement officer: (1)  Is unable to reach a mental health emergency worker telephonically after three attempts; (2)  Has reason to believe that the situation requires immediate intervention to prevent harm to the individual or others; (3)  Contacts a mental health emergency worker at the earliest time possible; and (4)  Documents the reasons why the situation necessitated that the individual be detained. If the mental health emergency worker determines that the individual is mentally ill or suffering from substance abuse and is imminently dangerous to self or others, the law enforcement officer shall detain the individual for transportation to an emergency examination. (b)  When a crisis intervention officer has probable cause to believe that an individual is mentally ill or suffering from substance abuse and is imminently dangerous to self or others, the crisis intervention officer shall detain the individual for transportation to an emergency examination.  The crisis intervention officer shall contact a mental health emergency worker to determine the type of facility where the individual shall be transported. (c)  Any individual detained under this section shall be transported directly to a psychiatric facility or other facility designated by the director, as determined by a mental health emergency worker; provided that if a medical emergency occurs during transport the individual shall be transported to the nearest emergency department.  A law enforcement officer shall make an application for the emergency examination of the individual.  The application shall state in detail the circumstances under which and reasons that the individual was taken into custody.  The application shall be transmitted with the individual to the psychiatric facility or other facility designated by the director and be made a part of the individual's clinical record. (d)  For the purposes of this section, "crisis intervention officer" has the same meaning as defined in section 353C-1. §334-C  Emergency transportation initiated by a court order.  Upon written or oral application of any licensed physician, advanced practice registered nurse, psychologist, attorney, member of the clergy, health or social service professional, or any state or county employee in the course of employment, a judge may issue a written or oral ex parte order: (1)  Stating that there is probable cause that the individual is: (A)  Mentally ill or suffering from substance abuse; and (B)  Imminently dangerous to self or others; (2)  Stating the findings upon which the conclusion is based; and (3)  Directing that a law enforcement officer take the individual into custody and transport the individual directly to a psychiatric facility or other facility designated by the director for an emergency examination. If an application was made orally, the person who made the application shall reduce the application to writing and submit it to the judge who issued the ex parte order by noon of the next court day after the order was issued.  The written application shall be made under penalty of law but need not be sworn before a notary public.  If the judge issued an ex parte order orally, the judge shall reduce the oral order to writing by the close of the next court day after the order was issued.  The written ex parte order shall be transmitted with the individual to the psychiatric facility or other facility designated by the director and be made a part of the individual's clinical record. §334-D  Emergency examination.  (a)  A licensed physician, medical resident under the supervision of a licensed physician, or advanced practice registered nurse may conduct an initial examination and screening of the patient, and administer such treatment as indicated by good medical practice; provided that the patient is further examined by a qualified psychiatric examiner.  A qualified psychiatric examiner shall conduct an emergency examination of a patient transported under section 334-B or 334-C without unnecessary delay and provide the patient with treatment, as is indicated by good medical practice; provided that the emergency examination shall include a screening to determine whether the patient meets the criteria for involuntary hospitalization as provided in section 334-60.2. (b)  If, following an emergency examination of a patient under subsection (a), a qualified psychiatric examiner determines that the criteria for involuntary hospitalization do not exist, the patient shall be discharged expeditiously; provided that if the patient is not under an order for assisted community treatment, a qualified psychiatric examiner shall conduct an examination pursuant to section 334-121.5 before the discharge. A patient under criminal charges shall be returned to the custody of a law enforcement officer. §334-E  Emergency hospitalization.  (a)  If, following an emergency examination pursuant to section 334-D(a), a qualified psychiatric examiner determines that the criteria for involuntary hospitalization exist, the patient shall be hospitalized on an emergency basis or be transferred to another psychiatric facility or other facility designated by the director for emergency hospitalization. (b)  The patient admitted under subsection (a) shall be released within seventy-two hours of the patient's admission to a psychiatric facility or other facility designated by the director, unless: (1)  The patient voluntarily agrees to further hospitalization; or (2)  A proceeding for court-ordered evaluation or hospitalization is initiated as provided in section 334-60.3.  If that time expires on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the time for initiation shall be extended to the close of the next court day.  Upon initiation of the proceeding the facility may detain the patient until further order of the court. (c)  If at any time during the period of emergency hospitalization a qualified psychiatric examiner determines that a patient no longer meets the criteria for emergency hospitalization, the patient shall be discharged expeditiously; provided that if the patient is not under an order for assisted community treatment, a qualified psychiatric examiner shall conduct an examination pursuant to section 334-121.5 before the discharge. A patient under criminal charges shall be returned to the custody of a law enforcement officer. (d)  The patient shall have the right, immediately upon emergency hospitalization, to telephone an attorney and the patient's surrogate, guardian, family member including a reciprocal beneficiary, or adult friend.  The patient shall be allowed to confer with an attorney in private. §334-F  Notice of emergency transportation, examination, and hospitalization.

The staff of the facility shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the patient's family, including a reciprocal beneficiary, is notified of the emergency hospitalization, unless the patient is an adult and waives notification. §334-G  Immunity from liability.  The State, any county, any private sector or nonprofit organization, and, except in cases of willful misconduct, gross negligence, or recklessness, any state or county employee, health care provider, or mental health professional shall not be held civilly liable, either personally or in their official capacity, for the death of or injury to the individual, claim for damage to or loss of property, or other civil liability as the result of any act or omission in the course of the employment or duties under this subpart." 2.  By designating section 334-60.1 as subpart B and inserting a title before section 334-60.1 to read: "B.  Voluntary Admission" 3.  By designating section 334-60.2 to 334-60.7 as subpart C and inserting a title before section 334-60.2 to read: "C.  Involuntary Hospitalization" 4.  By designating section 334-61 to 334-62 as subpart D and inserting a title before section 334-61 to read: "D.  General Provisions" SECTION 3.

(g)  No individual may be found to require treatment in a psychiatric facility unless at least one [physician, advanced practice registered nurse,] qualified psychiatric examiner or psychologist who has personally examined the individual testifies in person at the hearing.  This testimony may be waived by the subject of the petition.  If the subject of the petition [has refused] refuses to be examined by a [licensed physician, advanced practice registered nurse,] qualified psychiatric examiner or psychologist, the subject may be examined by a court-appointed [licensed physician, advanced practice registered nurse,] qualified psychiatric examiner or psychologist.  If the subject refuses to be examined and there is sufficient evidence to believe that the allegations of the petition are true, the court may make a temporary order committing the subject to a psychiatric facility for a period of no more than five days for the purpose of a diagnostic examination [and evaluation].  The subject's refusal to be examined shall be treated as a denial that the subject is mentally ill or suffering from substance abuse.  Nothing in this section shall limit the [individual's] subject's privilege against self-incrimination. (h)  The subject of the petition in a hearing under this section has the right to secure an independent [medical or psychological evaluation] examination and present evidence thereon. (i)  If after hearing all relevant evidence, including the result of any diagnostic examination ordered by the court, the court finds that [an individual] a subject of a petition is not a person requiring medical, psychiatric, psychological, or other rehabilitative treatment or supervision, the court shall order that the [individual] subject be discharged if the [individual] subject has been hospitalized prior to the hearing. (j)  If the court finds that the criteria for involuntary hospitalization under section 334-60.2(1) has been met beyond a reasonable doubt and that the criteria under [sections] section 334-60.2(2) and [334-60.2(3)] (3) have been met by clear and convincing evidence, the court may issue an order to any law enforcement officer to [deliver] transport the subject of the order to a facility that has agreed to admit the subject as an involuntary patient, or if the subject is already a patient in a psychiatric facility, authorize the facility to retain the patient for treatment for a period of ninety days unless sooner discharged.  The court may also authorize the involuntary administration of medication, where the subject has an existing order for assisted community treatment[,] issued pursuant to part VIII of this chapter[, relating to assisted community treatment,] and in accordance with the treatment prescribed by that [prior] existing order.  Notice of the subject's commitment and the facility name and location where the subject will be committed shall be provided to those persons entitled to notice pursuant to section 334-60.4.  An order of commitment shall specify which of those persons served with notice pursuant to section 334-60.4, together with such other persons as the court may designate, shall be entitled to receive any subsequent notice of intent to discharge, transfer, or recommit.  The court shall forward to the Hawaii criminal justice data center all orders of involuntary civil commitment or information from all orders of involuntary civil commitment, as requested by the Hawaii criminal justice data center, which in turn shall forward the information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or its successor agency, for inclusion in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System database.  The orders or information shall also be maintained by the Hawaii criminal justice data center for disclosure to and use by law enforcement officials for the purpose of firearms permitting, licensing, or registration pursuant to chapter 134.  This subsection shall apply to all involuntary civil commitments without regard to the date of the involuntary civil commitment. [(k)  The court may find that the subject of the petition is an incapacitated or protected person, or both, under article V of chapter 560, and may appoint a guardian or conservator, or both, for the subject under the terms and conditions as the court shall determine. (l)] (k)  Persons entitled to notice [are] pursuant to this section shall be also entitled to be present in the courtroom for the hearing and to receive a copy of the hearing transcript or recording, unless the court determines that the interests of justice require otherwise."

Once the law enforcement officer has gained control of the individual, the law enforcement officer shall call for assistance from a mental health emergency worker designated by the director; provided that the law enforcement officer shall document why the situation necessitated that the law enforcement officer gain control of the individual.  Upon determination by the mental health emergency worker that the person is imminently dangerous to self or others, the person shall be transported by ambulance or other suitable means to a licensed psychiatric facility or other facility designated by the director for further evaluation and possible emergency hospitalization.  If a crisis intervention officer has probable cause to believe that a person is imminently dangerous to self or others, the crisis intervention officer shall call a mental health emergency worker to determine if the person shall be transported by ambulance or other suitable means to a behavioral health crisis center designated by the director as determined by a mental health emergency worker.  A law enforcement officer may also take into custody and transport to any facility designated by the director any person threatening or attempting suicide.

(c)  Release from emergency examination.  If, after examination, the licensed physician, psychiatrist, or advanced practice registered nurse with prescriptive authority and who holds an accredited national certification in an advanced practice registered nurse psychiatric specialization determines that the involuntary hospitalization criteria set forth in section 334-60.2 are not met or do not persist and the examination pursuant to section 334-121.5, where required, has been completed, the patient shall be discharged expediently, unless the patient is under criminal charges, in which case the patient shall be returned to the custody of a law enforcement officer.

(e)  Release from emergency hospitalization.  If at any time during the period of emergency hospitalization the treating physician determines that the patient no longer meets the criteria for emergency hospitalization and the examination pursuant to section 334-121.5 has been completed, the physician shall expediently discharge the patient.  If the patient is under criminal charges, the patient shall be returned to the custody of a law enforcement officer.  In any event, the patient shall be released within forty-eight hours of the patient's admission to a psychiatric facility or other facility designated by the director, unless the patient voluntarily agrees to further hospitalization, or a proceeding for court-ordered evaluation or hospitalization, or both, is initiated as provided in section 334-60.3.  If that time expires on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the time for initiation is extended to the close of the next court day.  Upon initiation of the proceedings, the facility shall be authorized to detain the patient until further order of the court."] SECTION 27.
