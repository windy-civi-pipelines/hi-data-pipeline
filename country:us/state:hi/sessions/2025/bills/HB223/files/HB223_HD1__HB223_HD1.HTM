Section 1:
HB223 HD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 223 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO PHARMACY. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1. The legislature finds there is a need to support the Daniel K. Inouye college of pharmacy to ensure the quality of health care and improve access to care for the people of the State.  With further resources, the college can proactively address issues of the State's current health care crisis and leverage pharmacists to fill gaps in care related to medication management. Pharmacists are the most accessible health care providers and strongly embedded as a trusted resource in many remote communities.  The college could leverage pharmacists across the health care spectrum to recruit and retain highly qualified pharmacists to practice in the State, create a plan for an innovative pharmacy practice model, and serve as the resource for the pharmacy profession as the medical system shifts to a value and team-based care model where pharmacy will play an integral role in patient outcomes.

Inouye college of pharmacy to support pharmacist workforce assessment and planning efforts. SECTION 2.
