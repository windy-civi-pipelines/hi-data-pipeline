A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO UNIVERSAL IMMUNIZATION FUNDING PROGRAM.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that fourteen states have
2 adopted programs known as "Universal Purchase" or "Universal
3 Select" (collectively, UP), which provide state-purchased access
4 to some or all recommended immunizations to children and adults
5 in those states. UP immunization purchases occur at a
6 discounted price through contracts otherwise intended for more
7 established and familiar immunization purchasing programs such
8 as the Vaccines For Children Program (Public Law 103-66) and
9 Public Health Services Act, Section 317 Immunization Program
10 (Public Law 78-410) . Other varied state approaches include
11 superseding private sources of coverage and assessing health
12 insurance plans for the cost of the program and disallowing
13 provider use of private immunization stock.
14 The legislature further finds that states with UP programs
15 that allow state health officials to manage the supply of
16 immunizations lowered health care providers' administrative
17 costs and ensured that the states can quickly supply

3 health care and public health system make investment in a UP
4 program worthwhile.

6 immunization funding program in the State.
7 SECTION 2. Chapter 325, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
8 amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and
