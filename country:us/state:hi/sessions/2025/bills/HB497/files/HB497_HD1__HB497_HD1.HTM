Section 1:
HB497 HD1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 497 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 H.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE HAWAII CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the Hawaii child nutrition programs is the state agency link between the United States Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service and local program operators.  The agency conducts audits, provides technical assistance, and disburses federal funds while ensuring the programs are managed according to federal requirements. The legislature further finds that the Hawaii child nutrition programs has a critical role in ensuring the department of education reaches the programmatic goal established in Act 175, Session Laws of Hawaii 2021, to provide at least thirty per cent locally grown food in the State's public schools by 2030.  However, additional resources and staff dedicated to farm-to-school connections are needed to ensure the department of education meets its "30 by 30" goal. The legislature recognizes that the Hawaii child nutrition programs is an agency attached to the department of education under the board of education. The purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Establish the Hawaii child nutrition programs as an agency in the department of agriculture; and (2)  Fund grant-based programs to be administered through the Hawaii child nutrition programs.
