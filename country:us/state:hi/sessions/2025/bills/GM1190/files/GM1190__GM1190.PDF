STATE OF HAWAII S.D. 1
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO TAXATION.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION I. The legislature finds that the existing
2 taxation scheme on beer is confusing, burdensome, and unfairly
3 discriminatory. A lower tax rate is imposed on draft beer,
4 which is statutorily defined as beer in an individual container
5 of seven gallons or more. However, the container size
6 requirement does not align with industry practices, and no other
7 alcohol is taxed based on the size of the container from which
8 it is dispensed. Most retailers, restaurants, and bars, as well
9 as many local small brewers, dispense what is commonly referred
10 to as draft beer from kegs smaller than seven gallons. This is
11 due to the restricted space available to restaurants in the
12 State and limited production of small brewers. The purpose of
13 this Act is to amend the definition of "draft beer" to address
14 this discrepancy.
15 SECTION 2. Section 244D-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
16 amended by amending the definition of "draft beer" to read as
17 follows:

5 SECTION 4. This Act shall take effect on January 1, 2026.
