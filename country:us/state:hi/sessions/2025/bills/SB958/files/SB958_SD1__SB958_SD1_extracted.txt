BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that failing cesspools are contaminating the State's groundwater, streams, and coastal ecosystems.  To address this, the legislature has required all cesspools to be upgraded or converted to a wastewater system approved by the director of health or connected to a sewerage system by 2050.
