A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII;
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that detention and
2 retention ponds are meant to hold stormwater. However, while
3 detention and retention ponds help manage stormwater and control
4 flooding, mitigating risk for these systems is critical in
5 minimizing threats to public health and safety. Hawaii's high
6 drowning rate, the second worst in the nation for residents and
7 the highest for visitors, necessitates joining other
8 jurisdictions across the United States in developing retention
9 and detention pond safety programs. The urgency is made even
10 greater by climate change, which has resulted in more frequent
11 and intense rainfall, causing an increased use of retention
12 ponds, which are designed to hold water year-round, and
13 detention ponds, which remain dry until a major rain.
14 The legislature further finds that the Hawai‘i Water Safety
15 Plan, which was published by the Hawaii Water Safety Coalition
16 in 2025, provides several recommendations to reduce drowning by

15 complex while trying to save the life of her childhood friend.
