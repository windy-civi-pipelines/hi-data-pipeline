C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII;
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that Hawaii faces a
2 persistent housing crisis. Demand for housing significantly
3 outpaces supply, particularly in urban areas. Transit-oriented
4 development districts present a critical opportunity for
5 efficient land use by promoting higher-density development near
6 public transit infrastructure, thereby maximizing the value of
7 public investments. Higher residential density in transit-
8 oriented development districts increases public transit
9 ridership, thus reducing dependency on private automobiles and
10 lowering greenhouse gas emissions, which supports the State's
11 climate resilience and sustainability objectives.
12 The legislature established transit-oriented development
13 infrastructure improvement districts to foster community
14 development by strategically investing in infrastructure
15 improvements through Act 184, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022. The
16 legislature found that transit-oriented development promotes
17 development patterns that enhance residents' quality of life;

1 preserve the natural environment; provide a range of housing
2 choices for residents; and encourage walking, biking, and the
3 use of mass transit. Furthermore, the legislature concluded
4 that the State plays an important role in overcoming barriers to
5 transit-oriented development by encouraging needed investments
6 in improving regional infrastructure such as roads, sewers,
7 power, communication, and storm water management systems.
8 The legislature further recognizes that the ready
9 availability of affordable workforce housing near transit hubs
10 reduces transportation costs and improves access to employment,
11 education, and other essential services, especially for low- and
12 moderate-income households, thereby advancing social and
13 economic equity for the people of Hawaii.
14 The underutilization of land in transit-oriented
15 development districts, due partially to restrictive development
16 standards, undermines the economic and environmental benefits of
17 state investments in county-designated transit-oriented
18 development infrastructure improvement districts, contributes to
19 urban sprawl, and increases infrastructure costs and
20 environmental degradation.

1 The legislature finds that numerous jurisdictions,
2 including California, Oregon, and Washington, have adopted
3 minimum density standards for transit-oriented developments,
4 demonstrating the effectiveness of these measures in increasing
5 housing supply while bolstering transit systems. Transit-
6 oriented development infrastructure improvement districts can
7 increase residential density near transit hubs in order to
8 foster vibrant, walkable communities; support local businesses;
9 and generate higher property tax revenues, contributing to
10 Hawaii's fiscal and economic vitality.
11 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
12 (1) Temporarily establish the mixed-income subaccount
13 within the rental housing revolving fund for five
14 years to finance certain projects, including those
15 located in transit-oriented developments;
16 (2) Require the transit-oriented development
17 infrastructure improvement district board to consider
18 the infrastructure needs of transit-supportive density
19 requirements; and
20 (3) Require the strategic plan developed by the Hawaii
21 interagency council for transit-oriented development

C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII;
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that Hawaii faces a
2 persistent housing crisis. Demand for housing significantly
3 outpaces supply, particularly in urban areas. Transit-oriented
4 development districts present a critical opportunity for
5 efficient land use by promoting higher-density development near
6 public transit infrastructure, thereby maximizing the value of
7 public investments. Higher residential density in transit-
8 oriented development districts increases public transit
9 ridership, thus reducing dependency on private automobiles and
10 lowering greenhouse gas emissions, which supports the State's
11 climate resilience and sustainability objectives.
12 The legislature established transit-oriented development
13 infrastructure improvement districts to foster community
14 development by strategically investing in infrastructure
15 improvements through Act 184, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022. The
16 legislature found that transit-oriented development promotes
17 development patterns that enhance residents' quality of life;

1 preserve the natural environment; provide a range of housing
2 choices for residents; and encourage walking, biking, and the
3 use of mass transit. Furthermore, the legislature concluded
4 that the State plays an important role in overcoming barriers to
5 transit-oriented development by encouraging needed investments
6 in improving regional infrastructure such as roads, sewers,
7 power, communication, and storm water management systems.
8 The legislature further recognizes that the ready
9 availability of affordable workforce housing near transit hubs
10 reduces transportation costs and improves access to employment,
11 education, and other essential services, especially for low- and
12 moderate-income households, thereby advancing social and
13 economic equity for the people of Hawaii.
14 The underutilization of land in transit-oriented
15 development districts, due partially to restrictive development
16 standards, undermines the economic and environmental benefits of
17 state investments in county-designated transit-oriented
18 development infrastructure improvement districts, contributes to
19 urban sprawl, and increases infrastructure costs and
20 environmental degradation.

1 The legislature finds that numerous jurisdictions,
2 including California, Oregon, and Washington, have adopted
3 minimum density standards for transit-oriented developments,
4 demonstrating the effectiveness of these measures in increasing
5 housing supply while bolstering transit systems. Transit-
6 oriented development infrastructure improvement districts can
7 increase residential density near transit hubs in order to
8 foster vibrant, walkable communities; support local businesses;
9 and generate higher property tax revenues, contributing to
10 Hawaii's fiscal and economic vitality.
11 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
12 (1) Temporarily establish the mixed-income subaccount
13 within the rental housing revolving fund for five
14 years to finance certain projects, including those
15 located in transit-oriented developments;
16 (2) Require the transit-oriented development
17 infrastructure improvement district board to consider
18 the infrastructure needs of transit-supportive density
19 requirements; and
20 (3) Require the strategic plan developed by the Hawaii

16 refinanced or sold at a later date. The rules may also provide
17 that moneys from the fund shall be leveraged with other
