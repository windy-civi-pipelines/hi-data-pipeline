BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1. The legislature finds that animal overpopulation contributes to animal suffering in Hawaii.  Spaying and neutering pets are proven ways to reduce pet overpopulation and euthanasia rates.  The legislature further finds that the humane reduction of the free-roaming cat population is in the best interest of cats, wildlife, the environment, and humans.  However, the State does not contribute funds to address these issues. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish a spay and neuter special fund to reduce pet overpopulation and the reproduction of free-roaming cats and to establish various revenue and fundraising sources for the special fund. SECTION 2. Chapter 143, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§143-    Spay and neuter special fund.  (a) There is established in the state treasury the spay and neuter special fund, to be administered by the department of budget and finance.   Moneys received by the department of budget and finance from: (1)  State income tax refund designations to the special fund pursuant to section 235-102.5(e); (2)  Revenue generated by the fundraising fees from special number plates pursuant to section 249-  ; and (3)  Legislative appropriations, private gifts or donations, and other sources, shall be deposited into the special fund. All interest earned or accrued on moneys deposited into the special fund shall become part of the special fund. (b)  Moneys in the special fund shall be expended to reduce pet overpopulation and the reproduction of free-roaming cats by providing spaying and neutering surgery and associated veterinary care; provided that the uses and expenditures of moneys in the special fund shall follow the eligibility criteria established by the advisory committee established under subsection (c). (c)   There is established an advisory committee to assist the department of budget and finance in establishing the eligibility criteria and procedures for disbursements from the special fund. The advisory committee shall consist of five members to be selected by the director of finance and shall include the following: (1)   One representative of the department of budget and finance; (2)   One representative of the Hawaii Animal Welfare Association or its successor organization, who shall be invited to participate; (3)   At least one representative of the Hawaii Veterinary Medical Association, who shall be invited to participate; and (4)   At least one member from a Hawaii-based, private, non-profit animal-welfare organization, who shall be invited to participate. The advisory committee shall select a chairperson from among its members.    All members of the advisory committee shall be residents of the State and shall serve three-year terms.    All members shall have an active interest in humanely reducing pet overpopulation and reducing the number of free-roaming cats in the State. (d)   The advisory committee shall submit an annual report to the director of finance, in a form prescribed by the director, that identifies the total amount of funds that were disbursed from the special fund during the previous fiscal year and the amount of funds to be carried over to the next fiscal year.  The advisory committee shall submit the report to the director of finance within ninety days after the close of each fiscal year. (e)  The members of the advisory committee shall serve without pay but shall be reimbursed for their actual and necessary expenses, including travel expenses, incurred in carrying out their duties." SECTION 3. Chapter 249, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§249-    Special number plates; spay and neuter special fund; authorized.  (a)  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the director of finance shall issue to any registered owner of a motor vehicle, who is a resident of the State, upon completed application and payment of the required fees, a special number plate for the registered owner's motor vehicle supporting the spay and neuter special fund.
