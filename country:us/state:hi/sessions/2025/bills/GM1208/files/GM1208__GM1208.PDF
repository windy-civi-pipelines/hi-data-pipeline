A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO SOLICITATION OF FUNDS FROM THE PUBLIC.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII;
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that Act 205, Session
2 Laws of Hawaii 2024 (Act 205), was intended to regulate
3 charitable fundraising platforms to ensure proper and
4 transparent fundraising activities in the State.
5 The legislature further finds that Act 205's well-intended
6 language creates undue burdens on charitable fundraising
7 platforms and, more importantly, potentially hampers and
8 inhibits the ability of charitable organizations to respond to
9 community needs and fundraise, especially in times of emergency.
10 The legislature additionally finds that it would be prudent
11 to amend Act 205 before its scheduled effective date of
12 January 1, 2026, in a manner that would still achieve the
13 important purposes of public protection, donor security, and
14 transparency, but not overburden charitable fundraising
15 platforms, charitable organizations, and the department of the
16 attorney general, which oversees these activities.

This is to inform you that on May 29, 2025, the following bill was signed into law:

A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO SOLICITATION OF FUNDS FROM THE PUBLIC.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII;
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that Act 205, Session
2 Laws of Hawaii 2024 (Act 205), was intended to regulate
3 charitable fundraising platforms to ensure proper and
4 transparent fundraising activities in the State.
5 The legislature further finds that Act 205's well-intended
6 language creates undue burdens on charitable fundraising
7 platforms and, more importantly, potentially hampers and
8 inhibits the ability of charitable organizations to respond to
9 community needs and fundraise, especially in times of emergency.
10 The legislature additionally finds that it would be prudent
11 to amend Act 205 before its scheduled effective date of
12 January 1, 2026, in a manner that would still achieve the
13 important purposes of public protection, donor security, and
14 transparency, but not overburden charitable fundraising
15 platforms, charitable organizations, and the department of the
16 attorney general, which oversees these activities.
