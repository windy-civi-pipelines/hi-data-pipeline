A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO HEALTH CARE.
BE IT ENACTED B¥ THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that Hawaii continues to
2 face a significant health care provider shortage, especially in
3 rural areas and on the neighbor islands. In the past decade,
4 workforce demands have continued to climb as the State struggles
5 to meet the demand for physicians. This demand is particularly
6 acute when it comes to the need for medical specialists on the
7 neighbor islands. The federal government has designated the
8 neighbor islands as medically underserved areas, and many
9 residents are forced to fly to the island of Oahu to obtain
10 appropriate health care.
11 The legislature recognizes that while there is a need for
12 health care providers on all islands, the level of demand in
13 rural areas and neighbor island communities may sometimes
14 challenge a provider's ability to establish and sustain
15 full-time practices. Due to the shortage of full-time
16 specialists on the neighbor islands, some Oahu-based providers
17 schedule rotations to the neighbor islands to coordinate care,

1 address gaps in needed services, and reduce the need for
2 neighbor island residents to travel to receive care.
3 The legislature also recognizes that the impacts of the
4 2023 wildfires on the island of Maui deeply exacerbated the
5 island's physician shortage. Many medical practices were forced
6 to relocate or close, and medical facilities were damaged.
7 These closures place added stress on Maui's health care system
8 and on the State's health care system as a whole. A recent
9 physician workforce report speculated that the physician
10 shortage on the island of Maui is likely worse than the State's
11 latest estimate. The legislature understands that it is
12 critical to maintain a robust and integrated health care system
13 across the State that allows ease of access for all residents.
14 The legislature believes that organized ambulatory health
15 care facilities are one way to ensure access to care for
16 residents in rural areas, neighbor islands, and communities in
17 the State that are still rebuilding. These facilities allow
18 providers from other areas, and across multiple specialties, to
19 provide health care services to medically underserved residents.
20 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to support the
21 provision of care by reducing the administrative burden for

3 SECTION 2. Chapter 323, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
4 amended by adding a new section to part I to be appropriately
5 designated and to read as follows:

12 of less than five hundred thousand.
13 (c) For purposes of this section, "organized ambulatory
14 health care facility" has the same meaning as defined in section
15 323D-2.”
16 SECTION 3. (a) The department of health shall conduct an
17 evaluation of the benefits and impacts of section 323- ,
18 Hawaii Revised Statutes, established by section 2 of this Act,
19 on local health care systems, surgical access, and financial
20 stability. The evaluation shall include but not be limited to
21 assessing access to health care, quality of care, and costs.
