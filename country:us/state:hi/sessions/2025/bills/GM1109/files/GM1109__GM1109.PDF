HB994 HD1 RELATING TO THE OFFENSE OF

THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
A BILL FORAN ACT
RELATING TO THE OFFENSE OF PROMOTING PORNOGRAPHY FOR MINORS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAH:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that the prevention of
2 sexual exploitation and abuse of children is a government
3 objective of paramount importance, and this objective extends to
4 blocking dissemination of pornographic materials to children.
5 To improve the ability to prosecute those who promote
6 pornography for minors, Act 244, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024,
7 specifically allowed the prosecution of the offense of promoting
8 pornography for minors through undercover operations.
9 The legislature further finds that large-scale undercover
10 operations have proven to be an effective tool in reducing and
11 combating offenders who solicit minors to engage in sexual
12 activities on the Internet. Expeditious charging is crucial
13 during these large-scale operations. Main charges brought from
14 these operations, the offenses of electronic enticement of a
15 child under sections 707-756 and 707-757, Hawaii Revised
16 Statutes, and the offense of commercial sexual exploitation of a
17 minor under section 712-1209.1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, can be

1 instituted by written information. Another major charge
2 resulting from undercover operations, the offense of promoting
3 pornography for minors under section 712-1215, Hawaii Revised
4 Statutes, however, is included in the list of offenses that
5 cannot be instituted by written information under section 806-
6 83, Hawaii Revised Statutes.
7 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to enhance the
8 effectiveness of Act 244, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024, by
9 allowing the offense of promoting pornography for minors to be
10 instituted by written information.
11 SECTION 2. Section 806-83, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
12 amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:
13 "(a) Criminal charges may be instituted by written

15 except under:

19 Inspection Act);
