HB1380 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 1380 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to arborists. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that trees are essential for improving soil health and building climate resiliency.  Trees absorb carbon dioxide and supply oxygen, lower air temperatures, provide shade and shelter, stabilize soil, prevent soil erosion, support the capture and conservation of the State's water supply, help remediate pollutants, and cut down on noise pollution by acting as sound barriers.

Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to require the State to ensure that all certified arborists in its employ or under contract adhere to best management practices. SECTION 2. The State and its departments, offices, agencies, and political subdivisions shall require and enforce all certified arborists in its employ, including contractors, to adhere to best management practices in tree management and arboriculture-related care. For the purposes of this section, "best management practices" means the American National Standards Institute A300 Tree Care standards. SECTION 3. This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
