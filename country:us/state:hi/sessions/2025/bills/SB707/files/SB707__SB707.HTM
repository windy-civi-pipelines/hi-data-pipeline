Section 1:
SB707 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 707 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT rELATING TO LAVA ZONE INSURANCE. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that homeowners residing in lava zones 1 and 2 face unique challenges caused by the inherent volcanic hazards associated with their properties.  Based on these challenges, the legislature further finds that it is appropriate to help alleviate some of the financial burden of insurance premiums for these properties through the establishment of a dedicated lava zone insurance fund. The intent of the fund is to subsidize the cost of insurance premiums for properties in lava zones 1 and 2, thereby reducing the disproportionate burden placed upon homeowners because of the geographic location of their properties. The legislature additionally finds that subsidizing the cost of insurance premiums for properties in these zones will promote fairness, affordability, and accessibility in the insurance market, encouraging homeownership and community resilience in these unique geographical areas. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to ensure that people are not forced to lose their homes over a sudden rise in homeowners' insurance by establishing a fair and equitable resource to subsidize property insurance for homeowners residing in lava zones 1 and 2. SECTION 2.  Chapter 431, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to article 10E to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§431:10E- Lava zone insurance fund.  (a) There is established a lava zone insurance fund into which shall be deposited the following moneys: (1)  Appropriations by the legislature to the special fund; (2)  Gifts, donations, and grants from public agencies and private persons; (3)  Any proceeds collected by the department derived from fees charged to carry out the purposes of this section; and (4)  Civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, fines, and other charges, if any, collected under this chapter or any rule adopted pursuant to this chapter. (b) All interest earned or accrued on moneys deposited in the fund shall become part of the fund. (c) Moneys in the fund shall be expended by the commissioner to subsidize the cost of insurance premiums for homeowners in properties in lava zones 1 and 2; provided that: (1)  A homeowner does not own a real estate investment property; (2)  The homeowner is a part of a low-income household as determined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development; and (3)  No more than per cent of the moneys may be used to cover administrative and operational costs of the lava zone subsidy program. (d)  The subsidy amount for each homeowner shall not be more than $ and for a period of      years. (e) Moneys deposited in the fund shall not revert to the general fund. (f) The department shall adopt rules in accordance with chapter 91 for the purposes of this section, including the establishment of any fees, penalties, fines, and other charges that may be needed to implement the lava zone subsidy program."
