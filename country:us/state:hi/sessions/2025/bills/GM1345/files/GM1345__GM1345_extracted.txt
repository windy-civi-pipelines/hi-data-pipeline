Pursuant to the notice requirement of Section 16 of Article III of the Constitution of the

items stricken or reduced and my official statement of objections to the specific items

H.B. 300 RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS TO HOUSE BILL NO. 300
Honorable Members
Thirty-Third Legislature
State of Hawai'i
Pursuant to Section 16 of Article III of the Constitution of the State of
Hawai'i, I am returning herewith, without my approval. House Bill No. 300, entitled "A Bill
for an Act Relating to the State Budget."
The purpose of this bill, the General Appropriations Act of 2025, is to
appropriate funds for the fiscal biennium 2025-2027 to fund the operations and capital
improvement projects of the Executive Branch agencies and programs.
While the bill as a whole has merit, the use of general fund moneys must
be reprioritized due to: (1) the change in the Council on Revenues' general fund tax
revenue projection in May 2025, which necessitates that the State's financial plan be
rebalanced through line-item vetoes and reductions to the budget, and (2) the need to
maintain flexibility to plan for the possibility of federal government cutbacks.
Because of the need to reprioritize the use of general fund moneys, the
general fund appropriations were subject to; (1) an assessment of new programs or
programs in which future recurring funds would be needed that were not currently
budgeted, (2) an evaluation of each expending agency's ability and capacity to spend
down the moneys efficiently within the authorized appropriation period, (3) an
assessment of the availability of other funds that could support program or project
goals, and (4) a determination of whether such an appropriation could be revisited at a
later date, when more information about the federal funding changes is available.

Section 2:
Section 16 of Article III of the Constitution of the State of Hawai'i provides
that, "[ejxcept for items appropriated to be expended by the judicial and legislative
branches, the governor may veto any specific item or items in any bill which
appropriates money for specific purposes by striking out or reducing the same."
STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS
HOUSE BILL NO. 300
Page 2
Consequently, I object to the expenditure of some of the appropriations in this bill, for
the reasons indicated.
Of the general fund program appropriations set forth in section 3 of this
bill, I object to the following items because of the lower revenues projected by the
Council on Revenues and the need to maintain flexibility to plan for the possibility of
federal government cutbacks.
Specific Items Vetoed
Because of the foregoing objections, I have taken the following actions on
specific appropriation items set forth in section 3 at the stated page and line numbers of
this bill, pursuant to my appropriation line-item veto authority, as follows;

items stricken or reduced and my official statement of objections to the specific items
contained in the bill:
H.B. 300 RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET.

EXECUTIVE CHAMBERS
HONOLULU
June 27. 2025
STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS TO HOUSE BILL NO. 300
Honorable Members
Thirty-Third Legislature
State of Hawai'i
Pursuant to Section 16 of Article III of the Constitution of the State of
Hawai'i, I am returning herewith, without my approval. House Bill No. 300, entitled "A Bill
for an Act Relating to the State Budget."
The purpose of this bill, the General Appropriations Act of 2025, is to
appropriate funds for the fiscal biennium 2025-2027 to fund the operations and capital
improvement projects of the Executive Branch agencies and programs.
While the bill as a whole has merit, the use of general fund moneys must
be reprioritized due to: (1) the change in the Council on Revenues' general fund tax
revenue projection in May 2025, which necessitates that the State's financial plan be
rebalanced through line-item vetoes and reductions to the budget, and (2) the need to
maintain flexibility to plan for the possibility of federal government cutbacks.
Because of the need to reprioritize the use of general fund moneys, the
general fund appropriations were subject to; (1) an assessment of new programs or
programs in which future recurring funds would be needed that were not currently
budgeted, (2) an evaluation of each expending agency's ability and capacity to spend
down the moneys efficiently within the authorized appropriation period, (3) an
assessment of the availability of other funds that could support program or project
goals, and (4) a determination of whether such an appropriation could be revisited at a
later date, when more information about the federal funding changes is available.
Section 16 of Article III of the Constitution of the State of Hawai'i provides
that, "[ejxcept for items appropriated to be expended by the judicial and legislative
branches, the governor may veto any specific item or items in any bill which
appropriates money for specific purposes by striking out or reducing the same."

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS
HOUSE BILL NO. 300
Page 2
Consequently, I object to the expenditure of some of the appropriations in this bill, for
the reasons indicated.
Of the general fund program appropriations set forth in section 3 of this
bill, I object to the following items because of the lower revenues projected by the
Council on Revenues and the need to maintain flexibility to plan for the possibility of
federal government cutbacks.
Specific Items Vetoed
Because of the foregoing objections, I have taken the following actions on
specific appropriation items set forth in section 3 at the stated page and line numbers of
this bill, pursuant to my appropriation line-item veto authority, as follows;

general funds, and changed it to $378,937,360.
4. For item G-17, UCHI00 - University of Hawaii, Manoa, on page 34,
line 38, reduced by $785,000 of the total $290,419,091 appropriation for fiscal year
2025-2026 funded by general funds, and changed it to $289,634,091.
5. For item 1-16, LAW504 - Criminal Investigation Division, on page

47, line 30, reduced by $600,000 of the total $51,336,206 appropriation for fiscal year
