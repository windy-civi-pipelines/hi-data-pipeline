SB1316 HD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1316 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII H.D. 1 A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO COURT-ORDERED PAYMENTS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  Section 601-17.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§601-17.5  Collection of delinquent court-ordered payments.  The judiciary [may] shall contract with a collection agency bonded under chapter 443B or with a licensed attorney to collect any delinquent court-ordered [penalties,] fees, fines, [restitution,] sanctions, and court costs[, including juvenile monetary assessments].  Any fees or costs associated with the collection efforts shall be added to the amount due and retained by the collection agency as its payment; provided that no fees or costs shall exceed fifty per cent of the amount collected." SECTION 2.  Section 706-642, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§706-642  Time and method of payment.  (1)  When a defendant is sentenced to pay a fee, fine, or restitution, the court may grant permission for the payment to be made within a specified period of time or in specified installments.  If no such permission is embodied in the sentence, the fee, fine, or restitution shall be payable forthwith by cash, check, or [by] a credit card approved by the court. (2)  When a defendant sentenced to pay a fee, fine, or restitution is also sentenced to probation, the court may make the payment of the fee, fine, or restitution a condition of probation. (3)  When a defendant sentenced to pay a fee or fine is also ordered to make restitution or reparation to the victim or victims, or to the person or party who has incurred loss or damage because of the defendant's crime, the payment of restitution or reparation shall have priority over the payment of the fee or fine, pursuant to section 706-651.  No fee or fine shall be collected until the restitution or reparation order has been satisfied." SECTION 3.  Section 706-644, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§706-644  Consequences of nonpayment; imprisonment for contumacious nonpayment; summary collection.  (1)  When a defendant in district court is sentenced pursuant to section 706-605, granted a conditional discharge pursuant to section 712-1255, or granted a deferred plea pursuant to chapter 853, and the defendant is ordered to pay a fee, fine, or restitution, whether as an independent order, as part of a judgment and sentence, or as a condition of probation or deferred plea[, and]: (a)  If the defendant was ordered to pay restitution, the court shall set a proof of compliance hearing for the defendant; provided that the court may further order that the defendant need not appear for the proof of compliance hearing if all fees, fines, and restitution have been paid in full and all other sentencing requirements have been met before a designated date, which may be earlier than the proof of compliance date.  At each proof of compliance hearing for a defendant in district court, if the defendant appears and is in compliance, but has not yet paid all fees, fines, and restitution in full, the court shall order a further proof of compliance hearing within one year or as soon as practicable until the fees, fines, or restitution have been paid in full.  If the defendant defaults in the payment thereof [or of any installment], the court[, upon the motion of the prosecuting attorney or upon its own motion, may] shall require the defendant to show cause why the defendant's default should not be treated as contumacious, and [may], if the defendant fails to appear, the court shall issue a summons or a warrant of arrest for the defendant's appearance.  Unless the defendant shows that the defendant's default was not attributable to an intentional refusal to obey the order of the court, or to a failure on the defendant's part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for the payment, the court shall find that the defendant's default was contumacious and may order the defendant committed until the fee, fine, restitution, or a specified part thereof is paid[.]; provided that for a defendant in district court, if the fees, fines, and restitution are not paid in full, the court shall order further proof of compliance hearings every six months or less until the court is satisfied that the defendant will appear and remain in compliance; or (b)  If the defendant was ordered to pay fines, fees, or both, but no restitution, the district court shall refer the outstanding fines or fees to the collection agency contracted pursuant to section 601-17.5. A proof of compliance hearing shall not be required in cases where no restitution was ordered. (2)  When a fee, fine, or restitution is imposed on a corporation or unincorporated association, it [is] shall be the duty of the person or persons authorized to make disbursement from the assets of the corporation or association to pay it from those assets, and their failure to do so may be held contumacious unless they make the showing required in subsection (1). (3)  The term of imprisonment for nonpayment of fee, fine, or restitution shall be specified in the order of commitment, and shall not exceed one day for each $250 of the fee or fine, thirty days if the fee or fine was imposed upon conviction of a violation or a petty misdemeanor, or one year in any other case, whichever is the shorter period.  A person committed for nonpayment of a fee or fine shall be given credit toward payment of the fee or fine for each day of imprisonment, at the rate of $250 per day. (4)  If it appears that the defendant's default in the payment of a fee, fine, or restitution is not contumacious, the court may make an order allowing the defendant additional time for payment, reducing the amount of each installment, or revoking the fee, fine, or the unpaid portion thereof in whole or in part, or converting the unpaid portion of the fee or fine to community service.  A defendant shall not be discharged from an order to pay restitution until the full amount of the restitution has actually been collected or accounted for. (5)  Unless discharged by payment or, in the case of a fee or fine, service of imprisonment pursuant to subsection (3), an order to pay a fee, fine, or restitution, whether as an independent order, as a part of a judgment and sentence, or as a condition of probation or deferred plea pursuant to chapter 853, may be collected in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action.  The State or the victim named in the order may collect the restitution, including costs, interest, and attorney's fees, pursuant to section 706-646.  The State may collect the fee or fine, including costs, interest, and attorney's fees, pursuant to section 706-647. (6)  Attorney's fees, costs, and interest shall not be deemed part of the penalty, and no person shall be imprisoned under this section in default of payment of attorney's fees, costs, and interest. (7)  For purposes of this section, "default" means failure to pay a fee, fine, or restitution within a period of time specified by the court pursuant to section 706-642, or failure to pay three consecutive installments of a fee, fine, or restitution, whichever occurs first." SECTION 4.  Section 806-73, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows: "(b) All adult probation records shall be confidential and shall not be deemed to be public records.  As used in this section, [the term] "records" includes but is not limited to all records made by any adult probation officer in the course of performing the probation officer's official duties.  The records, or the content of the records, shall be divulged only as follows: (1)  A copy of any adult probation case record or of a portion of it, or the case record itself, upon request, may be provided to: (A)  An adult probation officer, a court officer, a social worker of a Hawaii state adult probation unit, or a family court officer who is preparing a report for the courts;
