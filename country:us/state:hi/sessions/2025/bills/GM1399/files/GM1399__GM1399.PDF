STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS TO HOUSE BILL NO. 235
Honorable Members
Thirty-Third Legislature
State of Hawai'i
Pursuant to Section 16 of Article III of the Constitution of the State of
Hawaii, I am returning herewith, without my approval. House Bill No. 235, entitled "A Bill
for an Act Relating to Traffic Safety."
The purpose of this bill is to improve traffic and pedestrian safety along the
North Shore of Oahu. To achieve this, the bill requires the Department of
Transportation to expand the use of photo red light imaging detector systems and
automated speed enforcement systems to locations on the North Shore, following public
education efforts by the City and County of Honolulu about the traffic enforcement
systems.
This bill is objectionable because by selecting unidentified locations on the
North Shore of Oahu for expansion of the use of photo red light imaging detector
systems and automated speed enforcement systems, the bill ignores that the
Department of Transportation (DOT) has established a statewide methodology for
selecting the communities and expansion areas within which to implement these types
of traffic safety systems. The criteria in the DOT'S methodology include the number of
crashes caused by drivers who disregarded traffic signals, volume of traffic, and traffic
citations for disregarding signals. The DOT stresses the importance of consistency
when selecting a location for implementation of the traffic safety systems. DOT'S
methodology ensures communities are chosen based on need and potential for greatest
impact. Disregarding the DOT'S criteria for location selection threatens the integrity of
the photo red light imaging detector system and automated speed enforcement system
programs.

6 finds that the use of photo red light imaging detector systems
7 and automated speed enforcement systems has demonstrated success
8 in improving safety outcomes. Additionally, the safe routes to
9 school advisory committee plays a key role in addressing school-
10 adjacent infrastructure needs to protect keiki and their
11 families.

13 and pedestrian safety along the North Shore of Oahu by:

12 (b) Before expanding the use of photo red light imaging

16 adjust any systems necessary to carry out the purposes of this
17 Act.
