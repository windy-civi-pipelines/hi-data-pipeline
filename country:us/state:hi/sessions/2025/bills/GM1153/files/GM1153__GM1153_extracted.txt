STATE OF HAWAII ' * H.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO COMMUNITY OUTREACH BOARDS,
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAH:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that county neighborhood
2 and advisory boards provide local communities with opportunities
3 to participate in government. Likewise, boards created for the
4 purpose of community outreach, such as the Hawaii county
5 community development plan action committees, serve as an
6 intermediary between residents and government leaders to
7 understand local concerns, gather and disseminate information,
8 and create solutions in a collaborative environment. However,
9 because such boards are not specific to one neighborhood, it is
10 not clear that they are "neighborhood boards" and thus entitled
11 to use the special provisions set out for neighborhood boards in
12 part VII of chapter 92, Hawaii Revised Statutes. As community
13 outreach boards serve as a grassroots tool, ensuring open access
14 to board activities is essential to thriving communities
15 statewide.
16 Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to:
17 (1) Define "community outreach board";

5 board members to attend meetings or presentations
6 related to official board business statewide.
7 SECTION 2. Chapter 92, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended
8 by adding a new section to part VII to be appropriately
9 designated and to read as follows:
10 "§92- Definition. As used in this part, "community
11 outreach board" means a board established to serve in a
12 community advisory capacity under a county commission or a
13 county department."

14 a duly noticed meeting, a board may take action on an
15 unanticipated event in the public interest that is not on the
16 agenda in the same manner as if the board had held an emergency
17 meeting to take action on the issue, pursuant to section 92-8."
