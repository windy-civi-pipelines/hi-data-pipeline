This is to inform you that on July 1, 2025, the following bill was signed into law:
H.B. NO. 430, H.D. 2, RELATING TO INTERNSHIPS.

THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO INTERNSHIPS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION I. The legislature finds that internship and
2 mentorship programs give students the chance to build
3 communication skills, relationships, confidence, and gain
4 valuable work experience that will build a stronger workforce.
5 The legislature further finds that expanding state-funded
6 internships to include private-sector positions will benefit the
7 State by promoting economic growth, fostering public-private
8 collaborations, and supporting job creation. State-funded
9 private-sector internships will also create additional
10 opportunities for interns to gain practical work experience and
11 prepare for their future careers.
12 The legislature recognizes that article VII, section 4, of
13 the Hawaii State Constitution requires the legislature to
14 appropriate moneys "for a public purpose". The courts have
15 found that what constitutes a public purpose "is generally a
16 question for the legislature to decide" and that the legislature

C.D. 1
1 should be given "wide discretion" in this matter (State ex. rel.
2 Amemiya v. Anderson, 56 Haw. 566, 574 (1976)).
3 The legislature believes that permitting state-funded
4 private sector internships is in the best interests of the
5 State, and serves a public purpose of supporting health, safety,
6 and welfare.
7 The legislature further recognizes that the department of
8 labor and industrial relation's Hele Imua internship program
9 connects public high school students and graduates with
10 structured, worlc-based learning opportunities in high-demand
11 career fields, including education, health, and building and
12 construction. The program gives students the chance to
13 experience public sector jobs. The Hele Imua internship program
14 also helps create a pipeline to fill vacancies in state and
15 county governments, gives interns the opportunity to gain on-
16 the-job experience, prepares interns for possible careers in
17 jobs that are in high demand, and helps to develop relationships
18 between students and recent graduates with potential employers.
19 The legislature believes that a similar program to the Hele Imua
20 program that connects students and recent graduates with private
21 sector employers who commit to cost-sharing in the program will

1 help address the projected shortage of positions in the State's
2 building and construction industry.
3 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
4 (1) Authorize the department of labor and industrial
5 relations to administer an on-the-job training work,
6 experience program for eligible interns that partners
7 with private entities to increase opportunities for
8 high school and college and university students to
9 participate in summer internship programs and allow
10 internships with private sector employers through a
11 cost-sharing strategy;
12 (2) Establish a state-funded internship program within the
13 department of labor and industrial relations, in
14 collaboration with department of human resources
15 development, to place interns in state executive
16 branch departments, agencies, or programs to provide
17 participants with practical work experience and foster
18 interest in public service careers; and
19 (3) Appropriate funds to the department of education to
20 support the internship programs pursuant to this Act.

THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO INTERNSHIPS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION I. The legislature finds that internship and
2 mentorship programs give students the chance to build
3 communication skills, relationships, confidence, and gain
4 valuable work experience that will build a stronger workforce.
5 The legislature further finds that expanding state-funded
6 internships to include private-sector positions will benefit the
7 State by promoting economic growth, fostering public-private
8 collaborations, and supporting job creation. State-funded
9 private-sector internships will also create additional
10 opportunities for interns to gain practical work experience and
11 prepare for their future careers.
12 The legislature recognizes that article VII, section 4, of
13 the Hawaii State Constitution requires the legislature to
14 appropriate moneys "for a public purpose". The courts have
15 found that what constitutes a public purpose "is generally a
16 question for the legislature to decide" and that the legislature

1 should be given "wide discretion" in this matter (State ex. rel.
2 Amemiya v. Anderson, 56 Haw. 566, 574 (1976)).
3 The legislature believes that permitting state-funded
4 private sector internships is in the best interests of the
5 State, and serves a public purpose of supporting health, safety,
6 and welfare.
7 The legislature further recognizes that the department of
8 labor and industrial relation's Hele Imua internship program
9 connects public high school students and graduates with
10 structured, worlc-based learning opportunities in high-demand
11 career fields, including education, health, and building and
12 construction. The program gives students the chance to
13 experience public sector jobs. The Hele Imua internship program
14 also helps create a pipeline to fill vacancies in state and
15 county governments, gives interns the opportunity to gain on-
16 the-job experience, prepares interns for possible careers in
17 jobs that are in high demand, and helps to develop relationships
18 between students and recent graduates with potential employers.
19 The legislature believes that a similar program to the Hele Imua
20 program that connects students and recent graduates with private
21 sector employers who commit to cost-sharing in the program will

1 help address the projected shortage of positions in the State's
2 building and construction industry.
3 Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:
4 (1) Authorize the department of labor and industrial
5 relations to administer an on-the-job training work,
6 experience program for eligible interns that partners
7 with private entities to increase opportunities for
8 high school and college and university students to
9 participate in summer internship programs and allow
10 internships with private sector employers through a
11 cost-sharing strategy;
12 (2) Establish a state-funded internship program within the
13 department of labor and industrial relations, in
14 collaboration with department of human resources
15 development, to place interns in state executive
16 branch departments, agencies, or programs to provide
17 participants with practical work experience and foster
18 interest in public service careers; and
19 (3) Appropriate funds to the department of education to
20 support the internship programs pursuant to this Act.
