The contract amount awarded, however, shall be the amount of the price offered, exclusive of the preference. (b)  For purposes of subsection (a), in determining whether there is conformance with chapter 372, the procurement officer shall consider the actual number of apprentices enrolled in and the annual number of graduates of the apprenticeship program.

This subsection shall be deemed to be incorporated into a public works contract.  A bidder who is awarded a contract shall be subject to the following sanctions if, after commencement of work, the bidder at any time during the construction is no longer a party to a registered apprenticeship agreement for each apprenticeable trade the bidder will employ to construct the public works: (1)  Temporary or permanent cessation of work on the project, without recourse to breach of contract claims by the bidder; provided that the governmental body shall be entitled to restitution for nonperformance or liquidated damages, as appropriate; or (2)  Proceedings to debar or suspend under section 103D‑702. (d)  For purposes of this section, "bidder" means an entity that submits a competitive sealed bid under section 103D-302 or submits a competitive sealed proposal under section 103D-303."
