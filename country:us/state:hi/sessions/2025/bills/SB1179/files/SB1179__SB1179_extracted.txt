SB1179 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1179 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to health care. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the delivery of health care services in the State has approached crisis levels.  Many physicians and other health care providers are leaving Hawaii, and the level of health care services on the neighbor islands in particular is seriously deficient. The legislature further finds that, even with the 1974 Hawaii Prepaid Health Care Act that mandates employers provide health insurance for employees working at least nineteen hours per week, and even with the extensions of medicaid to larger populations in the State and the increase of commercial health insurance coverage created by the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), there remain a substantial number of uninsured or underinsured individuals.  Additionally, the linkage of health insurance to employment status, which many years ago was an employment benefit, has now become a serious impediment to employee mobility.  A substantial number of people feel financially compelled to remain in unsatisfactory employment situations to protect their access to health insurance and therefore to health care. The legislature finds that it is in the best interest of the State for each and every state citizen to have publicly provided, high quality, affordable health care.  Health care is more than just medical insurance payouts.  It includes cost-saving, preventive, and early intervention measures to prevent medical conditions from becoming chronic, permanently disabling, or fatal and includes proven secondary and tertiary prevention strategies and interventions to maintain the health and quality of life of those who are burdened with serious chronic diseases. The legislature additionally finds that Hawaii's current health care insurance system is a disjointed, costly, inefficient, and unnecessarily complicated, multi-payer, private medical insurance model that is largely profit-driven, adversarial, beset with constant cost-shifting and reluctant health care delivery, onerously bureaucratic, and economically irrational.  Additionally, health care costs are skyrocketing, creating an affordability and accessibility crisis for Hawaii's residents.  The three largest cost-drivers of health care in the United States in general and in Hawaii in particular are: (1)  The administrative cost of a profit-driven complex of payment-reluctant, multi-payer health insurance bureaucracies competing to insure the healthy, while leaving those who need health care the most to the taxpayers, or competing to siphon money out of the state medicaid budget while beneficiary access to care deteriorates and costs rise; (2)  Lack of access to cost-effective primary care for large segments of the population; and (3)  The high cost of prescription drugs. The legislature further finds that for more than a quarter of a century, Hawaii was far ahead of most other states and often called itself "the health state" because of the 1974 Hawaii Prepaid Health Care Act.  Hawaii was once known for having a low uninsured population of between two and five per cent in 1994.  Hawaii had the lowest per-capita medicare spending in the country in 2008-2009, prior to the PPACA when almost all Hawaii providers of care were paid with fee-for-service.  Ten years later Hawaii had climbed to ninth lowest per-capita medicare spending and rising. However, the crisis in health care in the United States has also befallen Hawaii. Today, thousands of Hawaii citizens lack health care coverage, many of whom are children.  Many other Hawaii residents are underinsured or unable to use or access their covered benefits because of increasingly expensive deductibles and out-of-pocket co-payments for outpatient visits, diagnostic tests, and prescription drugs, among other factors.  Even well-insured individuals experience problems with their insurers denying, or very reluctantly dispensing, expensive medicines and treatments. About half of all bankruptcies are due to extremely expensive, catastrophic illnesses that are not covered after a certain cap is reached.  Other persons are near bankruptcy with their quality of life seriously impacted.  And even with health insurance, Hawaii residents are experiencing increasing difficulty finding doctors when they need them on all islands, but especially on the neighbor islands. The legislature therefore concludes that a universal, publicly administered, health care-for-all insurance model with one payout agency for caregivers and providers, adapted to meet the unique conditions in Hawaii, would be beneficial across all sectors in the State.  A single payer system would remove health care as a factor in labor negotiations; reduce overall costs and generate savings for patients; streamline processes for health care providers; reduce overhead expenses for businesses; create a single, centralized health information database for all residents in Hawaii, allowing for more informed decision making regarding health crises in the State; create an equitable allocation of public health resources and provide for a needs-based expansion of health care facilities; reduce billing and collections costs for hospitals and independent health care providers; and eliminate profit-based decision making in the provision of health care services. Accordingly, the legislature concludes that Hawaii should take substantial steps toward the establishment of universal health care for the residents of the State and to encourage, as much as practical, reduction of administrative complexity in the compensation of the State's hospitals and other institutional providers of care, and of physicians and other workers in the health care field. This should be accomplished by the creation of a publicly financed health care program, to be known as "malama care", for all Hawaii residents and which shall replace all existing health care systems in the State once the appropriate federal waivers are obtained, including medicare, Medicaid, and the prepaid health care act. The purpose of this Act is to initiate the implementation of malama care by: (1)  Requiring the Hawaii health authority to develop a universal, single payer health care plan to be implemented as malama care; (2)  Establishing malama care; and (3)  Appropriating funds. PART II SECTION 2.  Chapter 322H, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part    .  Malama care §322H-A  Definitions.  For the purposes of this part: "Malama care" means a universal, single payer health care system to provide comprehensive health care benefits to all residents of the State.
