Section 1:
SB719 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 719 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to sugar-sweetened beverages. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that there is a need to continue to invest in the health of Hawaii's keiki and ohana.  Sugar-sweetened beverages are the largest source of excess sugar in the American diet, contributing excess calories with little or no nutritional value.  Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption is associated with negative health effects such as obesity, which amounts to an estimated $470,000,000 annually in obesity-related health care costs statewide. The consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is also linked to other serious health problems, including weight gain, prediabetes, diabetes, tooth decay, heart disease, and other health conditions.  Statewide, one out of four middle and high school students, and more than half of all adults, are overweight or obese.  Sixty-one per cent of adults in Hawaii are living with at least one chronic disease such as diabetes, heart disease, or cancer.  A 2016 report found that the State has the highest prevalence of tooth decay among third graders in the nation, as seventy-one per cent of third graders were affected by tooth decay.  The State also received a failing grade in a series of oral health report cards released by the Pew Center on the States. The legislature also finds that a fee on sugar-sweetened beverages is a viable method to reduce sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, improve health, and generate revenue for the State to support public health, prevent chronic disease, and address root causes of disparities in Hawaii.  A 2017 study conducted by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the department of health found that a sugar-sweetened drink fee has the potential for major cost-savings.  Passage of a two-cent-per-ounce sugar-sweetened beverage fee is projected to result in lower levels of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, fewer cases of obesity, fewer deaths, and health care savings greater than $59,000,000 over a ten-year period.  According to the Rudd Center Revenue Calculator for Sugary Drink Taxes, a two-cent-per-ounce fee would have raised as much as $65,800,000 in 2020. The legislature also finds that sugar-sweetened beverage consumption is a health equity issue, as rates of consumption are greatest among individuals with lower incomes and people of color, due in part to issues surrounding a lack of access to healthy foods and the targeted marketing by the sugar-sweetened beverage industry.  Lower-income populations and people of color also have higher rates of chronic disease due to other social determinants of health, including food and housing insecurity, lack of access to health care, and lack of spaces for safe physical activity. The COVID-19 pandemic has drawn attention to these health and social inequities in the State.  COVID-19 has most severely impacted the Pacific Islander, Filipino, and Native Hawaiian populations, who have the highest rates of chronic disease and sugar-sweetened drink consumption. Additionally, regulations to mitigate the spread of COVID‑19 have created economic hardships for the people of Hawaii, especially for these vulnerable populations.  An opportunity exists to implement a sugar-sweetened beverage fee to discourage sugary drink consumption and to help reduce chronic disease risks, significantly save on health care costs, and generate revenue that can be used to minimize health disparities and support health promotion programs during projected post-COVID-19 challenges. Over the last several years, sugar-sweetened beverage tax policies have been enacted in several cities throughout the United States and dozens of countries globally.  Sugar-sweetened beverage tax policies involve the collection of a tax or fee from sugar-sweetened beverage distributors that is passed on to consumers in the form of price increases that influence purchasing behavior.  Jurisdictions with sugar-sweetened beverage taxes such as Berkeley, California, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, have seen a reduction in sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, while sales of bottled water and other healthier options increased.  Further evaluation results from these jurisdictions show that overall sales and revenue were not harmed by a fee at the distributor level.  A sugar-sweetened beverage fee has instead provided a source of revenue that has generated millions of dollars to aid in reducing health and socioeconomic disparities.  Recently, some of these locations reallocated their funding to specifically address critical needs resulting from COVID-19, such as assisting low-income families facing food insecurity. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to enact a fee on sugar-sweetened beverages in Hawaiʻi to improve the health of its residents and generate revenues for the State to support health, prevent chronic disease, and address root causes of health disparities in Hawaii.  This Act shall be known and cited as the Healthy Ohana Act of 2025.

SB719 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 719 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to sugar-sweetened beverages. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that there is a need to continue to invest in the health of Hawaii's keiki and ohana.  Sugar-sweetened beverages are the largest source of excess sugar in the American diet, contributing excess calories with little or no nutritional value.  Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption is associated with negative health effects such as obesity, which amounts to an estimated $470,000,000 annually in obesity-related health care costs statewide. The consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is also linked to other serious health problems, including weight gain, prediabetes, diabetes, tooth decay, heart disease, and other health conditions.  Statewide, one out of four middle and high school students, and more than half of all adults, are overweight or obese.  Sixty-one per cent of adults in Hawaii are living with at least one chronic disease such as diabetes, heart disease, or cancer.  A 2016 report found that the State has the highest prevalence of tooth decay among third graders in the nation, as seventy-one per cent of third graders were affected by tooth decay.  The State also received a failing grade in a series of oral health report cards released by the Pew Center on the States. The legislature also finds that a fee on sugar-sweetened beverages is a viable method to reduce sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, improve health, and generate revenue for the State to support public health, prevent chronic disease, and address root causes of disparities in Hawaii.  A 2017 study conducted by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the department of health found that a sugar-sweetened drink fee has the potential for major cost-savings.  Passage of a two-cent-per-ounce sugar-sweetened beverage fee is projected to result in lower levels of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, fewer cases of obesity, fewer deaths, and health care savings greater than $59,000,000 over a ten-year period.  According to the Rudd Center Revenue Calculator for Sugary Drink Taxes, a two-cent-per-ounce fee would have raised as much as $65,800,000 in 2020. The legislature also finds that sugar-sweetened beverage consumption is a health equity issue, as rates of consumption are greatest among individuals with lower incomes and people of color, due in part to issues surrounding a lack of access to healthy foods and the targeted marketing by the sugar-sweetened beverage industry.  Lower-income populations and people of color also have higher rates of chronic disease due to other social determinants of health, including food and housing insecurity, lack of access to health care, and lack of spaces for safe physical activity. The COVID-19 pandemic has drawn attention to these health and social inequities in the State.  COVID-19 has most severely impacted the Pacific Islander, Filipino, and Native Hawaiian populations, who have the highest rates of chronic disease and sugar-sweetened drink consumption. Additionally, regulations to mitigate the spread of COVID‑19 have created economic hardships for the people of Hawaii, especially for these vulnerable populations.  An opportunity exists to implement a sugar-sweetened beverage fee to discourage sugary drink consumption and to help reduce chronic disease risks, significantly save on health care costs, and generate revenue that can be used to minimize health disparities and support health promotion programs during projected post-COVID-19 challenges. Over the last several years, sugar-sweetened beverage tax policies have been enacted in several cities throughout the United States and dozens of countries globally.  Sugar-sweetened beverage tax policies involve the collection of a tax or fee from sugar-sweetened beverage distributors that is passed on to consumers in the form of price increases that influence purchasing behavior.  Jurisdictions with sugar-sweetened beverage taxes such as Berkeley, California, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, have seen a reduction in sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, while sales of bottled water and other healthier options increased.  Further evaluation results from these jurisdictions show that overall sales and revenue were not harmed by a fee at the distributor level.  A sugar-sweetened beverage fee has instead provided a source of revenue that has generated millions of dollars to aid in reducing health and socioeconomic disparities.  Recently, some of these locations reallocated their funding to specifically address critical needs resulting from COVID-19, such as assisting low-income families facing food insecurity. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to enact a fee on sugar-sweetened beverages in Hawaiʻi to improve the health of its residents and generate revenues for the State to support health, prevent chronic disease, and address root causes of health disparities in Hawaii.  This Act shall be known and cited as the Healthy Ohana Act of 2025. SECTION 2. Chapter 321, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "PART     .  SUGAR-SWEETENED BEVERAGE FEE PROGRAM §321-A   Definitions.  As used in this part: "Auditor" means the office of the auditor.
