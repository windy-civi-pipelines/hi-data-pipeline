"Distribute" does not include any alteration of a deepfake, including altering the length of the recording, so long as the alteration does not knowingly remove any content, context, or clear disclosure visible throughout the duration of the recording that would cause a reasonable person to believe that the audio or visual media is not a record of a real event. "Sexual conduct" means actual or simulated sexual intercourse, including genital-genital contact, oral-genital contact, anal-genital contact, or oral-anal contact, whether between persons of the same or opposite sex, masturbation, bestiality, sexual penetration, deviant sexual intercourse, sadomasochistic abuse, or lascivious exhibition of the genital or pubic area."
