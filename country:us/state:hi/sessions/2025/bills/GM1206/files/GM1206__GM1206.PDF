THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025
STATE OF HAWAII
C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO HARM REDUCTION.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII;
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that sharing injection
2 equipment among individuals who use drugs significantly
3 contributes to the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
4 hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and other serious bloodborne
5 infections. Act 152, Session Laws of Hawaii 1992, authorized
6 the establishment of the first state-funded sterile needle and
7 syringe exchange program in the United States. The program aims
8 to prevent the transmission of bloodborne pathogens and to
9 provide individuals who inject drugs with services such as
10 referrals to appropriate health and social services, thereby
11 reducing the overall disease burden in Hawaii.
12 Over the past thirty years, extensive scientific research
13 has confirmed that syringe exchange programs nationwide
14 effectively reduce disease transmission, increase access to
15 addiction treatment, improve public safety, lower health care
16 costs, and do not lead to an increase in drug use or crime.
17 Research has also helped identify the most effective approaches

1 in what are now commonly referred to as "syringe services
2 programs".
3 A 2020 report by the Centers for Disease Control and
4 Prevention, United States Department of Health and Human
5 Services, concluded that syringe programs that restrict syringe
6 distribution to one-to-one exchange are less effective than
7 needs-based distribution programs that provide sterile needles
8 and syringes to syringe exchange participants in quantities
9 sufficient to reduce the likelihood of needles and syringes
10 being shared or reused. The Centers for Disease Control and
11 Prevention supports needs-based approaches to syringe
12 distribution based on evidence that it is the best practice for
13 reducing new HIV and viral hepatitis infections. The Centers
14 for Disease Control and Prevention concludes that, compared to
15 one-to-one exchanges, needs-based syringe distribution leads to
16 less syringe sharing and reuse, lowers risk of infection, and is
17 not associated with increased unsafe syringe disposal. Research
18 shows that syringe distribution programs are safe, effective,
19 cost-saving, do not increase drug use or crime, and do not cause
20 people to begin injecting drugs. However, Hawaii and Florida
21 remain the only states that impose a strict one-to-one sterile
2025-2802 SB1433 CDl SMA-l.docx

S.B. NO.
C.D. 1
1 needle and syringe exchange limit. This Act will authorize the
2 State's syringe exchange program to transition from a one-to-one
3 exchange model to a needs-based distribution system.
4 Syringes and needles are not the only injection equipment
S that contribute to the spread of infection. Any materials used
6 in the preparation or administration of drugs may potentially
7 transmit pathogens or cause injury when shared or reused.
8 The Model Syringe Services Program Act, a model legislation
9 released by the White House Office of National Drug Control
10 Policy in December 2021, recommends extending protection from
11 criminal liability under drug paraphernalia statutes to syringe
12 program staff, volunteers, and participants while implementing
13 or accessing program services intended to reduce the
14 transmission of bloodborne infections. This Act amends state
15 law to align with those recommendations.
16 In line with recommendations for improving effectiveness,
17 the State's sterile needle and syringe exchange program also
18 facilitates access to critical health services necessary for
19 participants. These include educating participants about the
20 dangers of contracting HIV through sharing drug injection
21 equipment and offering counseling services and referrals for
2025-2802 SB1433 CDl SMA-l.docx

C.D. 1
1 treatment of substance use disorders. Furthermore, individuals
2 who do not inject drugs but are marginalized often seek harm
3 reduction information, supplies, and referrals to other services
4 through the program. This Act will remove the requirement that
5 the program exclude non-injection drug users, ensuring the
6 program can assist individuals in need when resources are
7 available.
8 Syringe services programs also play a crucial role in
9 collecting and safely disposing of used injection equipment.
10 Safe disposal occurs most effectively if program participants
11 batch all used injection equipment for safe disposal by syringe
12 services programs. However, participants may be reluctant to
13 batch used injection equipment for safe disposal if they risk
14 criminal penalties for drug residue found on used equipment.
15 Extending protection from arrest and prosecution for possession
16 of drug residue on used syringes and needles to program
17 participants will increase the likelihood of proper disposal,
18 thereby reducing public health risks. Program staff regularly
19 encourage participants to batch and return all used injection
20 equipment to the syringe exchange program, not only for the
21 safety of the community, but also to assist in ensuring the

1 program's continuity. For these reasons, the Model Syringe
2 Services Program Act recommends providing immunity from criminal
3 penalties for possession of a controlled substance or other
4 illicit drug due to the presence of residue in a hypodermic
5 needle or syringe or other supplies.
6 The purpose of this Act is to improve the safety,
7 effectiveness, and cost savings of the State's sterile needle
8 and syringe exchange program by amending the program based on
9 current recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and
10 Prevention and the White House Office of National Drug Control
11 Policy's model legislation.
12 SECTION 2. Section 325-111, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
13 amended as follows:
14 1. By adding five new definitions to be appropriately
15 inserted and to read:
16 ""Authorized objects" means objects authorized by the
17 department for dissemination to syringe exchange participants
18 for the purpose of reducing infection or injury; provided that
19 the objects are incidental to syringe exchange. "Authorized
20 objects" may include but is not limited to cookers, cottons, or
21 ties.

5 "Program staff" means an employee of the department or its
6 designee who is specifically tasked with procuring, handling,
7 transporting, and providing sterile needles, syringes, and
8 authorized objects and services to syringe exchange

11 term is defined in section 329-1, remaining in a syringe and
12 needle after the plunger stopper is fully depressed.

14 who receives a sterile needle and syringe pursuant to the
