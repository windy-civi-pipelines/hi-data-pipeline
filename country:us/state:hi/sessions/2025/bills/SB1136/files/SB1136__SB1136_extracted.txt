(d)  For a loss that is otherwise not subject to subsections (b) or (c), in the event of a state of emergency declared pursuant to section 127A-14 that is related to a covered peril and accompanied by an order of civil authority restricting access to the applicable home, additional living expenses coverage shall be provided for at least two weeks.  Additional two-week extensions shall be provided to a policyholder for good cause; provided that each extension shall be subject to any other applicable policy provision. §431:l0E-     Replacement cost value; homeowners insurance policies.  (a)  Beginning on January 1, 2026, each newly issued or renewed homeowners insurance policy that covers a property within the State shall provide for the replacement cost value of the insured property. (b)  As used in this section, "replacement cost value" means the full insurable replacement cost of the insured property, including coverage for increased costs of construction due to inflation or building code requirements at the time the policy is issued and at each renewal date, less deductibles." SECTION 5.  Section 431:10E-102, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsections (a) and (b) to read as follows: "(a) Over-insurance shall be deemed to exist if property or an insurable interest in the property is insured by one or more insurance contracts against the same hazard in any amount in excess of the [actual cash] replacement cost value of the property or of such interest, as determined as of the effective date of the insurance or of any renewal thereof. (b) For the purposes of this section [only, the term actual cash value means the cost of replacement less such depreciation as is properly applicable to the subject insured], "replacement cost value" means the full insurable replacement cost of the insured property, including coverage for increased costs of construction due to inflation or building code requirements at the time the policy is issued and at each renewal date, less deductibles." PART IV SECTION 6.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 7.  In codifying the new sections added by section 1 of this Act, the revisor of statutes shall substitute appropriate section numbers for the letters used in designating the new sections in this Act.

(8)  No insurer shall base any rates on past loss experience within or outside this State." PART III SECTION 4. Chapter 431, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding two new sections to article 10E to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§431:10E-     Claims for additional living expenses under homeowners insurance policies; states of emergency.  (a)  In the event of a loss under a homeowners insurance policy issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, for which the insured has made a claim for additional living expenses, the insurer shall provide the insured with a list of items that the insurer believes may be covered under the policy as additional living expenses.  The list may include a statement that the list is not intended to include all items covered under the policy, but only those that are commonly claimed.  Each insurer may use a list developed by the insurance commissioner. (b) If a covered loss occurs during a state of emergency declared pursuant to section 127A-14, coverage for additional living expenses shall be for a period of not less than twenty‑four months from the inception of the loss; provided that the coverage for additional living expenses shall be subject to other policy provisions.  An insurer shall grant an extension of up to twelve additional months, for a total of thirty-six months, if an insured acts in good faith and is reasonably delayed due to a lack of necessary construction materials or available contractors to perform the necessary work.  Additional six-month extensions shall be provided to policyholders for good cause. (c) No policy that provides coverage for additional living expenses shall limit the policyholder's right to recovery if the insured home is rendered uninhabitable by a covered peril.  An insurer may, in lieu of making living expense payments, provide a reasonable alternative remedy that addresses the property condition that precludes reasonable habitation of the insured premises. The additional living expense coverage pursuant to this section shall not apply to any utility's public safety power shutdown event involving the deenergization of a portion of the electrical distribution or transmission system to reduce the risk of wildfire ignition. (d)  For a loss that is otherwise not subject to subsections (b) or (c), in the event of a state of emergency declared pursuant to section 127A-14 that is related to a covered peril and accompanied by an order of civil authority restricting access to the applicable home, additional living expenses coverage shall be provided for at least two weeks.  Additional two-week extensions shall be provided to a policyholder for good cause; provided that each extension shall be subject to any other applicable policy provision. §431:l0E-     Replacement cost value; homeowners insurance policies.  (a)  Beginning on January 1, 2026, each newly issued or renewed homeowners insurance policy that covers a property within the State shall provide for the replacement cost value of the insured property. (b)  As used in this section, "replacement cost value" means the full insurable replacement cost of the insured property, including coverage for increased costs of construction due to inflation or building code requirements at the time the policy is issued and at each renewal date, less deductibles." SECTION 5.  Section 431:10E-102, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsections (a) and (b) to read as follows: "(a) Over-insurance shall be deemed to exist if property or an insurable interest in the property is insured by one or more insurance contracts against the same hazard in any amount in excess of the [actual cash] replacement cost value of the property or of such interest, as determined as of the effective date of the insurance or of any renewal thereof. (b) For the purposes of this section [only, the term actual cash value means the cost of replacement less such depreciation as is properly applicable to the subject insured], "replacement cost value" means the full insurable replacement cost of the insured property, including coverage for increased costs of construction due to inflation or building code requirements at the time the policy is issued and at each renewal date, less deductibles." PART IV SECTION 6.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 7.  In codifying the new sections added by section 1 of this Act, the revisor of statutes shall substitute appropriate section numbers for the letters used in designating the new sections in this Act. SECTION 8. This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
