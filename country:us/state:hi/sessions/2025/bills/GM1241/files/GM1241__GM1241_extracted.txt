A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO SURFING.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that surfing is of
2 significant cultural, social, and economic value to the people
3 of the State, as well as the many visitors who travel to the
4 State for surfing. In recognition of surfing as a part of the
5 State's history and its long-standing cultural roots in Hawaii,
6 surfing was sanctioned by the department of education and
7 approved by the board of education as a high school sport in
8 2016. However, only one of five local athletic leagues have
9 sponsored surfing. The lack of interscholastic surfing programs
10 limits opportunities for inspired students to pursue competitive
11 surfing.
12 The legislature further finds that surfing is a significant
13 economic driver for the State. Surfing has grown into an
14 important industry in the State, bringing in tourists from all
15 over the world. The State is also known for hosting prestigious
16 surf contests that attract numerous competitors and spectators
17 who are interested in viewing the sport in person. An economic
