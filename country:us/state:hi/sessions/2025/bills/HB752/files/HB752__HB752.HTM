Section 1:
HB752 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 752 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to environmental stewardship fees. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: PART I SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii's natural resources, including reefs, oceans, forests, streams, estuaries, shorelines, and beaches, provide irreplaceable and invaluable benefits to visitors, residents, and the global community. The Hawaii State Constitution makes clear that the State's natural and cultural resources are subject to the public trust and therefore must be managed and protected for the benefit of present and future generations.  The Hawaii State Constitution further requires the State and its agencies to protect and enforce Native Hawaiian rights, including traditional and customary practices associated with, and dependent upon, carefully managed and abundant natural resources. The legislature further finds that Hawaii's natural environment faces significant environmental pressure from the heavy use it receives from persons traveling to enjoy the State's natural resources.  The current underinvestment in the State's natural resources poses a significant liability to the visitor industry; the stability of natural systems, including food systems and water quality; and the ecosystems, services, fisheries, economic resilience, and health and safety of the State. Hawaii residents currently contribute to the protection and management of natural resources through taxes, environmental care, subsistence, cultural practices, and the exercise of the values and practices embodied in the Hawaii State Constitution.  However, with escalating visitor impacts and an increasing global threat to the island ecosystems, there is an immediate need for additional resources to protect, restore, sustain, manage, and conserve natural resources.  A regenerative tourism fee has been suggested by the Hawaii tourism authority as a potential means to obtain these critical resources.  Accordingly, the legislature finds that it is timely to ask visitors who enjoy and reap benefits of Hawaii's natural resources to further contribute to their protection, care, and restoration. The legislature believes that a license requirement for visitors who enjoy Hawaii's public beaches, trails, parks, and ecosystems could generate the necessary funding each year to offset the adverse impacts of visitors and conserve Hawaii's irreplaceable green infrastructure in perpetuity. The legislature further finds that visitor impact fees, which are also known as "green fees" or "environmental protection fees", have been successfully implemented in many visitor destinations throughout the world, including the Galapagos Islands, New Zealand, and Palau.  In these locations, the fees have demonstrated compounding benefits for visitors, residents, and natural landscapes and seascapes. The legislature also believes that it is imperative to raise additional revenues to offset visitor impacts and ensure that a positive environmental legacy is left for future generations.  An environmental stewardship fee provides a reasonable and appropriate way to generate these needed revenues. The legislature believes that establishing an environmental stewardship fee in Hawaii would be a significant and effective way to raise additional revenue to offset visitor impacts and ensure a healthy environment for future generations. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish an environmental stewardship fee program, to be administered by the department of land and natural resources, and require a license for visitors to use Hawaii's public beaches, parks, trails, coastlines, and environment.  The purpose of the environmental stewardship fee program shall be to provide sustained funding for the protection, restoration, regeneration, enhancement, and care of Hawaii's natural and outdoor recreational resources and build resilience of these resources to withstand the impacts of increased visitor use. PART II SECTION 2.  Chapter 171, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "Part    .  Environmental stewardship FEE PROGRAM §171-A  Definitions.  For purposes of this part: "Fund" means the environmental stewardship fee special fund established pursuant to section 171-E.
