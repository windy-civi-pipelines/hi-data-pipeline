SB1263 SD1 THE SENATE S.B. NO. 1263 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 S.D. 1 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO HISTORIC PRESERVATION. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1. The legislature finds that it is critically important to preserve Hawaii's cultural resources, including historic properties and burial sites, as integral elements of the State's heritage. The legislature also recognizes the pressing need to expedite housing development, particularly in transit-oriented development areas, to address the housing shortage and create more housing opportunities in close proximity to transportation. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1)  Create a process for expediting the review of residential transit-oriented development on certain parcels within county-designated transit oriented development zones that have a low risk of affecting historically significant resources; (2)  Further empower lead agencies, including county governments, to make determinations on the potential effects of a project, under certain conditions; (3)  Create a ninety-day calendar limit for the department of land and natural resources to concur or not concur with project effect determinations, under certain conditions; and (4)  Ensure that projects with written concurrence are exempt from further review unless there is a change to the project. SECTION 2.  Section 6E-8, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows: "(a)  Before any agency or officer of the State or its political subdivisions commences any project [which] that may affect historic property, an aviation artifact, or a burial site, the lead agency [or officer] shall [advise the department] render a determination on the potential effect of the project and allow the department an opportunity for review of the effect of the proposed project on historic properties, aviation artifacts, or burial sites, consistent with section 6E-43, especially those listed on the Hawaii register of historic places.  The lead agency shall be the entity with designated responsibility for compliance with this section.  The decision as to which agency serves as the lead agency shall be made by the agencies involved, typically the agency with the greater degree of involvement with the project.  The proposed project shall not be commenced, or if it has already begun, continued, until the department has [given its written concurrence.] been afforded the opportunity to review the project in compliance with this subsection. If: (1)  The proposed project consists of corridors or large land areas; (2)  Access to properties is restricted; or (3)  Circumstances dictate that construction be done in stages, the department may give its written concurrence based on a phased review of the project; provided that there shall be [a] an executed programmatic agreement in place between the department and the project applicant that identifies the entirety of the project scope, project area, and each construction phase and the estimated timelines for each phase[.], and any agreed upon mitigation measures.  The lead agency shall submit documentation of the project to the state historic preservation division's Hawaii cultural resource information system, its successor, or an equivalent means of submission to initiate the ninety-calendar-day review period. The department shall provide written concurrence or non‑concurrence within ninety calendar days after the filing of a request with the department.  The department's ninety‑calendar‑day review period shall encompass any requests for additional information; provided that the review period shall not reset upon the request for additional information; provided further that if the department requests additional information from a project, the department shall have one hundred eighty calendar days to provide written concurrence of non-concurrence. If the department fails to provide written concurrence or non-concurrence with a project effect determination within ninety calendar days, or within thirty calendar days if no historic properties are to be affected, of receiving a complete and true project submittal, the lead agency may assume the department's concurrence and the project may move to the next step in the compliance process; provided that the lead agency notifies the department of the action in writing and provides documentation of the historic preservation review that complies with section 6E-1, including the evaluation of effects to historic properties and any mitigation or other measures to resolve the effects. The agency or officer seeking to proceed with the project, or any person, may appeal the department's concurrence or non‑concurrence, or failure to provide written concurrence or non-concurrence within the ninety-calendar-day review period, to the Hawaii historic places review board.  An agency, officer, or other person who is dissatisfied with the decision of the review board may apply to the governor, who may take action as the governor deems best in overruling or sustaining the department. Once the department has provided written concurrence on the project effect determination and any necessary mitigation measures have been identified and agreed upon for a proposed project, the appropriate agency or officer of the State or any of its political subdivisions may commence the project, and the project shall be exempt from further review by the department unless there is a change to the project's physical scope of work or project area or unless additional historic properties, aviation artifacts, or burial sites are identified within the project area; provided that, for the purposes of this subsection, "physical scope of work" means the size, location, and depth or ground disturbances.  The notification process shall conform to section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and the department's mitigation process." SECTION 3.  Section 6E-10, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows: "(a)  Before any construction, alteration, disposition or improvement of any nature, by, for, or permitted by a private landowner may be commenced [which] that will affect an historic property on the Hawaii register of historic places, the landowner shall notify the department of the construction, alteration, disposition, or improvement of any nature and allow the department opportunity for review of the effect of the proposed construction, alteration, disposition, or improvement of any nature on the historic property.  The proposed construction, alteration, disposition, or improvement of any nature shall not be commenced, or in the event it has already begun, continue, until the department shall have given its concurrence or ninety calendar days have elapsed.  Within ninety calendar days after notification, the department shall: (1)  Commence condemnation proceedings for the purchase of the historic property if the department and property owner do not agree upon an appropriate course of action; (2)  Permit the owner to proceed with the owner's construction, alteration, or improvement; or (3)  In coordination with the owner, undertake or permit the investigation, recording, preservation, and salvage of any historical information deemed necessary to preserve Hawaiian history, by any qualified agency for this purpose. The lead agency shall submit documentation of the project to the state historic preservation division's Hawaii cultural resource information system, its successor, or an equivalent means of submission to initiate the ninety-calendar-day review period. The department's ninety-calendar-day review period shall encompass any requests for additional information; provided that the review period shall not reset upon the request for additional information; provided further that if the department requests additional information from a project, the department shall have one hundred eighty calendar days to provide written concurrence of non-concurrence. Once the department has provided written concurrence on the project effect determination and any necessary mitigation measures have been identified and agreed upon for a proposed project, the property owner may commence the project, and the project shall be exempt from further review by the department unless there is a change to the project's physical scope of work or project area or unless additional historic properties, aviation artifacts, or burial sites are identified within the project area; provided that, for the purposes of this subsection, "physical scope of work" means the size, location, and depth of ground disturbances. If the department does not provide written concurrence or non-concurrence within ninety calendar days, or within thirty calendar days if no historic properties are to be affected, then the department shall be presumed to concur with the agency or officer's submittal.  The agency or officer may then proceed with the project; provided that the agency or officer notifies the department of the action in writing and provides documentation of the historic preservation review that complies with section 6E-1, including the evaluation of effects to historic properties and any mitigation or other measures to resolve the effects." SECTION 4.  Section 6E-42, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§6E-42  Review of proposed projects. (a)  Except as provided in section 6E-42.2, before any agency or officer of the State or its political subdivisions approves any project involving a permit, license, certificate, land use change, subdivision, or other entitlement for use, which may affect historic property, aviation artifacts, or a burial site, the agency or office shall advise the department and [prior to] before any approval allow the department an opportunity for review and comment on the effect of the proposed project on historic properties, aviation artifacts, or burial sites, consistent with section 6E-43, including those listed in the Hawaii register of historic places. If: (1)  The proposed project consists of corridors or large land areas; (2)  Access to properties is restricted; or (3)  Circumstances dictate that construction be done in stages, the department's review and comment may be based on a phased review of the project; provided that there shall be a programmatic agreement between the department and the project applicant that identifies each phase and the estimated timelines for each phase. The lead agency shall submit documentation of the project to the state historic preservation division's Hawaii cultural resource information system, its successor, or an equivalent means of submission. The department's ninety-calendar-day review period shall encompass any requests for additional information; provided that the review period shall not reset upon the request for additional information; provided further that if the department requests additional information from a project, the department shall have one hundred eighty calendar days to provide written concurrence of non-concurrence. Once the department has provided written concurrence on the project effect determination and any necessary mitigation measures have been identified and agreed upon for a proposed project, the appropriate agency or officer of the State or any of its political subdivisions may commence the project, and the project shall be exempt from further review by the department unless there is a change to the project's physical scope of work or project area or unless additional historic properties, aviation artifacts, or burial sites are identified within the project area; provided that, for the purposes of this subsection, "physical scope of work" means the size, location, and depth of ground disturbances. If the department does not provide written concurrence or non-concurrence within ninety calendar days, or within thirty calendar days if no historic properties are to be affected, then the department shall be presumed to concur with the agency or officer's submittal.  The agency or officer may then proceed with the project; provided that the agency or officer notifies the department of the action in writing and provides documentation of the historic preservation review that complies with section 6E-1, including the evaluation of effects to historic properties and any mitigation or other measures to resolve the effects. (b) The department shall inform the public of any project proposals submitted to it under this section that are not otherwise subject to the requirement of a public hearing or other public notification. (c) Counties deriving and expending revenues on mass transit stations pursuant to section 46-16.8 may request programmatic review by the department for residential transit‑oriented development where a permit, license, certificate, land use change, subdivision, or other entitlement may be required.
