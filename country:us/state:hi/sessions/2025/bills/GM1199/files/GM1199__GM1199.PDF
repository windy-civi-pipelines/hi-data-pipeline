C.D. 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
RELATING TO CONSERVATION ENFORCEMENT.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAH:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds that coral reefs are
2 extremely valuable to the people of Hawaii and provide benefits
3 such as coastal protection from erosion due to rising sea levels
4 and larger ocean swells as the ocean warms; sand production that
5 replenishes beaches; and fisheries, recreation, tourism, and
6 spiritual connection. The legislature further finds that many
7 reefs around the island of Oahu are widely known to be among the
8 most degraded in the State, due to historically poor land use
9 practices that buried corals with silt run-off and smothered
10 corals with seaweeds fertilized by leaching sewage and
11 fertilizer run-off. The legislature also finds that warmer
12 ocean temperatures are now causing more frequent and severe
13 coral bleaching events that kill corals and are predicted to be
14 annual events by about 2040. Ocean acidification and other
15 pollutants also adversely affect corals.
16 The legislature additionally finds that one of the most
17 effective ways to help corals withstand and recover from present

1 and future threats is to ensure the existence of many
2 herbivorous fishes on Hawaii's reefs, especially parrotfishes
3 (uhu), surgeonfishes (kala and others), and chubs (nenue).
4 These fishes are known to crop seaweeds that would otherwise
5 smother corals, providing space on the reefs for new corals to
6 grow, especially after coral bleaching events. The population
7 of herbivorous fishes around Oahu is by far the lowest in
8 Hawaii.
9 The legislature finds that the board of land and natural
10 resources adopted statewide herbivore fishing rules in December
11 2023 to protect herbivorous fish populations in the State.
12 However, enforcement-of these rules, which is the responsibility
13 of the division of conservation and resources enforcement of the
14 department of land and natural resources, has been particularly
15 difficult around Oahu because:
16 (1) Pishing intensity is much greater on Oahu than on the
17 other islands;
18 (2) Division of conservation and resources enforcement
19 officers have been diverted to law enforcement duties
20 on land due to recent increases in violent crime; and

1 (3) Most poaching of herbivorous fish occurs at night,
2 which poses an extreme challenge to the several
3 division of conservation and resources enforcement
4 officers available for marine night patrols,
5 especially given the lack of needed equipment.
6 Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds
7 for equipment for the Oahu branch of the division of
8 conservation and resources enforcement of the department of land
9 and natural resources.
10 SECTION 2. There is appropriated out of the general
11 revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $4,974,040 or so much
12 thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 for
13 equipment for the Oahu branch of the division of conservation
14 and resources enforcement of the department of land and natural
15 resources, to be allocated as follows:
16 (1) $800,000 for two maritime enforcement patrol vessels,
17 complete with audible/visual emergency equipment;
18 (2) $50,000 for two patrol watercrafts, complete with
19 audible/visual emergency equipment;
20 (3) $50,000 for shipment costs for the items in paragraphs
21 (1) and (2);
