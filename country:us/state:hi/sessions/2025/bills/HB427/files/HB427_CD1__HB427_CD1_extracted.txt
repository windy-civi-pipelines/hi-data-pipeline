SECTION 12.  Section 159-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "[[]§159-2[]]  Findings and declaration of necessity.  It is hereby declared that the meat industry is a paramount agricultural industry of this State and the production and marketing of meat is an enterprise that is of significant importance to the economy of this State and to the health of the consuming public.  It is essential to the public health and welfare of consumers that they be protected by assuring that meat and meat products distributed to them are wholesome, not adulterated, and properly marked, labeled, and packaged. Unwholesome, adulterated, or misbranded meat or meat products are injurious to the public health and welfare, destroy markets for wholesome, unadulterated, and properly labeled and packaged meat and meat products and result in sundry losses to livestock producers and processors of meat and meat products, as well as injury to consumers. The unwholesome, adulterated, mislabeled, or deceptively packaged articles can be sold at lower prices and compete unfairly with the wholesome, unadulterated, and properly labeled and packaged articles, to the detriment of consumers and the public generally.  It is hereby found that regulation by the department of agriculture and biosecurity and cooperation by this State with the United States Department of Agriculture as contemplated by this Hawaii Meat Inspection Act is appropriate to protect the health and welfare of consumers and otherwise to effectuate the purposes of this chapter. Congress enacted the Meat Inspection Act in 1907 (Public Law 59-242), as amended by the Wholesome Meat Act in 1967 (Public Law 90-201) which is now redesignated as the Federal Meat Inspection Act.  The Federal Meat Inspection Act is intended to protect the consuming public from adulterated or misbranded meat and meat products and to assist the states in their efforts to accomplish this objective. The Federal Meat Inspection Act authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to furnish financial and related assistance to states for the administration of meat inspection programs which conform to established federal standards up to fifty per cent of the estimated total cost of the cooperative program.  Presently, the meat processing industry in this State is not subject to any meat inspection law or rules and regulations that meet the minimum federal requirement in this area.  This State, in order to qualify for the cooperative program, must demonstrate "progressive action" by November 15, 1969; and, further, all physical facilities must be upgraded in accordance with the established federal standards by November 15, 1970.  Failure to comply with the federal standards prescribed by the Federal Meat Inspection Act will result in federal control of the meat and meat processing industries of the State.  Accordingly, the State deems it to be in the best interest of the public health and welfare to take those steps as are necessary to qualify for federal financial and related assistance for the administration of a meat inspection program which conforms to federal standards prescribed in the Federal Meat Inspection Act." SECTION 13.  Section 161-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§161-2 Findings and declaration of necessity.  It is hereby declared that the poultry industry is a paramount agricultural industry of this State and the production and marketing of poultry is an enterprise that is of significant importance to the economy of the State and to the health of the consuming public.  It is essential to the public health and welfare of consumers that they be protected by assuring that poultry or poultry products distributed to them are wholesome, not adulterated, and properly marked, labeled, and packaged.  Unwholesome, adulterated, or misbranded poultry or poultry products are injurious to the public health and welfare, destroy markets for wholesome, not adulterated, and properly labeled and packaged poultry or poultry products, and result in sundry losses to poultry producers and processors of poultry as well as injury to consumers.  The unwholesome, adulterated, mislabeled, or deceptively packaged articles can be sold at lower prices and compete unfairly with the wholesome, not adulterated, and properly labeled and packaged articles, to the detriment of consumers and the public generally.  It is hereby found that regulation by the department of agriculture and biosecurity and cooperation by this State with the United States Department of Agriculture as contemplated by this chapter is appropriate to protect the health and welfare of consumers and otherwise to effectuate the purposes of this chapter. The 90th Congress enacted Public Law 90-492, entitled "The Wholesome Poultry Products Act", which is now redesignated as the "Poultry Products Inspection Act".  The Poultry Products Inspection Act is intended to protect the consuming public from adulterated or misbranded poultry or poultry products and to assist the states in their efforts to accomplish this objective. The Poultry Products Inspection Act authorizes the United States Secretary of Agriculture to furnish financial and related assistance to states for the administration of poultry inspection programs which conform to established federal standards up to fifty per cent of the estimated total cost of the cooperative program.  Hawaii's poultry industry is not subject to poultry inspection law or rules and regulations that meet the minimum federal requirement in this area.  In order to qualify for the cooperative program, the State must demonstrate "progressive action" by July 18, 1970; and, further, all physical facilities must be upgraded in accordance with the established federal standards by July 18, 1971.  Failure to comply with the standards prescribed by the Poultry Products Inspection Act will result in federal control of the poultry or poultry processing industries of the State.  Accordingly, the State of Hawaii deems it to be in the interest of the State's public health and welfare to take [such] steps as are necessary to qualify for federal financial and related assistance for the administration of a poultry inspection program which conforms to federal standards prescribed in the Poultry Products Inspection Act." SECTION 14.  Section 205-47, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows: "(b)  Each county shall develop maps of potential lands to be considered for designation as important agricultural lands in consultation and cooperation with landowners[,]; the department of agriculture[,] and biosecurity; agricultural interest groups, including representatives from the Hawaii Farm Bureau Federation and other agricultural organizations[,]; the United States Department of Agriculture  Natural Resources Conservation Service[,]; the office of planning and sustainable development[,]; and other groups as necessary." SECTION 15.  Section 219-8, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§219-8 Participation in loans by the department. (1)  The department of agriculture and biosecurity may provide funds for a share, not to exceed ninety per cent, of the principal amount of a loan made to a qualified aquaculturist by a private lender who is otherwise unable [otherwise] to lend the applicant sufficient funds at reasonable rates where the qualified farmer is unable to obtain sufficient funds for the same purpose from the United States Department of Agriculture; (2)  Participation loans under this section shall be limited by the provisions of section 219-6 and the department of [agriculture's] agriculture and biosecurity's share shall not exceed the maximum amounts specified therefor; (3)  Interest charged on the private lender's share of the loan shall not be more than the sum of two per cent above the lowest rate of interest charged by all state or national banks authorized to accept or hold deposits in the State on secured short term loans made to borrowers who have the highest credit rating with those banks; (4)  The private lender's share of the loan may be insured by the department up to ninety per cent of the principal balance of the loan, under section 219-7; (5)  When a participation loan has been approved by the department, its share shall be paid to the participating private lender for disbursement to the borrower.  The private lender shall collect all payments from the borrower and otherwise service the loan; (6)  Out of interest collected, the private lender may be paid a service fee to be determined by the department [which fee] that shall not exceed one per cent of the unpaid principal balance of the loan; provided that this fee shall not be added to any amount which the borrower is obligated to pay; (7)  The participating private lender may take over a larger percentage or the full principal balance of the loan at any time that it has determined, to the satisfaction of the department, that the borrower is able to pay any increased interest charges resulting; and (8)  Security for participation loans shall be limited by section 219-5(a)(6).  All collateral documents shall be held by the private lender.  Division of interest in collateral received shall be in proportion to participation by the department and the private lender." SECTION 16.  Section 460J-26, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§460J-26 Exemptions.  This chapter shall not apply to: (1)  Officials of the federal government on military reservations; (2)  Personnel of the United States Department of Agriculture, [the] state department of agriculture[, or] and biosecurity, state department of land and natural resources, or [the] United States Public Health Service in the performance of their official duties; (3)  Other government employees who conduct research on pesticides or pest control or who use pesticides in the performance of their duties; (4)  Qualified scientific personnel specially exempted by the board; (5)  Persons engaged in pest control for agricultural purposes; or (6)  Engineers or architects licensed under chapter 464 who: (A)  Draft or prepare design documents that prescribe anti-termite or anti-pest measures, including the specification of termiticides, that are required by the building code and other governmental agencies; (B)  Conduct building condition or assessment surveys to observe and evaluate the condition of the building or structure, if the primary purpose of these surveys is not to report on the identification of infestations; or (C)  Prepare reports based on the results of the surveys specified in subparagraph (B) that identify the location, extent, and probable cause of the pest damage (e.g., "termite damage"); provided that where a report concerns termite damage, the particular type or species of termite shall not be specified unless the report is written in consultation with a licensed pest control operator licensed in termite control or other duly recognized expert in urban entomology, such as an insect taxonomist or urban entomologist with expertise in the identification or control of termites; and provided further that if a licensed pest control operator is not consulted, the report shall include a recommendation that a licensed pest control operator be contracted for further assessment or treatment."

(e)  If the governor requisitions and takes control of any property or the temporary use thereof, the owner, or other person entitled thereto, shall be paid a sum, determined by the governor to be fair and just compensation for the property or use, within twenty days after the property has been requisitioned and taken, or in monthly or lesser installments if the property is taken for temporary use. If any person is unwilling to accept the sum determined by the governor as full and complete compensation for the property or use, the person shall be paid seventy-five per cent of that sum and may sue the State for an additional sum that, when added to the sum already received by the person, the person may consider fair and just compensation for the property or use, in the manner provided by chapter 661 for actions against the State; provided that: (1)  Any suit under this section shall be instituted within two years after the requisition in the case of the taking of real property in fee simple, or within one year after the requisition in all other cases, subject to sections 657-13 to 657-15, which are hereby made applicable to the suit; (2)  No more than six months shall be allowed for the bringing of a suit after the appointment of a conservator of a person under disability, or the removal of the disability, or after the appointment of personal representatives; and (3)  Recovery shall be confined to the fair market value of the property or its fair rental value, as the case may be, without any allowance for prospective profits, or punitive or other damages. If the owner of property, or other person entitled to compensation for the requisitioning of property or use thereof, is under a disability, or has died, and no conservator or personal representative has been appointed, the State, acting through the attorney general, may apply for the appointment of a conservator or for the appointment of a personal representative. (f)  The governor shall appoint a board of three disinterested certified appraisers with whom may be filed any claim for damages arising out of any failure to return private property, the temporary use of which was requisitioned, or which was leased, or any claim for damages arising out of the condition in which the private property is returned.  No claim may be filed for deterioration of property resulting from ordinary wear and tear and not for any deterioration or damage, except any that is shown to have resulted from the taking or use of the property; provided that any claim shall be filed within thirty days after the return of the property or after the governor proclaims that all private property has been returned to the owners, whichever is earlier.  The decision of the appraisers shall be final and binding upon the governor and the claimant.  Either party may file a petition in the circuit court within sixty days after the rendering of a decision of the board of appraisers, praying for the decision of the court upon the claim.  The petition, if filed by the State, shall be entitled in the name of the State by the attorney general and shall be heard and decided by the circuit court without the intervention of a jury.  If filed by any other party, the petition shall be filed, heard, and decided in the manner provided for suits against the State.  Appellate review may be had, subject to chapter 602, in the manner provided for civil appeals from the circuit courts.  The court may order the joinder of other parties or may allow other parties to intervene.  Any award that has become final shall be paid out of any funds available under this chapter and, if not sufficient, out of the general revenues of the State as appropriated." SECTION 23.  Section 150A-52, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§150A-52  Objectives of biosecurity program.  The objectives of the biosecurity program shall be to: (1)  Establish a multi-dimensional system to survey for and prevent the entry into the State and interisland movement of pests and prohibited or restricted organisms without a permit; (2)  Respond effectively to eradicate, control, reduce, and suppress incipient pest populations and established pests and seize and dispose of prohibited or restricted organisms without a permit; and (3)  Coordinate with partner agencies and organizations to direct the control and eradication of [invasive species.] pests." SECTION 24.  Section 150A-53, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§150A-53  General actions to achieve objectives.  (a)  To achieve the objectives of the biosecurity program, the department shall plan for and, within available legislative appropriations or through funding from other sources, implement the following: (1)  Work with government agencies and agricultural commodity exporters of other states and countries to establish pre-entry inspection programs under which inbound cargo into the State is inspected at the ports of departure or other points outside the State; (2)  Establish, operate, or participate in operating port-of-entry facilities where multiple government agencies may inspect, quarantine, fumigate, disinfect, destroy, or exclude as appropriate, articles that may harbor pests or prohibited or restricted organisms or exclude articles that are prohibited or restricted without a permit, with the goals of: (A)  Performing inspections in an efficient, effective, and expeditious manner for the government agencies involved and for cargo owners, carriers, and importers; and (B)  Providing for the proper and safe storage and handling of cargo, especially agricultural and food commodities, awaiting inspection; (3)  Develop, implement, and coordinate post-entry measures to eradicate, control, reduce, and suppress pests and, as appropriate, eradicate or seize and dispose of prohibited or restricted organisms without a permit that have entered the State; (4)  Collaborate with relevant government agencies, agricultural commodity importers, and other persons to examine and develop joint integrated systems to better implement the biosecurity program; (5)  Improve cargo inspection capabilities and methods, including enhancement of the content and submission requirements for cargo manifests and agricultural commodity ownership and movement certificates; (6)  Promote the production of agricultural commodities in the State to reduce cargo shipments of imported commodities into the State; and (7)  Provide public education on [the]: (A)  The negative effects of pests and prohibited or restricted organisms without a permit, to the environment and economy of the State[.]; (B)  Reporting pests and prohibited or restricted organisms without a permit that are discovered or suspected to be present in imported products; and (C)  Protecting imported products to prevent pest infestation. (b)  For purposes of the biosecurity program, the department may: (1)  Subpoena any necessary documentation from importers relating to a discovered or suspected infestation of a pest or prohibited or restricted organism; and (2)  Declare a biosecurity emergency pursuant to section 150A-   . [(b)] (c)  The department shall establish parameters and construction requirements for biosecurity facilities that provide for and ensure the safety of agricultural and food commodities consumed by Hawaii residents, including cold storage facilities established by private-public partnerships to preserve the quality and ensure the safety of the commodities arriving at the State's airports and harbors." PART IV SECTION 25.  The legislature finds that New Zealand's use of transitional facilities has increased the country's biosecurity while improving the efficiency of importing goods.  In New Zealand, most imported goods subject to inspection are transported away from the airport or seaport to one of six thousand five hundred privately-run secure transitional facilities.  At the transitional facility, a private individual licensed by the government inspects the goods for disease, infection, infestation, and other matters of concern. The legislature further finds that New Zealand's process allows for a more efficient flow of goods entering the country by reducing delays or stoppages at the ports of entry while also ensuring that all relevant goods are properly inspected before delivery to their destination. The purpose of this part is to enhance Hawaii's biosecurity measures by authorizing the establishment of similar transitional facilities in the State along with licenses for private individuals to inspect the imported goods. SECTION 26.  Chapter 150A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding five new sections to part II to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§150A-A  Transitional facilities; uses.  (a) Upon notification by the department, items at a pier, airport, or other place where the items are first received may be transported to a transitional facility suitable for the items. (b)  Items transported pursuant to subsection (a) shall be transported in a manner that they will not spread or be likely to spread any infestation or infection of insects or diseases that may be present. (c)  All costs and expenses incident to the use of a transitional facility shall be borne by the importer or the importer's agent.  For the purposes of this subsection, "import" (and any nounal, verbal, adjectival, adverbial, and other equivalent for the term used interchangeably in this subsection) means to bring or attempt to bring goods or products into the State, and includes items labeled or designated as samples, even if not intended for retail sale, subject to this chapter. (d)  No items shall be transported out of a transitional facility unless: (1)  Authorized by the department; or (2)  Certified by a biosecurity compliance auditor that the items are free of diseases, infections, infestations, and other items that the department deems relevant. §150A-B  Transitional facilities; established.  The department shall establish standards for transitional facilities, including standards for the construction, maintenance, and operation of transitional facilities.  The department may establish standards for transitional facilities pursuant to the types of items stored by those facilities, and corresponding classes of licensure. §150A-C  Transitional facility license.  (a) No person shall operate a transitional facility without a transitional facility license and under the terms of a signed compliance agreement. (b)  A person may apply to the department for a transitional facility license.  The application shall be made under oath on forms provided by the department and shall contain information as prescribed by the department, including the following: (1)  The name, business address, telephone number, social security number, and, where applicable, the federal tax identification number of the applicant; (2)  The proposed location of the transitional facility; and (3)  The type of items the transitional facility will hold. (c)  The department shall establish standards for transitional facilities, including: (1)  Standards for construction, maintenance, security, and operation; and (2)  Quarterly inspections; provided that the department may perform periodic random inspections to ensure compliance. (d)  The department may suspend or revoke a transitional facility license if the transitional facility does not satisfy the standards established by the department under subsection (c) or the department determines that the transitional facility is not in compliance under the terms of the compliance agreement. §150A-D  Biosecurity compliance auditor; certification.  (a)  The department shall certify biosecurity compliance auditors and offer training to individuals seeking a biosecurity compliance auditor certification. (b)  The training shall include: (1)  The identification of diseases, infections, infestations, and other subjects that the department deems relevant; and (2)  Procedures following the identification of a disease, infection, infestation, or other subject that the department deems relevant. (c)  Upon completion of the training and satisfaction of other requirements under the compliance agreement, the department shall issue a biosecurity compliance auditor certification to the individual.  The certification shall be valid for one year, shall identify the specific transitional facility where the biosecurity compliance auditor is authorized to conduct compliance audits, and may be renewed under requirements established by the department. (d)  The department may require each biosecurity compliance auditor to complete additional training as needed, including any emergency training in the interests of biosecurity. (e)  The department may revoke or suspend any biosecurity compliance auditor certification for good cause. (f)  A biosecurity compliance auditor may be employed by the owner of a transitional facility. (g)  The department may charge reasonable fees for the training, certification, and certification renewal under this section. §150A-E  Biosecurity compliance auditor; powers.  (a)  Subject to the terms of the compliance agreement, a certified biosecurity compliance auditor may certify items located in a transitional facility as free of diseases, infections, infestations, and other items that the department deems relevant. (b)  Unless authorized by the department, a certified biosecurity compliance auditor shall not certify any items located outside a transitional facility where the certified biosecurity compliance auditor is authorized to conduct inspections to ensure compliance." SECTION 27.  Section 150A-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding two new definitions to be appropriately inserted and to read as follows: ""Biosecurity compliance auditor" means an individual with a valid biosecurity compliance auditor certification issued under section 150A-D. "Transitional facility" means a facility with a valid transitional facility license issued under section 150A-C." SECTION 28.  Section 150A-5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§150A-5 Conditions of importation. The importation into the State of any of the following articles, viz., nursery-stock, tree, shrub, herb, vine, cut-flower, cut-foliage, cutting, graft, scion, bud, seed, leaf, root, or rhizome; nut, fruit, or vegetable; grain, cereal, or legume in the natural or raw state; moss, hay, straw, dry-grass, or other forage; unmanufactured log, limb, or timber, or any other plant-growth or plant-product, unprocessed or in the raw state; soil; microorganisms; live bird, reptile, nematode, insect, or any other animal in any stage of development (that is in addition to the so-called domestic animal, the quarantine of which is provided for in chapter 142); box, vehicle, baggage, or any other container in which the articles have been transported or any packing material used in connection therewith shall be made in the manner hereinafter set forth: (1)  Notification of arrival.  Any person who receives for transport or brings or causes to be brought to the State as freight, air freight, baggage, or otherwise, for the purpose of debarkation or entry therein, or as ship's stores, any of the foregoing articles, shall, immediately upon the arrival thereof, notify the department[, in writing,] of the arrival, giving the waybill number, container number, name and address of the consignor, name and address of the consignee or the consignee's agent in the State, marks, number of packages, description of contents of each package, port at which laden, and any other information that may be necessary to locate or identify the same, and shall hold the articles at the pier, airport, [or] any other place where they are first received or discharged, or a transitional facility, in a manner that they will not spread or be likely to spread any infestation or infection of insects or diseases that may be present until inspection and examination can be made by the inspector or a certified biosecurity compliance auditor to determine whether [or not] any article, or any portion thereof, is infested or infected with or contains any pest.  The department may adopt rules to require identification of specific articles on negotiable and non-negotiable warehouse receipts, bills of lading, or other documents of title for inspection of pests.  In addition, the department shall adopt rules to designate restricted articles that shall require: (A)  A permit from the department in advance of importation; or (B)  A department letter of authorization or registration in advance of importation. The restricted articles shall include but not be limited to certain microorganisms or living insects.  Failure to obtain the permit, letter of authorization, or registration in advance is a violation of this section; (2)  Individual passengers, officers, and crew. (A)  It shall be the responsibility of the transportation company to distribute, prior to the debarkation of passengers and baggage, the State of Hawaii [plant and animal] biosecurity declaration [form in paper or electronic form] to each passenger, officer, and crew member of any aircraft or vessel originating in the continental United States or its possessions or from any other area not under the jurisdiction of the appropriate federal agency in order that the passenger, officer, or crew member can comply with the directions and requirements appearing thereon.  All passengers, officers, and crew members, whether or not they are bringing or causing to be brought for entry into the State [the] any articles listed [on the form], shall complete the declaration, except that one adult member of a family may complete the declaration for other family members. Any person who [defaces the declaration form required under this section,] gives false information, fails to declare restricted articles in the person's possession or baggage, or fails to declare in cargo manifests is in violation of this section; (B)  [Completed paper forms shall be collected by the transportation company and be delivered, immediately upon arrival, to the inspector at the first airport or seaport of arrival.  Completed electronic forms shall be transmitted to the inspector before passengers depart the first airport or seaport of arrival.  Failure to distribute or collect paper declaration forms, immediately deliver completed paper forms, or transmit completed electronic forms before passengers depart the first airport or seaport of arrival is a violation of this section; and] All passengers, officers, and crew members who are bringing or causing to be brought for entry into the State domestic and other animals cited in chapter 142, in addition to the articles enumerated in this chapter, shall immediately upon arrival or prior to arrival notify the department of the arrival of any restricted article.  The department may adopt rules necessary to effectuate this subparagraph; and (C)  It shall be the responsibility of the officers and crew of an aircraft or vessel originating in the continental United States or its possessions or from any other area not under the jurisdiction of the appropriate federal agency to immediately report all sightings of any plants and animals to the plant quarantine branch.  Failure to comply with this requirement is a violation of this section; [(3)  Plant and animal declaration form.  The form shall include directions for declaring domestic and other animals cited in chapter 142, in addition to the articles enumerated in this chapter; (4)] (3)  Labels.  Each container in which any of the above‑mentioned articles are imported into the State shall be plainly and legibly marked, in a conspicuous manner and place, with the name and address of the shipper or owner forwarding or shipping the same, the name or mark of the person to whom the same is forwarded or shipped or the person's agent, the name of the country, state, or territory and locality therein where the product was grown or produced, and a statement of the contents of the container.  Upon failure to comply with this paragraph, the importer or carrier is in violation of this section; [(5)] (4)  Authority to inspect.  Whenever the inspector has good cause to believe that the provisions of this chapter are being violated, the inspector may: (A)  Enter and inspect any aircraft, vessel, or other carrier at any time after its arrival within the boundaries of the State, whether offshore, at the pier, or at the airport, for the purpose of determining whether any of the articles or pests enumerated in this chapter or rules adopted thereto, is present; (B)  Enter into or upon any pier, warehouse, airport, or any other place in the State where any of the above-mentioned articles are moved or stored, for the purpose of ascertaining, by inspection and examination, whether [or not] any of the articles is infested or infected with any pest or disease or contaminated with soil or contains prohibited plants or animals; and (C)  Inspect any baggage or personal effects of disembarking passengers, officers, and crew members on aircraft or vessels arriving in the State to ascertain if they contain any of the articles or pests enumerated in this chapter.  No baggage or other personal effects of the passengers or crew members shall be released until the baggage or effects have been passed. Baggage or cargo inspection shall be made at the discretion of the inspector, on the pier, vessel, or aircraft or in any quarantine or inspection area. Whenever the inspector has good cause to believe that the provisions of this chapter are being violated, the inspector may require that any box, package, suitcase, or any other container carried as ship's stores, cargo, or otherwise by any vessel or aircraft moving between the continental United States and Hawaii or between the [Hawaiian Islands,] islands of the State, be opened for inspection to determine whether any article or pest prohibited by this chapter or by rules adopted pursuant thereto is present.  It is a violation of this section if any prohibited article or any pest or any plant, fruit, or vegetable infested with plant pests is found; [(6)] (5)  Request for importation and inspection.  In addition to requirements of the United States customs authorities concerning invoices or other formalities incident to importations into the State, the importer shall be required to file a written statement with the department, signed by the importer or the importer's agent, setting forth the importer's desire to import certain of the above-mentioned articles into the State and: (A)  Giving the following additional information: (i)  The kind (scientific name), quantity, and description; (ii)  The locality where same were grown or produced; (iii)  Certification that all animals to be imported are the progeny of captive populations or have been held in captivity for a period of one year immediately before importation or have been specifically approved for importation by the board; (iv)  The port from which the same were last shipped; (v)  The name of the shipper; and (vi)  The name of the consignee; and (B)  Containing: (i)  A request that the department, by its duly authorized agent, examine the articles described; (ii)  An agreement by the importer to be responsible for all costs, charges, or expenses; and (iii)  A waiver of all claims for damages incident to the inspection or the fumigation, disinfection, quarantine, or destruction of the articles, or any of them, as hereinafter provided, if any treatment is deemed necessary. Failure or refusal to file a statement, including the agreement and waiver, is a violation of this section and may, in the discretion of the department, be sufficient cause for refusing to permit the entry of the articles into the State; [(7)] (6)  Place of inspection.  If, in the judgment of the [inspector,] department, it is deemed necessary or advisable to move any of the above-mentioned articles, or any portion thereof, to a transitional facility or another place more suitable for inspection than the pier, airport, or any other place where they are first received or discharged, the [inspector] department is authorized to do so[.] or order the importer or importer's agent to do so.  All costs and expenses incident to the movement and transportation of the articles to any other place shall be borne by the importer or the importer's agent.  If the importer, importer's agent, or transportation company requests inspection of sealed containers of the above-mentioned articles at locations other than where the articles are first received or discharged or a transitional facility and the department determines that inspection at the other place is appropriate, the department may require payment of costs necessitated by these inspections, including overtime costs; [(8)] (7)  Disinfection or quarantine.  If, upon inspection, any article received or brought into the State for the purpose of debarkation or entry therein is found to be infested or infected or there is reasonable cause to presume that it is infested or infected and the infestation or infection can, in the judgment of the inspector, be eradicated, a treatment shall be given [such] to the article.  The treatment shall be at the expense of the owner or the owner's agent, and the treatment shall be as prescribed by the department.  The article shall be held in quarantine at the expense of the owner or the owner's agent at a satisfactory place approved by the department for a sufficient length of time to determine that eradication has been accomplished.  If the infestation or infection is of the nature or extent that it cannot be effectively and completely eradicated, or if it is a potentially destructive pest or it is not widespread in the State, or after treatment it is determined that the infestation or infection is not completely eradicated, or if the owner or the owner's agent refuses to allow the article to be treated or to be responsible for the cost of treatment and quarantine, the article, or any portion thereof, together with all packing and containers, may, at the discretion of the inspector, be destroyed or sent out of the State at the expense of the owner or the owner's agent.  The destruction or exclusion shall not be made the basis of a claim against the department or the inspector for damage or loss incurred; [(9)] (8)  Disposition.  Upon completion of inspection, either at the time of arrival or at any time thereafter should any article be held for inspection, treatment, or quarantine, the inspector shall affix to the article or the container or to the delivery order in a conspicuous place thereon, a tag, label, or stamp to indicate that the article has been inspected and passed.  This action shall constitute a permit to bring the article into the State; and [(10)] (9)  Ports of entry.  None of the articles mentioned in this section shall be allowed entry into the State except through the airports and seaports in the State designated and approved by the board." SECTION 29.  Section 150A-5.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows: "(b)  In legal effect, articles landed for the purpose of inspection or quarantine shall be construed to be still outside the State seeking entry, and shall not, in whole or in part, be considered suitable for entry into the State unless a tag, label, or stamp has been affixed to the article, its container, or its delivery order by the inspector as provided in section [150A-5(9),] 150A-5(8), except that articles quarantined in the biocontrol containment facilities of the department or of other government agencies engaged in joint projects with the department may be released upon issuance of a permit approved by the board." SECTION 30.  Section 150A-8, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§150A-8 Transporting in State.  (a)  Flora and fauna specified by rules and regulations of the department shall not be moved from one island to another island within the State or from one locality to another on the same island except by a permit issued by the department. (b)  The movement between the islands of the State of the following articles, viz., nursery‑stock, tree, shrub, herb, vine, cut-flower, cut-foliage, cutting, graft, scion, bud, seed, leaf, root, or rhizome; nut, fruit, or vegetable; grain, cereal, or legume in the natural or raw state; moss, hay, straw, dry-grass, or other forage; unmanufactured log, limb, or timber, or any other plant-growth or plant‑product, unprocessed or in the raw state; soil; microorganisms; live bird, reptile, nematode, insect, or any other animal in any stage of development (that is in addition to the so-called domestic animal, the quarantine of which is provided for in chapter 142); box, vehicle, baggage, or any other container in which the articles have been transported or any packing material used in connection therewith shall be made in the manner hereinafter set forth: (1)  Inspectional requirements.  Any person who receives for transport, or brings or causes movement between the islands of the State, as freight, air freight, baggage, as ship's stores, or otherwise, any of the foregoing articles, shall ensure that the articles comply with inspectional requirements pursuant to rules and shall provide upon the inspector's request the waybill number, container number, name and address of the consignor, name and address of the consignee or the consignee's agent, marks, number of packages, description of contents of each package, and any other information that may be necessary to inspect, locate, or identify the same.  If the articles are not inspected pursuant to rules, the articles shall be held in a manner that they will not spread or be likely to spread any infestation or infection of insects, diseases, or pests that may be present until an inspection can be made by the inspector to determine whether any article, or any portion thereof, is infested or infected with insects or diseases, or contains any pest. The department may adopt rules to define inspectional requirements of specific articles.  Failure to obtain certification that the articles have met the inspectional requirements prior to movement between the islands of the State is a violation of this section; (2)  Labels.  Each container in which any of the above‑mentioned articles are transported between the islands of the State shall be plainly and legibly marked, in a conspicuous manner and place, with the name and address of the shipper or owner forwarding or shipping the same, the name or mark of the person to whom the same is forwarded or shipped or the person's agent, and a statement of the contents of the container. Failure to comply with this paragraph is a violation of this section; (3)  Authority to inspect.  Whenever the inspector has good cause to believe that the provisions of this chapter are being violated, the inspector shall: (A)  Enter and inspect any aircraft, vessel, or other carrier at any time whether offshore, at the pier, or at the airport, for the purpose of determining whether any of the articles or pests enumerated in this chapter or rules adopted thereto, is present; (B)  Enter into or upon any pier, warehouse, airport, or any other place in the State where any of the above-mentioned articles are moved or stored, for the purpose of ascertaining, by inspection and examination, whether or not any of the articles is infested or infected with any pest or disease or contaminated with soil or contains prohibited plants or animals; (C)  Inspect any baggage or personal effects of passengers, officers, and crew members on aircraft or vessels moving between the islands of the State to ascertain if they contain any of the articles or pests enumerated in this chapter; (D)  Baggage or cargo inspection shall be made at the discretion of the inspector, on the pier, vessel, or aircraft or in any quarantine or inspection area; and (E)  Whenever the inspector has good cause to believe that the provisions of this chapter are being violated, the inspector shall require that any box, package, suitcase, or any other container carried as ship's stores, cargo, or otherwise by any vessel or aircraft moving between the islands of the State, be opened for inspection to determine whether any article or pest prohibited by this chapter or by rules adopted pursuant thereto is present.  It is a violation of this section if any prohibited article, pest, or any article infested with an insect or disease is found; (4)  Place of inspection.  The inspector shall make a determination whether it is necessary or advisable to move any of the above-mentioned articles, or any portion thereof, to a place more suitable for inspection than the pier, airport, or any other place where they are initially presented for inspection.  All costs and expenses incident to the movement and transportation of the articles to such place shall be borne by the consignee or the consignee's agent; (5)  Disinfection or quarantine.  If, upon inspection, any article intended for movement between the islands of the State is found to be infested or infected with an insect, disease, or pest, or there is reasonable cause to presume that it is infested or infected and the infestation or infection can, in the judgment of the inspector, be eradicated, a treatment shall be given such article prior to movement between the islands of the State.  The treatment shall be at the expense of the owner or the owner's agent, and the treatment shall be as prescribed by the department.  The article shall be quarantined at the expense of the owner or the owner's agent at a satisfactory place approved by the department for a sufficient length of time to determine that eradication has been accomplished. If the infestation or infection is of such nature or extent that it cannot be effectively and completely eradicated, or after treatment it is determined that the infestation or infection is not completely eradicated, or if the owner or the owner's agent refuses to allow the article to be treated or to be responsible for the cost of treatment and quarantine, the shipment, article, or any portion thereof, together with all packing and containers, shall not be certified for movement between the islands of the State.  An article infested or infected with an insect, disease, or pest that is not widespread in the State shall be destroyed at the expense of the owner or the owner's agent; provided that no treatment exists that would eradicate the insect, disease, or pest to the satisfaction of the department.  Such destruction shall not be made the basis of a claim against the department or the inspector for damage or loss incurred; and (6)  Disposition.  Upon completion of inspection, the inspector shall conspicuously affix to the article, container, or to the delivery order or other similar document, a tag, label, or stamp to indicate that the article has been inspected and can be moved between the islands of the State." SECTION 31.  Section 150A-14, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsections (b) through (g) to read as follows: "(b)  Any person who violates section 150A-5 or 150A-F shall be [guilty of a petty misdemeanor and] fined [not] no less than [$50] $100 and [not] no more than [$5,000.] $10,000. For a second [offense] violation committed within five years of a prior [offense,] violation, the person may be fined [not] no less than [$250] $500 and [not] no more than [$15,000.] $25,000. (c)  Any person who: (1)  Violates section 150A-6(3) or [150A-6(4),] (4), or owns or intentionally transports, possesses, harbors, transfers, or causes the importation of any snake or other prohibited animal seized under section 150A‑7(b), or whose violation involves an animal that is prohibited [or], a plant[,] that is restricted, or an animal[,] or microorganism that is restricted[,] or unlisted, without a permit, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine of [not] no less than $5,000, but [not] no more than $20,000; (2)  Intentionally transports, transfers, possesses, harbors, or imports with the intent to propagate, sell, or release any animal that is prohibited [or any plant, animal], a plant that is restricted, or an animal or microorganism that is restricted[,] or unlisted, without a permit, shall be guilty of a class C felony and subject to a fine of [not] no less than $50,000, but [not] no more than $200,000; or (3)  Intentionally imports, possesses, harbors, transfers, or transports, including through interisland or intraisland movement, with the intent to propagate, sell, or release, any pest designated by statute or rule, unless otherwise allowed by law, shall be guilty of a class C felony and subject to a fine of [not] no less than $50,000, but [not] no more than $200,000.

SECTION 12.  Section 159-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "[[]§159-2[]]  Findings and declaration of necessity.  It is hereby declared that the meat industry is a paramount agricultural industry of this State and the production and marketing of meat is an enterprise that is of significant importance to the economy of this State and to the health of the consuming public.  It is essential to the public health and welfare of consumers that they be protected by assuring that meat and meat products distributed to them are wholesome, not adulterated, and properly marked, labeled, and packaged. Unwholesome, adulterated, or misbranded meat or meat products are injurious to the public health and welfare, destroy markets for wholesome, unadulterated, and properly labeled and packaged meat and meat products and result in sundry losses to livestock producers and processors of meat and meat products, as well as injury to consumers. The unwholesome, adulterated, mislabeled, or deceptively packaged articles can be sold at lower prices and compete unfairly with the wholesome, unadulterated, and properly labeled and packaged articles, to the detriment of consumers and the public generally.  It is hereby found that regulation by the department of agriculture and biosecurity and cooperation by this State with the United States Department of Agriculture as contemplated by this Hawaii Meat Inspection Act is appropriate to protect the health and welfare of consumers and otherwise to effectuate the purposes of this chapter. Congress enacted the Meat Inspection Act in 1907 (Public Law 59-242), as amended by the Wholesome Meat Act in 1967 (Public Law 90-201) which is now redesignated as the Federal Meat Inspection Act.  The Federal Meat Inspection Act is intended to protect the consuming public from adulterated or misbranded meat and meat products and to assist the states in their efforts to accomplish this objective. The Federal Meat Inspection Act authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to furnish financial and related assistance to states for the administration of meat inspection programs which conform to established federal standards up to fifty per cent of the estimated total cost of the cooperative program.  Presently, the meat processing industry in this State is not subject to any meat inspection law or rules and regulations that meet the minimum federal requirement in this area.  This State, in order to qualify for the cooperative program, must demonstrate "progressive action" by November 15, 1969; and, further, all physical facilities must be upgraded in accordance with the established federal standards by November 15, 1970.  Failure to comply with the federal standards prescribed by the Federal Meat Inspection Act will result in federal control of the meat and meat processing industries of the State.  Accordingly, the State deems it to be in the best interest of the public health and welfare to take those steps as are necessary to qualify for federal financial and related assistance for the administration of a meat inspection program which conforms to federal standards prescribed in the Federal Meat Inspection Act." SECTION 13.  Section 161-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§161-2 Findings and declaration of necessity.  It is hereby declared that the poultry industry is a paramount agricultural industry of this State and the production and marketing of poultry is an enterprise that is of significant importance to the economy of the State and to the health of the consuming public.  It is essential to the public health and welfare of consumers that they be protected by assuring that poultry or poultry products distributed to them are wholesome, not adulterated, and properly marked, labeled, and packaged.  Unwholesome, adulterated, or misbranded poultry or poultry products are injurious to the public health and welfare, destroy markets for wholesome, not adulterated, and properly labeled and packaged poultry or poultry products, and result in sundry losses to poultry producers and processors of poultry as well as injury to consumers.  The unwholesome, adulterated, mislabeled, or deceptively packaged articles can be sold at lower prices and compete unfairly with the wholesome, not adulterated, and properly labeled and packaged articles, to the detriment of consumers and the public generally.  It is hereby found that regulation by the department of agriculture and biosecurity and cooperation by this State with the United States Department of Agriculture as contemplated by this chapter is appropriate to protect the health and welfare of consumers and otherwise to effectuate the purposes of this chapter. The 90th Congress enacted Public Law 90-492, entitled "The Wholesome Poultry Products Act", which is now redesignated as the "Poultry Products Inspection Act".  The Poultry Products Inspection Act is intended to protect the consuming public from adulterated or misbranded poultry or poultry products and to assist the states in their efforts to accomplish this objective. The Poultry Products Inspection Act authorizes the United States Secretary of Agriculture to furnish financial and related assistance to states for the administration of poultry inspection programs which conform to established federal standards up to fifty per cent of the estimated total cost of the cooperative program.  Hawaii's poultry industry is not subject to poultry inspection law or rules and regulations that meet the minimum federal requirement in this area.  In order to qualify for the cooperative program, the State must demonstrate "progressive action" by July 18, 1970; and, further, all physical facilities must be upgraded in accordance with the established federal standards by July 18, 1971.  Failure to comply with the standards prescribed by the Poultry Products Inspection Act will result in federal control of the poultry or poultry processing industries of the State.  Accordingly, the State of Hawaii deems it to be in the interest of the State's public health and welfare to take [such] steps as are necessary to qualify for federal financial and related assistance for the administration of a poultry inspection program which conforms to federal standards prescribed in the Poultry Products Inspection Act." SECTION 14.  Section 205-47, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows: "(b)  Each county shall develop maps of potential lands to be considered for designation as important agricultural lands in consultation and cooperation with landowners[,]; the department of agriculture[,] and biosecurity; agricultural interest groups, including representatives from the Hawaii Farm Bureau Federation and other agricultural organizations[,]; the United States Department of Agriculture  Natural Resources Conservation Service[,]; the office of planning and sustainable development[,]; and other groups as necessary." SECTION 15.  Section 219-8, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§219-8 Participation in loans by the department. (1)  The department of agriculture and biosecurity may provide funds for a share, not to exceed ninety per cent, of the principal amount of a loan made to a qualified aquaculturist by a private lender who is otherwise unable [otherwise] to lend the applicant sufficient funds at reasonable rates where the qualified farmer is unable to obtain sufficient funds for the same purpose from the United States Department of Agriculture; (2)  Participation loans under this section shall be limited by the provisions of section 219-6 and the department of [agriculture's] agriculture and biosecurity's share shall not exceed the maximum amounts specified therefor; (3)  Interest charged on the private lender's share of the loan shall not be more than the sum of two per cent above the lowest rate of interest charged by all state or national banks authorized to accept or hold deposits in the State on secured short term loans made to borrowers who have the highest credit rating with those banks; (4)  The private lender's share of the loan may be insured by the department up to ninety per cent of the principal balance of the loan, under section 219-7; (5)  When a participation loan has been approved by the department, its share shall be paid to the participating private lender for disbursement to the borrower.  The private lender shall collect all payments from the borrower and otherwise service the loan; (6)  Out of interest collected, the private lender may be paid a service fee to be determined by the department [which fee] that shall not exceed one per cent of the unpaid principal balance of the loan; provided that this fee shall not be added to any amount which the borrower is obligated to pay; (7)  The participating private lender may take over a larger percentage or the full principal balance of the loan at any time that it has determined, to the satisfaction of the department, that the borrower is able to pay any increased interest charges resulting; and (8)  Security for participation loans shall be limited by section 219-5(a)(6).  All collateral documents shall be held by the private lender.  Division of interest in collateral received shall be in proportion to participation by the department and the private lender." SECTION 16.  Section 460J-26, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§460J-26 Exemptions.  This chapter shall not apply to: (1)  Officials of the federal government on military reservations; (2)  Personnel of the United States Department of Agriculture, [the] state department of agriculture[, or] and biosecurity, state department of land and natural resources, or [the] United States Public Health Service in the performance of their official duties; (3)  Other government employees who conduct research on pesticides or pest control or who use pesticides in the performance of their duties; (4)  Qualified scientific personnel specially exempted by the board; (5)  Persons engaged in pest control for agricultural purposes; or (6)  Engineers or architects licensed under chapter 464 who: (A)  Draft or prepare design documents that prescribe anti-termite or anti-pest measures, including the specification of termiticides, that are required by the building code and other governmental agencies; (B)  Conduct building condition or assessment surveys to observe and evaluate the condition of the building or structure, if the primary purpose of these surveys is not to report on the identification of infestations; or (C)  Prepare reports based on the results of the surveys specified in subparagraph (B) that identify the location, extent, and probable cause of the pest damage (e.g., "termite damage"); provided that where a report concerns termite damage, the particular type or species of termite shall not be specified unless the report is written in consultation with a licensed pest control operator licensed in termite control or other duly recognized expert in urban entomology, such as an insect taxonomist or urban entomologist with expertise in the identification or control of termites; and provided further that if a licensed pest control operator is not consulted, the report shall include a recommendation that a licensed pest control operator be contracted for further assessment or treatment."

SECTION 21.  Chapter 141, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§141-     Deputy chairperson for biosecurity; established.  (a)  There is established within the department a deputy chairperson for biosecurity.  The deputy chairperson for biosecurity shall oversee all of the department's biosecurity initiatives, including programs under chapters 142 and 150A and sections 141-5, 261-4.5, and 266-21.5. (b)  The deputy chairperson for biosecurity shall be a deputy to the chairperson of the board of agriculture and biosecurity and be appointed, without regard to chapter 76, by the governor.  The salary of the deputy chairperson for biosecurity shall be as provided in section 26-53 for first deputies or first assistants to the head of any department." PART III SECTION 22.  Chapter 150A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part VI to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§150A-     Biosecurity emergency.  (a)  The department, with the approval of the governor, may declare a biosecurity emergency if: (1)  There has been in the State an outbreak or occurrence of a pest or prohibited or restricted organism that has the potential to cause significant economic or environmental loss if the pest or organism becomes established in the State; (2)  There is established in one area of the State a pest or prohibited or restricted organism that has the potential to cause significant economic or environmental loss if the pest or organism expands to other areas within a county or becomes established in another area of the State; or (3)  A pest or prohibited or restricted organism is, or threatens to be, beyond the State's ability to control. (b)  A biosecurity emergency shall automatically terminate one hundred calendar days after its declaration, unless the declaration is extended by the department with the approval of the governor. (c)  For the duration of a declared biosecurity emergency: (1)  The department shall be exempt from chapter 103D; (2)  The Hawaii invasive species council shall work with the chairperson; and (3)  The governor may transfer moneys to the department from any account within the governor's control. (d)  The governor may requisition and take control of any goods, real property, or watercraft required for the purposes of this section, or requisition and take control of the temporary use thereof; provided that: (1)  This subsection shall not apply to any vessel that: (A)  Has anti-fouling hull coating; and (B)  Does not discharge ballast water, uses freshwater for ballasting, or is equipped with ultraviolet filtration systems for ballast water; (2)  The requisition shall be made by serving notice upon any person found in occupation of the premises or having the property in the person's custody, possession, or control, and a like notice shall also be served upon any person who has filed with the governor, or with a person the governor designates for the purpose, a request for notice with respect to the property; provided further that if any person entitled to compensation for the property is unable to be served, the governor shall publish a notice of the requisition at the earliest practicable date; and (3)  A requisition shall terminate automatically one hundred calendar days after the declaration of a biosecurity emergency, or by a separate proclamation of the governor, whichever occurs first. (e)  If the governor requisitions and takes control of any property or the temporary use thereof, the owner, or other person entitled thereto, shall be paid a sum, determined by the governor to be fair and just compensation for the property or use, within twenty days after the property has been requisitioned and taken, or in monthly or lesser installments if the property is taken for temporary use. If any person is unwilling to accept the sum determined by the governor as full and complete compensation for the property or use, the person shall be paid seventy-five per cent of that sum and may sue the State for an additional sum that, when added to the sum already received by the person, the person may consider fair and just compensation for the property or use, in the manner provided by chapter 661 for actions against the State; provided that: (1)  Any suit under this section shall be instituted within two years after the requisition in the case of the taking of real property in fee simple, or within one year after the requisition in all other cases, subject to sections 657-13 to 657-15, which are hereby made applicable to the suit; (2)  No more than six months shall be allowed for the bringing of a suit after the appointment of a conservator of a person under disability, or the removal of the disability, or after the appointment of personal representatives; and (3)  Recovery shall be confined to the fair market value of the property or its fair rental value, as the case may be, without any allowance for prospective profits, or punitive or other damages. If the owner of property, or other person entitled to compensation for the requisitioning of property or use thereof, is under a disability, or has died, and no conservator or personal representative has been appointed, the State, acting through the attorney general, may apply for the appointment of a conservator or for the appointment of a personal representative. (f)  The governor shall appoint a board of three disinterested certified appraisers with whom may be filed any claim for damages arising out of any failure to return private property, the temporary use of which was requisitioned, or which was leased, or any claim for damages arising out of the condition in which the private property is returned.  No claim may be filed for deterioration of property resulting from ordinary wear and tear and not for any deterioration or damage, except any that is shown to have resulted from the taking or use of the property; provided that any claim shall be filed within thirty days after the return of the property or after the governor proclaims that all private property has been returned to the owners, whichever is earlier.  The decision of the appraisers shall be final and binding upon the governor and the claimant.  Either party may file a petition in the circuit court within sixty days after the rendering of a decision of the board of appraisers, praying for the decision of the court upon the claim.  The petition, if filed by the State, shall be entitled in the name of the State by the attorney general and shall be heard and decided by the circuit court without the intervention of a jury.  If filed by any other party, the petition shall be filed, heard, and decided in the manner provided for suits against the State.  Appellate review may be had, subject to chapter 602, in the manner provided for civil appeals from the circuit courts.  The court may order the joinder of other parties or may allow other parties to intervene.  Any award that has become final shall be paid out of any funds available under this chapter and, if not sufficient, out of the general revenues of the State as appropriated." SECTION 23.  Section 150A-52, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§150A-52  Objectives of biosecurity program.  The objectives of the biosecurity program shall be to: (1)  Establish a multi-dimensional system to survey for and prevent the entry into the State and interisland movement of pests and prohibited or restricted organisms without a permit; (2)  Respond effectively to eradicate, control, reduce, and suppress incipient pest populations and established pests and seize and dispose of prohibited or restricted organisms without a permit; and (3)  Coordinate with partner agencies and organizations to direct the control and eradication of [invasive species.] pests." SECTION 24.  Section 150A-53, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§150A-53  General actions to achieve objectives.  (a)  To achieve the objectives of the biosecurity program, the department shall plan for and, within available legislative appropriations or through funding from other sources, implement the following: (1)  Work with government agencies and agricultural commodity exporters of other states and countries to establish pre-entry inspection programs under which inbound cargo into the State is inspected at the ports of departure or other points outside the State; (2)  Establish, operate, or participate in operating port-of-entry facilities where multiple government agencies may inspect, quarantine, fumigate, disinfect, destroy, or exclude as appropriate, articles that may harbor pests or prohibited or restricted organisms or exclude articles that are prohibited or restricted without a permit, with the goals of: (A)  Performing inspections in an efficient, effective, and expeditious manner for the government agencies involved and for cargo owners, carriers, and importers; and (B)  Providing for the proper and safe storage and handling of cargo, especially agricultural and food commodities, awaiting inspection; (3)  Develop, implement, and coordinate post-entry measures to eradicate, control, reduce, and suppress pests and, as appropriate, eradicate or seize and dispose of prohibited or restricted organisms without a permit that have entered the State; (4)  Collaborate with relevant government agencies, agricultural commodity importers, and other persons to examine and develop joint integrated systems to better implement the biosecurity program; (5)  Improve cargo inspection capabilities and methods, including enhancement of the content and submission requirements for cargo manifests and agricultural commodity ownership and movement certificates; (6)  Promote the production of agricultural commodities in the State to reduce cargo shipments of imported commodities into the State; and (7)  Provide public education on [the]: (A)  The negative effects of pests and prohibited or restricted organisms without a permit, to the environment and economy of the State[.]; (B)  Reporting pests and prohibited or restricted organisms without a permit that are discovered or suspected to be present in imported products; and (C)  Protecting imported products to prevent pest infestation. (b)  For purposes of the biosecurity program, the department may: (1)  Subpoena any necessary documentation from importers relating to a discovered or suspected infestation of a pest or prohibited or restricted organism; and (2)  Declare a biosecurity emergency pursuant to section 150A-   . [(b)] (c)  The department shall establish parameters and construction requirements for biosecurity facilities that provide for and ensure the safety of agricultural and food commodities consumed by Hawaii residents, including cold storage facilities established by private-public partnerships to preserve the quality and ensure the safety of the commodities arriving at the State's airports and harbors." PART IV SECTION 25.  The legislature finds that New Zealand's use of transitional facilities has increased the country's biosecurity while improving the efficiency of importing goods.  In New Zealand, most imported goods subject to inspection are transported away from the airport or seaport to one of six thousand five hundred privately-run secure transitional facilities.  At the transitional facility, a private individual licensed by the government inspects the goods for disease, infection, infestation, and other matters of concern. The legislature further finds that New Zealand's process allows for a more efficient flow of goods entering the country by reducing delays or stoppages at the ports of entry while also ensuring that all relevant goods are properly inspected before delivery to their destination. The purpose of this part is to enhance Hawaii's biosecurity measures by authorizing the establishment of similar transitional facilities in the State along with licenses for private individuals to inspect the imported goods. SECTION 26.  Chapter 150A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding five new sections to part II to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: "§150A-A  Transitional facilities; uses.  (a) Upon notification by the department, items at a pier, airport, or other place where the items are first received may be transported to a transitional facility suitable for the items. (b)  Items transported pursuant to subsection (a) shall be transported in a manner that they will not spread or be likely to spread any infestation or infection of insects or diseases that may be present. (c)  All costs and expenses incident to the use of a transitional facility shall be borne by the importer or the importer's agent.  For the purposes of this subsection, "import" (and any nounal, verbal, adjectival, adverbial, and other equivalent for the term used interchangeably in this subsection) means to bring or attempt to bring goods or products into the State, and includes items labeled or designated as samples, even if not intended for retail sale, subject to this chapter. (d)  No items shall be transported out of a transitional facility unless: (1)  Authorized by the department; or (2)  Certified by a biosecurity compliance auditor that the items are free of diseases, infections, infestations, and other items that the department deems relevant. §150A-B  Transitional facilities; established.  The department shall establish standards for transitional facilities, including standards for the construction, maintenance, and operation of transitional facilities.  The department may establish standards for transitional facilities pursuant to the types of items stored by those facilities, and corresponding classes of licensure. §150A-C  Transitional facility license.  (a) No person shall operate a transitional facility without a transitional facility license and under the terms of a signed compliance agreement. (b)  A person may apply to the department for a transitional facility license.  The application shall be made under oath on forms provided by the department and shall contain information as prescribed by the department, including the following: (1)  The name, business address, telephone number, social security number, and, where applicable, the federal tax identification number of the applicant; (2)  The proposed location of the transitional facility; and (3)  The type of items the transitional facility will hold. (c)  The department shall establish standards for transitional facilities, including: (1)  Standards for construction, maintenance, security, and operation; and (2)  Quarterly inspections; provided that the department may perform periodic random inspections to ensure compliance. (d)  The department may suspend or revoke a transitional facility license if the transitional facility does not satisfy the standards established by the department under subsection (c) or the department determines that the transitional facility is not in compliance under the terms of the compliance agreement. §150A-D  Biosecurity compliance auditor; certification.  (a)  The department shall certify biosecurity compliance auditors and offer training to individuals seeking a biosecurity compliance auditor certification. (b)  The training shall include: (1)  The identification of diseases, infections, infestations, and other subjects that the department deems relevant; and (2)  Procedures following the identification of a disease, infection, infestation, or other subject that the department deems relevant. (c)  Upon completion of the training and satisfaction of other requirements under the compliance agreement, the department shall issue a biosecurity compliance auditor certification to the individual.  The certification shall be valid for one year, shall identify the specific transitional facility where the biosecurity compliance auditor is authorized to conduct compliance audits, and may be renewed under requirements established by the department. (d)  The department may require each biosecurity compliance auditor to complete additional training as needed, including any emergency training in the interests of biosecurity. (e)  The department may revoke or suspend any biosecurity compliance auditor certification for good cause.

Baggage or cargo inspection shall be made at the discretion of the inspector, on the pier, vessel, or aircraft or in any quarantine or inspection area. Whenever the inspector has good cause to believe that the provisions of this chapter are being violated, the inspector may require that any box, package, suitcase, or any other container carried as ship's stores, cargo, or otherwise by any vessel or aircraft moving between the continental United States and Hawaii or between the [Hawaiian Islands,] islands of the State, be opened for inspection to determine whether any article or pest prohibited by this chapter or by rules adopted pursuant thereto is present.  It is a violation of this section if any prohibited article or any pest or any plant, fruit, or vegetable infested with plant pests is found; [(6)] (5)  Request for importation and inspection.  In addition to requirements of the United States customs authorities concerning invoices or other formalities incident to importations into the State, the importer shall be required to file a written statement with the department, signed by the importer or the importer's agent, setting forth the importer's desire to import certain of the above-mentioned articles into the State and: (A)  Giving the following additional information: (i)  The kind (scientific name), quantity, and description; (ii)  The locality where same were grown or produced; (iii)  Certification that all animals to be imported are the progeny of captive populations or have been held in captivity for a period of one year immediately before importation or have been specifically approved for importation by the board; (iv)  The port from which the same were last shipped; (v)  The name of the shipper; and (vi)  The name of the consignee; and (B)  Containing: (i)  A request that the department, by its duly authorized agent, examine the articles described; (ii)  An agreement by the importer to be responsible for all costs, charges, or expenses; and (iii)  A waiver of all claims for damages incident to the inspection or the fumigation, disinfection, quarantine, or destruction of the articles, or any of them, as hereinafter provided, if any treatment is deemed necessary. Failure or refusal to file a statement, including the agreement and waiver, is a violation of this section and may, in the discretion of the department, be sufficient cause for refusing to permit the entry of the articles into the State; [(7)] (6)  Place of inspection.  If, in the judgment of the [inspector,] department, it is deemed necessary or advisable to move any of the above-mentioned articles, or any portion thereof, to a transitional facility or another place more suitable for inspection than the pier, airport, or any other place where they are first received or discharged, the [inspector] department is authorized to do so[.] or order the importer or importer's agent to do so.  All costs and expenses incident to the movement and transportation of the articles to any other place shall be borne by the importer or the importer's agent.  If the importer, importer's agent, or transportation company requests inspection of sealed containers of the above-mentioned articles at locations other than where the articles are first received or discharged or a transitional facility and the department determines that inspection at the other place is appropriate, the department may require payment of costs necessitated by these inspections, including overtime costs; [(8)] (7)  Disinfection or quarantine.  If, upon inspection, any article received or brought into the State for the purpose of debarkation or entry therein is found to be infested or infected or there is reasonable cause to presume that it is infested or infected and the infestation or infection can, in the judgment of the inspector, be eradicated, a treatment shall be given [such] to the article.  The treatment shall be at the expense of the owner or the owner's agent, and the treatment shall be as prescribed by the department.  The article shall be held in quarantine at the expense of the owner or the owner's agent at a satisfactory place approved by the department for a sufficient length of time to determine that eradication has been accomplished.  If the infestation or infection is of the nature or extent that it cannot be effectively and completely eradicated, or if it is a potentially destructive pest or it is not widespread in the State, or after treatment it is determined that the infestation or infection is not completely eradicated, or if the owner or the owner's agent refuses to allow the article to be treated or to be responsible for the cost of treatment and quarantine, the article, or any portion thereof, together with all packing and containers, may, at the discretion of the inspector, be destroyed or sent out of the State at the expense of the owner or the owner's agent.  The destruction or exclusion shall not be made the basis of a claim against the department or the inspector for damage or loss incurred; [(9)] (8)  Disposition.  Upon completion of inspection, either at the time of arrival or at any time thereafter should any article be held for inspection, treatment, or quarantine, the inspector shall affix to the article or the container or to the delivery order in a conspicuous place thereon, a tag, label, or stamp to indicate that the article has been inspected and passed.  This action shall constitute a permit to bring the article into the State; and [(10)] (9)  Ports of entry.  None of the articles mentioned in this section shall be allowed entry into the State except through the airports and seaports in the State designated and approved by the board." SECTION 29.  Section 150A-5.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows: "(b)  In legal effect, articles landed for the purpose of inspection or quarantine shall be construed to be still outside the State seeking entry, and shall not, in whole or in part, be considered suitable for entry into the State unless a tag, label, or stamp has been affixed to the article, its container, or its delivery order by the inspector as provided in section [150A-5(9),] 150A-5(8), except that articles quarantined in the biocontrol containment facilities of the department or of other government agencies engaged in joint projects with the department may be released upon issuance of a permit approved by the board." SECTION 30.  Section 150A-8, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows: "§150A-8 Transporting in State.  (a)  Flora and fauna specified by rules and regulations of the department shall not be moved from one island to another island within the State or from one locality to another on the same island except by a permit issued by the department.

The department may adopt rules to define inspectional requirements of specific articles.  Failure to obtain certification that the articles have met the inspectional requirements prior to movement between the islands of the State is a violation of this section; (2)  Labels.  Each container in which any of the above‑mentioned articles are transported between the islands of the State shall be plainly and legibly marked, in a conspicuous manner and place, with the name and address of the shipper or owner forwarding or shipping the same, the name or mark of the person to whom the same is forwarded or shipped or the person's agent, and a statement of the contents of the container. Failure to comply with this paragraph is a violation of this section; (3)  Authority to inspect.  Whenever the inspector has good cause to believe that the provisions of this chapter are being violated, the inspector shall: (A)  Enter and inspect any aircraft, vessel, or other carrier at any time whether offshore, at the pier, or at the airport, for the purpose of determining whether any of the articles or pests enumerated in this chapter or rules adopted thereto, is present; (B)  Enter into or upon any pier, warehouse, airport, or any other place in the State where any of the above-mentioned articles are moved or stored, for the purpose of ascertaining, by inspection and examination, whether or not any of the articles is infested or infected with any pest or disease or contaminated with soil or contains prohibited plants or animals; (C)  Inspect any baggage or personal effects of passengers, officers, and crew members on aircraft or vessels moving between the islands of the State to ascertain if they contain any of the articles or pests enumerated in this chapter; (D)  Baggage or cargo inspection shall be made at the discretion of the inspector, on the pier, vessel, or aircraft or in any quarantine or inspection area; and (E)  Whenever the inspector has good cause to believe that the provisions of this chapter are being violated, the inspector shall require that any box, package, suitcase, or any other container carried as ship's stores, cargo, or otherwise by any vessel or aircraft moving between the islands of the State, be opened for inspection to determine whether any article or pest prohibited by this chapter or by rules adopted pursuant thereto is present.  It is a violation of this section if any prohibited article, pest, or any article infested with an insect or disease is found; (4)  Place of inspection.  The inspector shall make a determination whether it is necessary or advisable to move any of the above-mentioned articles, or any portion thereof, to a place more suitable for inspection than the pier, airport, or any other place where they are initially presented for inspection.  All costs and expenses incident to the movement and transportation of the articles to such place shall be borne by the consignee or the consignee's agent; (5)  Disinfection or quarantine.  If, upon inspection, any article intended for movement between the islands of the State is found to be infested or infected with an insect, disease, or pest, or there is reasonable cause to presume that it is infested or infected and the infestation or infection can, in the judgment of the inspector, be eradicated, a treatment shall be given such article prior to movement between the islands of the State.  The treatment shall be at the expense of the owner or the owner's agent, and the treatment shall be as prescribed by the department.  The article shall be quarantined at the expense of the owner or the owner's agent at a satisfactory place approved by the department for a sufficient length of time to determine that eradication has been accomplished. If the infestation or infection is of such nature or extent that it cannot be effectively and completely eradicated, or after treatment it is determined that the infestation or infection is not completely eradicated, or if the owner or the owner's agent refuses to allow the article to be treated or to be responsible for the cost of treatment and quarantine, the shipment, article, or any portion thereof, together with all packing and containers, shall not be certified for movement between the islands of the State.  An article infested or infected with an insect, disease, or pest that is not widespread in the State shall be destroyed at the expense of the owner or the owner's agent; provided that no treatment exists that would eradicate the insect, disease, or pest to the satisfaction of the department.  Such destruction shall not be made the basis of a claim against the department or the inspector for damage or loss incurred; and (6)  Disposition.  Upon completion of inspection, the inspector shall conspicuously affix to the article, container, or to the delivery order or other similar document, a tag, label, or stamp to indicate that the article has been inspected and can be moved between the islands of the State."

(e)  The department may, at its discretion, refuse entry, confiscate, or destroy any prohibited [articles or], restricted, or unlisted articles that are brought into the State without a permit issued by the department, or order the return of any plant, fruit, vegetable, or any other article infested with insects, diseases, or pests to its place of origin or otherwise dispose of it or such part thereof as may be necessary to comply with this chapter. Any expense or loss in connection therewith shall be borne by the owner or the owner's agent.

The deputy chairperson for biosecurity shall be responsible for ensuring compliance with this section." PART VI SECTION 36.  The legislature finds that treating plant care components, which includes any quantity of wood chips, compost, or filter socks, reduces potential pests and increases the State's overall biosecurity.  Act 197, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024 (Act 197), requires the department of agriculture to certify plant care component treatments performed within the State.  The purpose of this part is to expressly provide the department of agriculture and biosecurity with the rulemaking authority to adopt administrative rules and to assess administrative penalties to fully effectuate Act 197.
